HONBLE SRI JUSTICE D.V.S.S. SOMAYAJULU         
AS No.998 of 1995, Tr.AS No.3464 of 2003 
and Cross-Appeal in Tr.AS No.3464 of 2003 

COMMON JUDGMENT:       
</p><p id="p_6">        The appeal AS No.998 of 1995 is filed by the Andhra
Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Limited
(APIIC) and another against the judgment and decree
dated 27.03.1995 passed in OS No.151 of 1987 by the 
Additional Subordinate Judge, Ranga Reddy District.
The said suit is filed by APIIC and another against Rama
Tubes Company and 9 others claiming reliefs of delivery
of vacant possession, mesne profits etc.
     Transfer AS No.3464 of 2003 is filed by APIIC
against the judgment and decree dated 27.03.1995 
passed in OS No.267 of 1993 by the Additional
Subordinate Judge, Ranga Reddy District.  This suit was
filed by Rama Tubes Company.  The cross-appeal in 
Tr.AS No.3464 of 2003 are filed by Rama Tubes Company   
against APIIC aggrieved by certain findings in OS No.267
of 1993.
</p><p id="p_7">     The case of the plaintiffs in OS No.151 of 1987 in a
nutshell is that on 09.12.1976 they have entered into
agreement with the first defendant-Rama Tubes
Company and had given possession of the suit schedule 
property to the said company. As the first defendant
company did not adhere to the terms and conditions, the
allotment was cancelled by letter dated 19.12.1977.  After
a long time due to protracted correspondence, a fresh
offer of re-allotment was given but as the same was not
accepted, the suit was filed for delivery of vacant
possession and mesne profits, as the plaintiffs state that
the defendants let out the suit schedule property to
others.
</p><p id="p_8">     The defendants contested the suit on various
grounds and also brought to the notice of the lower Court
that a suit in OS No.267 of 1993 was filed for specific
performance of the very same agreement of sale dated
09.12.1976.
</p><p id="p_9">     OS No.267 of 1993 is filed by Rama Tubes Company 
for enforcing the agreement of sale dated 09.12.1976.
The case of the plaintiff in the said suit is that they were
given possession of the property and that the cancellation
of the same is not correct. They state that they are
always ready and willing to get the sale deed executed.
Therefore, they state that they are entitled for specific
performance. In reply thereto, APIIC states that there was
failure on the part of the plaintiff and that the agreement
was cancelled.  Therefore, there is no agreement to be
enforced. A fresh offer for re-allotment did not also
fructify and they have also raised a plea that the case is
barred by limitation.
</p><p id="p_10">     The issues in OS No.151 of 1987 are as follows:
</p><p id="p_11">1.      Whether the agreement of sale dated 09.12.1976 is
true and valid and binding on the plaintiffs?
</p><p id="p_12">2.      Whether the leasing of the property to D.2 to D.10
is contrary and illegal?
</p><p id="p_13">3.      Whether the plaintiff is entitled for possession of
the property?
</p><p id="p_14">4.      Whether the plaintiff is entitled for mesne profits? If
so how much quantum?   
</p><p id="p_15">5.      To what relief?
</p>
<p id="p_16">     The issues in OS No.267 of 1993 are as follows:
</p><p id="p_17">1.      Whether the suit is barred by limitation?
</p><p id="p_18">2.      Whether the contract between the parties is no
more in force?
</p><p id="p_19">3.      Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the specific
performance of the agreement of sale?
</p><p id="p_20">4.      To what relief?
</p>
<p id="p_21">     It transpires that both the suits were tried together
and evidence was let in OS No.267 of 1993. For the
plaintiff, one witness was examined as PW.1 and Exs.A.1 
to A.28 were marked. For the defendant, one witness was 
examined as DW.1 and Exs.B.1 to B.23 were marked.  By    
a common judgment that was passed on 27.03.1995, the   
lower Court decreed the suit OS No.267 of 1993, which
was filed for specific performance and dismissed the suit
OS No.151 of 1987, which is filed for eviction.
</p><p id="p_22">     As mentioned at the outset, AS No.998 of 1995 is
filed against the decree in OS No.151 of 1987 and Tr.AS
No.3464 of 2003 is filed against the judgment and decree
in OS No.267 of 1993. In this Tr.AS No.3464 of 2003,
there is a cross-appeal also.
</p><p id="p_23">     This Court has heard Sri L. Prabhakar Reddy,
learned standing counsel for appellant/APIIC in AS
No.998 of 1995 and Sri Vedula Venkata Ramana, learned  
senior counsel appearing on behalf of Sri M.P.
Chandramouli, learned counsel for the respondents.
Both the learned counsel relied upon a compilation of
pleadings and documents, which are prepared by Sri 
M.P. Chandramouli, learned counsel for the respondents.
This compilation consists the grounds of appeal in AS
No.998 of 1995, the grounds of Transfer Appeal in
Tr.A.S.No.3464 of 2003 and the cross-appeal filed in
Tr.A.S.No.3464 of 2003. In addition, all the documents
which are marked in the lower Court viz., Exs.A.1 to
A.28, Exs.B.1 to B.23 are filed along with the depositions
of the witnesses.  Both the learned counsel agreed that
on the basis of this volume of compilation, the arguments
in AS No.998 of 1998, in Tr.A.S.No.3464 of 2003 and in
Cross-appeal in Tr.A.S.No.3464 of 2003 could be heard
altogether.
</p><p id="p_24">     The facts which are admitted and not in controversy
in these cases are a) that there is an agreement of
sale/allotment dated 09.12.1976, which is marked as
Ex.A.1/B.5 in between the present appellant and the first
respondent; and b) possession of the property is also
delivered to the first respondent, pursuant to the said
agreement of sale.
</p><p id="p_25">     The appellant/APIIC states that as the first
respondent did not comply with the terms and conditions
of Ex.A.1/B.5-agreement of sale, they had to revoke/
cancel the same. After the revocation in view of the long
correspondence, a fresh offer was given to the first
respondent in Ex.A.8/B.19 for restoration of possession,
but the defendant-first respondent did not comply with
the terms and conditions of the fresh offer also.  The first
respondent on the other hand states that the agreement
of sale dated 09.12.1976 (Ex.A.1/B.5) is not cancelled
and that they are entitled to specific performance.
Hence, the points that arise for consideration in this
appeal are follows:
</p><p id="p_26">i)      Whether the first respondent committed
any breach of the terms of the agreement
(Ex.A.1/B.5); if yes, whether the
appellant rightly terminated the same?
</p><p id="p_27">ii)     Whether the cancellation of Ex.A.1/B.5
has been revoked; and 
</p><p id="p_28">iii)    Whether Ex.A.8/B.19 is a fresh offer or
the continuation of Ex.A.1/B.5.
</p><p id="p_29">If Ex.A.8/B.19 is a fresh offer, whether
the first respondent complied with the
new terms. 
</p><p id="p_30">iv)     As a consequence of the decision on the
first point, is the appellant entitled to a
decree for eviction and mesne profits or is
the first respondent is entitled to specific
performance. 
</p>
<p id="p_31">     As mentioned earlier, both the parties introduced
oral and documentary evidence.  The crux of the matter
is the agreement dated 09.12.1976 and its terms and
conditions. The said agreement is marked as Ex.A.1/B.5.
The important terms and conditions which have bearing
on these cases are:
</p><p id="p_32">Clauses (2): The Company shall, as a condition
precedent to being placed in possession of the plot
allotted, make an initial payment of not less than
Rs.4,840/- per acre.
</p>
<p id="p_33">(3)     The Company hereby agree to execute a  
promissory note in favour of the Corporation for the
balance of unpaid cost of the land plus development
charges allotted to them on the basis of the cost
tentatively arrived at Rs.9,680/- per acre.     
</p>
<p id="p_34">(5)     The date and time of payment is essence of the
contract.
</p>
<p id="p_35">(6)     Only on the completion and full payment of the
entire consideration amount, the sale deed shall be
executed and registered in the name of the company.
</p>
<p id="p_36">(10)    The Company undertakes and agrees to pay the  
Corporation proportionate to the property allotted to
the company and further amount in case the 
Corporation is finally obliged to pay any high sum
towards development charges and enhanced   
compensation towards the cost of acquisition of the
land.  This will be without prejudice to the right of the
financing agency approved by the Corporation as first
mortgagees. 
</p>
<p id="p_37">(11)    The Company expressly agree to execute a  
promissory note to cover any further amount, when
called for, to cover the entire sum determined towards
development charges and enhanced compensation    
towards the cost of the acquisition of the land, within
fifteen days from the date of receipt of such
communication from the Corporation. 
</p>
<p id="p_38">(c)     The Company shall, within six months of being
put in possession of the said land, commence
construction of the factory buildings after securing
necessary clearance from the Corporation authorities
and complete them in not later than 18 months.  
</p>
<p id="p_39">(f)     That the land shall not be transferred or
conveyed to any other person or persons within ten
years after the unit starts functioning.
</p>
<p id="p_40">(m)     Not to assign, underlet, sub-let, or part with the
possession of the land or any part thereof without first
obtaining the written consent of the Corporation till a
proper registered sale deed is executed.
</p>
<p id="p_41">(s)     That if the Company commits a breach of any of
the covenants herein contained its shall be lawful for
the Corporation to re-enter upon the said land and
take possession thereof and also of the buildings
standing thereon; the transfer made in favour of the
company in the said land and in any building thereon
shall alone cease and determine.
</p>
<p id="p_42">15.     If the instalment hereby restored or any part
thereof shall be unpaid on the date it become payable
or if any contract on the Companys part herein
contained shall not be performed or observed, there in
any of the case it shall be lawful for the Corporation at
any time thereafter, to re-enter upon the premises in
the name of the whole and thereupon this agreement 
shall absolutely be determined without prejudice to
the right of the Corporation to seek such remedy in
respect of breach of the Companys covenant is herein
contained.
</p>
<p id="p_43">17.     The Corporation shall have right to resume the
land, if the Company do not use the land for the
purpose for whom it was allotted within the period
specific above, the period to be reckoned from the date
on which the company was placed in possession of the 
land.
</p>
<p id="p_44">22.     All payments due to the Corporation under this
agreement shall carry interest at 12%.  All payments
made/instalments paid after the due dates carry penal
interest at 18% per annum.
</p>
<p id="p_45">     A reading of these clauses makes it clear that the
initial advance paid is Rs.4,840/- and the balance costs
tentatively estimated was an equal amount of Rs.4,840/-.
Clause-6 clearly states that they only on completion of
the full payment, the sale deed shall be executed.
Clauses-10 and 11 say that extra amounts can be 
demanded by APIIC. Clause (e) clearly stipulates that the
factory to be constructed in the suit schedule property
shall be started within six months and completed not
later than 18 months.  Clause (f) prohibits the transfer of
land within a period of 10 years after the unit starts
functioning. Clause (m) prohibits the assignment;
underleting and subletting or parting with the possession
of the land or any part thereof. Clause (s) states if the
first respondent commits a breach of the agreement or
the covenants, it is lawful for the appellant to re-enter the
land and take possession thereof.  Clause-15 also states
that if any instalment is unpaid or if any covenant on the
part of the first respondent is not performed or observed,
then the appellant can determine the contract. Clause-17
also states that if the company does not use the land for
the purpose for which it is given, the first respondent can
resume the land.
</p><p id="p_46">     These clauses are being highlighted at the very
outset, in view of the fact that there is a serious dispute
about the breach of contract. If the appellant is
successful in proving the breach of contract, then their
actions in seeking eviction, mesne profits are justified.  If
on the other hand, it is proved that there is no breach
condition, the first respondent is entitled to protection.
</p><p id="p_47">        This Court has heard Sri L. Prabhakar Reddy,
learned standing counsel for the appellant/APIIC. He
draws the attention of this Court to the terms and
conditions of the contract. According to the learned
counsel, the first respondent did not adhere to any of the
terms and conditions of the contract. He points out about
Ex.A.3 in which it is clearly admitted in para-1 that the
construction could not be commenced for the last three
years because of the recession conditions in the market.
He also pointed out that in para-6, the first respondent
admits that they have approached APSFC for a loan.  He 
points out even in Ex.A.6 dated 15.02.1983, which is
more than six years after Ex.A.1, the same averment is
made. 
</p><p id="p_48">     The learned counsel draws the attention of this
Court to clause (e), which states that the company shall
within six months of being put in possession commence 
the construction of the factory building after obtaining
permission from the appellant and complete the
construction within 18 years. He also draws the attention
to Clauses-3 and 15 wherein right is reserved by the
Corporation to cancel the agreement in case of breach of
any of the conditions.  It is the contention of the learned
counsel for the appellant that there is virtually no
evidence from the appellants side to show that the
construction commenced and was completed within the   
said period of 18 months. The learned counsel points out
that the cancellation was done by Ex.B.12-letter dated
19.12.1997.  He draws the attention of this Court to the
fact that in the agreement it is clearly mentioned that the
construction of factory building must be completed
within 18 months and argues that as the said
construction was not completed, the allotment was
cancelled by Ex.B.12.  The learned counsel draws the
attention of this Court to the immediate reply given to
this letter, which is marked as Ex. B.12 in which the first
respondent clearly admits that they are applying the
Gram Panchayat for starting the construction. The
company also requests for revocation of the cancellation.
Even in Ex.B.4 letter, the appellant clearly points out
that in 1980 the respondent is yet to commence the
construction. Hence, the learned standing counsel
justifies the cancellation of the argument.
</p><p id="p_49">     In reply to this, the learned senior counsel for the
first respondent argues that the land that was delivered
was not ready for construction.  He also points out that
the building was constructed and completed and states
that the prayer in the suit itself is for recovery of
possession and mesne profits on the ground that the
factory is let out to others. He also points out that the
efforts of the first respondent were not appreciated and
that a hyper technical view was taken by the appellant-
Corporation. It is his case that the suit for eviction is filed
after the suit for specific performance and as a
counterblast. He argues that unless the reciprocal
obligations are offered, the first respondent cannot be
called upon to offer its part of the bargains. He also
argues that the conditions in Ex.B.12 are vague and a
term like usual interest is introduced without any
clarity.
</p><p id="p_50">     After hearing both the counsel on this point, this
Court is of the opinion that there is no documentary
evidence available to show that the first respondent
commenced the construction as required under the 
agreement under Ex.A.1/B.5 dated 19.12.197. Even after 
possession was granted, the first respondent did not
commence the construction. Ex.B.12 letter dated 
19.12.1977 was given exactly one year after Ex.A.1.  The
termination/cancellation was on the basis of the failure
of the first respondent to commence and complete the
construction of the building.  It is clearly mentioned that
the appellants have not taken any steps for starting the
industry and for paying the balance sale consideration.
The learned counsel for the appellant is right in pointing
out that the balance sale consideration of Rs.4,840/- was
due and payable within six months from Ex.A.1s date, as
can be seen from clause-4.  There is no evidence to show
the payment or the tender of the same within six months.
</p>
<p id="p_51">     The immediate reply of the first respondent does not
in any way contradict the averments in the letter of
cancellation. The further correspondence of the first
respondent as can be seen Ex.B.17 talks of revocation
and re-allotment of the land only. The learned counsel
for the appellants also points out that other letters like
Ex.A.6 dated 15.02.1983 also talk of revocation of the
cancellation. Even in Ex.A.7 dated 25.07.1983, there was
a prayer for revocation of the cancellation. Therefore, it is
clear that the first respondent was fully conscious of the
cancellation of the agreement. No positive evidence has
been introduced to show that the construction of factory
had actually commenced within a period of six months.
No extenuating circumstances are also proved to excuse 
the delay. No proof is filed to show that the balance sale
consideration was tendered within six months as per
clause-4. The parties entered into the realm of a
concluded contract and they cannot avoid the terms
unless they can plead and establish a failure on the part
of the appellant. In the case of <a href="/doc/1664346/" id="a_1">Indu Kakkar v. Haryana
State Industrial Development Corporation Ltd</a>. , similar
clauses and the action taken thereunder were upheld by
the Honble Supreme Court of India.
</p><p id="p_52">     The terms and conditions of Ex.A.1 agreement are
clear and there is also a clear violation of the terms and
conditions, which would justify the action taken by the
appellant/ APIIC in issuing Ex.B.12 letter of cancellation.
Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that the agreement
Ex.A.1/ B.5 was cancelled rightly by the appellant/APIIC.
</p><p id="p_53">     The second question that arises for consideration is-
whether Ex.A.8/B.19 is a fresh offer or is the agreement
dated 19.12.1976 continued? Ex.A.8 is a letter dated
10.08.1983 in which the appellant as pointed out certain
breaches and said that there is a violation of various
clauses.  There is a reference to Ex.B.17/18-letter dated
09.03.1981 and the reply thereof dated 03.04.1981.
</p>
<p id="p_54">     In Ex.B.17-letter dated 09.03.1981 the appellant
clearly specifies that in case of the first respondent is
interested in re-allotment of the land already cancelled,
the same can be re-allotted at a cost of Rs.13/- per
square yard.  The first respondent was requested to give
their consent. The reply dated 03.04.1991 states that the
issue would have brought to the notice of the concerned
person who was not available readily. There was a lot of
correspondence on these issues, as can be seen from 
Ex.A.18.  Clauses-4 and 5 of Ex.A.8 are as follows:
</p><p id="p_55">4. However, to settle this long pending and vexatious
issue and enable you to secure the SFC loan it has
been finally decided to consider restoration of
allotment by charging. Rs.13/- per square yard as
indicated by you earlier.  However, restoration will be
conditional upon your paying 50% land cost at
Rs.13/- per square yard less the amount already paid
within fifteen days of the receipt of the letter and
balance 50% cost within six months thereafter at
usual interest rates.
</p>
<p id="p_56">5. Your willingness or otherwise should be
communicated to us within ten days from the date of
receipt of the letter.  A copy of this letter is being sent
to the Andhra Pradesh State Financial Corporation
also.  It may also be noted that the above decision is
final and irrevocable.
</p>
<p id="p_57">     The restoration was conditional as can be seen from
clauses-4 and 5. The time of 15 days was given for
payment of the balance sale consideration and the
balance 50% cost within six months.  The willingness
was also requested to be communicated within 15 days  
from the date of receipt of the said letter. A plain
language interpretation of this letter shows that a
decision was taken to restore the allotment on two
conditions. Restoration also clearly implies a prior
cancellation and the undoing of what was done.  It clearly
implies an action of returning something to a former
condition.  The reply to Ex.B.8 is Ex.A.9.  The offer made
Ex.A.8 was not accepted by the first respondent.  They
agreed to pay the balance 50% of the cost in the names of
three different companies.  The payment of 50% of the
land cost within 15 day as stipulated in Ex.A.8 was also
not done.  In fact, as per the respondent, Ex.A.8 was
delivered in November 1984 only.  Even if 15 days is
reckoned from this date, it is clear that the payment
made under Ex.A.11 is way beyond the 15 days period  
stipulated.  Ex.A.11 is dated 04.12.1985 and even the
date of cheque is 04.02.1985. The payment, which 
should have been effected in early December 1984 after
the receipt of Ex.A.8, was made only in early February
1985.  The cheque was also returned by the appellants
letter dated 26.02.1985 under Ex.A.12. The subsequent
cheque from another third party which was sent, vide
Ex.A.13 was also returned on 23.03.1985 by Ex.A.14. 
Therefore, the letters filed by the plaintiff/first
respondent himself clearly shows that there was a
negotiation for re-allotment of the land.  The same was
also conditional. The conditions were not met. It is settled
law that an offer should be accepted as stipulated and
must be absolute.  <a href="/doc/74115/" id="a_2">Section 7</a> of the Indian Contract that
clearly states that a proposal can be offered into an
acceptance if a) the acceptance is absolute and
unqualified; b) if the proposal prescribes the manner in
which it is to be accepted and the acceptance was made 
in such manner, the proposes may insist that the
proposal should be accepted in the prescribed manner
and not otherwise.
</p><p id="p_58">     In the case on hand, the offer of the re-allotment
stated that it would be restored on payment of 50% of the
land costs at Rs.13/- per square yard only within 15
days from the date of receipt of the letter.  In addition,
the willingness was also to be communicated within 10
days from the date of receipt of the letter.  In the case on
hand, it is clear that even if the delivery of the letter was
only on 22.11.1984, the acceptance is not in terms of
<a href="/doc/74115/" id="a_3">Section 7</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_4">Contract Act</a>. Immediately after letter
dated 28.11.1984 Ex.A.9 was sent. In addition,
subsequent correspondence also discloses that the 
amounts were refunded vide Exs.A.12 and A.14 on the 
ground that the requirements mentioned in the letter
dated 10.08.1983 (Ex.A.8) were not fulfilled.
</p>
<p id="p_59">     Therefore, on a review of the facts and after
considering the submissions made by both the learned 
counsel, this Court is of the opinion that the proposal
under Ex.A.8 is a fresh proposal for restoration of the
earlier allotment that was cancelled on 19.12.1977. It
was conditional and the first respondent did not fulfil the
conditions stipulated.  Therefore, it is clear that there is
no consensus ad idem between the parties.  The terms 
which are stipulated were not adhered to.  In this view of
the matter, this Court answers the points framed for
consideration as follows:
</p><p id="p_60">a)      There is a breach of terms and conditions of
Ex.A.1/B.15 by the first respondent.
</p><p id="p_61">b)      The revocation by letter dated 09.12.1977
(Ex.B.12) is correct.
</p><p id="p_62">c)      Ex.A.8/B.19 is a fresh offer for allotment of
the land at a new rate.  The same was not
accepted within the time.
</p><p id="p_63">d)      This Court holds that there is no acceptance
of the proposal nor is there any consensus
ad idem amongst the parties, which would 
lead to a conclusion that there is an
acceptance of Ex.A.8 proposal.
</p>
<p id="p_64">        The next point that survives for consideration is the
relief claimed in OS No.267 of 1993; wherein specific
performance of Ex.A.1/B.5 agreement of sale is sought
for.
</p><p id="p_65">        It is the contention of the learned counsel for the
appellant that Ex.A.1 agreement was already revoked and 
cancelled.  He points out various letters addressed by the
first respondent wherein they sought for revocation of
the proposals. The offer dated 10.08.1983 in Ex.A.8 is an
offer for revocation proposals on certain conditions.
These conditions were not fulfilled. The reply of the
learned senior counsel is that the cancellation itself is
wrong and that the APIIC never acted in time or
seriously.  Even the alleged letter of cancellation was
delivered one year later.  This Court notices that even if
the same is correct, the failure of the respondent to
comply with the conditions is clear. Therefore, this Court
holds that the earlier agreement of 19.12.1976 was not
restored in order to enable the first respondent to seek
specific performance of the same in OS No.267 of 1993.
</p>        
<p id="p_66">     In addition, it is the contention of the learned
counsel for the appellants that the claim is hopelessly
barred by time. The learned counsel for the appellants
submits that the termination dated 19.12.1977 under
Ex.B.12 has put an end to the contract dated
19.12.1976. The subsequent offer made on 10.08.1983 
vide Ex.A.8/B.19 was also not accepted in time.
Therefore, the learned counsel contends that the suit
which is filed on 23.10.1986 is hopelessly barred by time.
This Court held that the offer dated 10.08.1983 does not
in any way restore Ex.A.1 agreement. The learned senior
counsel appearing for the respondents states that the
letter dated 10.08.1983 was only received in November
1984 (Ex.A.9) and that the cheques submitted by the first
respondent was returned, vide Ex.A.12 dated
26.02.1985.  Therefore, the learned counsel argues that
the plaint in OS No.267 of 1993 which is presented on
23.10.1986 is within time.  He states that the limitation
under <a href="/doc/887242/" id="a_5">Article 54</a> of he <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_6">Limitation Act</a> commences from
the date of refusal of the specific performance and the
suit that is filed within three years is within time.  He
therefore argues that the findings of the lower Court on
issue No.1 that the suit is not time barred is correct.
</p>        
<p id="p_67">     In reply to this, the learned counsel for the
appellants argued that the cancellation of the agreement
of sale was in December 1977.  Thereafter, there was
only correspondence about the revoking the said
proposal.  He rightly points out that once time begins to
run; it does not stop. He submits that the fresh offer
which did not culminate into an acceptance cannot be
used to save time. Therefore, the limitation cannot be
reckoned from the date of the new offer.  The cancellation
of the allotment in 1977 should have been challenged
within three years therefrom and failure of the first
respondent to bring any action for enforcement of Ex.A.1
or to challenge the termination within three years debars
them from claiming any relief on the basis of Ex.A.1. This
Court also finds that issue No.1 that is framed in this
suit was incorrectly decided.  In the opinion of this Court,
the suit is hopelessly barred by time.
</p>
<p id="p_68">     Even issue No.2 in OS No.267 of 1993 is wrongly
decided in the opinion of this Court.  The agreement was
terminated rightly. Even if time is not the essence of the
contract in case of sale of urban immovable properties,
still failure of the first respondent to adhere all the terms
and conditions of the allotment within a reasonable gives
the right to the appellants to cancel the agreement.  Time
may not be the essence of the contract for the specific
performance of the urban properties. But the conditions
of allotment which are specified cannot be overlooked.
The correspondence and contemporaneous    
understanding of the parties is also to the effect that the
first respondent failed to commence the construction and
complete the same.  Hence, this Court holds that the
contract is not in force any more.
</p><p id="p_69">        Issue No.3 is whether the plaintiff is entitled for
specific performance.  This Court has already held that if
the agreement is not in force, it is not capable of being
specifically enforced. This Court also held that the claim
is barred by time.
</p><p id="p_70">     In addition, this Court also notices that the
continuous readiness and willingness which is required
of the first respondent is not proved. In a number of
cases, the Honble Supreme Court of India held that they
should be continuous readiness and willingness for the
enforcement of the contract. Readiness has been
interpreted as being ready with the money or having the
necessary financial resources to complete the
transaction. Willingness has been interpreted showing
the eagerness to get the contract completed, as per the
decision of Honble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/169428/" id="a_7">N.P. Thirugnanam v.
Dr. R. Jagan Mohan Rao</a>  and other cases. In this case,
Ex.A.1 agreement contemplated payment of the balance  
cost within six months from the date of Ex.A.1 i.e., six
months from 09.12.1976.  There is absolutely nothing in
the evidence to show that this was complied with.  Even
Ex.A.6 letter shows that the cheques were issued for the
balance costs from third parties, but the same were
returned without considering the request for revocation.
Even letter of revocation Ex.B.12-letter dated 19.12.1977
clearly speaks of the failure to pay the balance amount
and also to start the factory work. In addition, after the
offer was made to reallot the land at Rs.13/- per square
yard and to revoke the allocation also, the first
respondent did not pay the money in time. The cheques 
were not paid/tendered as stipulated. The continuous
readiness is therefore not proved.      
</p>
<p id="p_71">     Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that neither
the readiness nor the willingness which are necessary for
granting a decree of specific performance are pleaded or
proved in this case.  Therefore, this Court holds that the
plaintiff is not entitled to specific performance of the
agreement of sale.  Issue No.3 is therefore, held against
the plaintiff.  As a consequence the plaintiff in OS No.267
of 1993, the first respondent herein is entitled to any
relief. In fact, in the case of Andhra Pradesh Indl.
<a href="/doc/182347528/" id="a_8">Infrastructural Corporation Ltd. v. Shivani Engineering
Industries</a> , similar clauses of allotment were upheld.
The present appellant is the appellant before the Honble
Supreme Court of India. The conduct of APIIC (present
appellant) in not canceling the allotment and resuming
the plot was commented upon strongly by the Honble 
Supreme Court. 
</p><p id="p_72">     In view of the discussion made earlier, the following
are the findings in respect of the issues that are framed
in OS No.151 of 1987.
</p><p id="p_73">i)        the first issue whether the agreement of sale
dated 15.11.1987 is valid and binding on the
defendant. The lower Court rightly held that
the agreement dated 09.12.1976 is valid and
binding.
</p><p id="p_74">ii)       Issue No.2 is to the effect whether the leasing
of the property to defendants 2 to 10 is
contrary and illegal. Defendants 2 to 10 are
not contesting the suits. Ex.A.1 agreement
clearly states that the land cannot be
transferred or conveyed to other parties
within 10 years. Similarly, the first
respondent undertook not to assign,
underlet, sublet or part with the possession
of the land or in part thereof without
obtaining the written consent of the
appellant/APIIC. It was argued during the
course of submissions that the said clause
applies to the land only based on the
admission of the witness for the respondent
(DW.1). 
</p><p id="p_75">     It is the argument of the learned counsel for the
respondents that as the witness himself admitted this,
the sheds can be leased and there is no mistake
committed by the lower Court.
</p><p id="p_76">     This Court, however, notices that an overall
interpretation of the terms and conditions of the contract
shows that the land was allotted for a specific purpose
namely to establish a factory in the same. The first
respondent failed to establish and start production as
required under Ex.A.1. He leased out the sheds which
were constructed therein. In the oral evidence of PW.1, he
states that his son leased out a shed that is constructed
thereon. Even in his cross-examination on 07.11.1999,
PW.1 clearly admitted as I have let out the
infrastructure through my family members to third
parties.  Similarly, a specific question was put in the
further cross-examination stating that Jwalamukhi
Packaging Industry is paying Rs.14,000/- per month
towards the rent.  The witness adds that the industry
agreed to pay, but did not pay such amount. The said
industry is not the tenant of PW.1, but it was let out
through his son.  He further agrees that because his son
contributes some funds, he leased out the sheds.  The
witness also admitted that he has got proof to show that
he raised loans from some third parties. Therefore, the
evidence on record clearly shows that the property and
the sheds therein were leased out. In para-9 of the plaint,
the appellant herein has clearly spelt out the details of
the rent being received in respect of four tenants viz.,
defendants 1 to 4 with regard to the period of lease and
the amounts are specified. There is no denial of these
facts and figures by the first respondent.  In reply to this
para-9 of the written statement, on the contrary, first
defendant admits that he has leased out the portion so
constructed to recover some amounts spent by first
defendants infrastructure. There is no proof filed to show
that the defendant borrowed any money from others.
In addition, no documentary proof is filed to show that
only the shed/superstructure and not the land was
leased to defendants 2 to 10 in this suit.
</p>
<p id="p_77">     In the light of this available evidence, this Court is
of the opinion that the lower Court committed an error in
failing to correctly decide issue No.2. The available
evidence and the failure of the defendants to reply to the
same in his written statement should have prompted the
lower Court to award the damages, mesne profits as
claimed. The lower Court committed an error in stating
that the advocate commissioner was not appointed to
decide the fact. The lower Court over looked the
admissions in the written statement and in the oral
evidence. If the land itself cannot be sublet or rented out
the super structure constructed on the land (more so
after the cancellation of allotment) cannot also be sublet
or transferred.  What cannot be done directly cannot be
done indirectly. Therefore, this Court holds that the
leasing of the property by the first defendant to
defendants 2 to 10 is contrary to the agreed terms and
that the plaintiffs are entitled to mesne profits as prayed
for. Therefore, issue Nos.2 and 4 are decided in favour of
the plaintiffs. There shall be a decree for the sum of
Rs.3,88,080/- as prayed for in the suit.
</p><p id="p_78">     In view of the non-denial and the admissions in the
oral evidence, the decree is passed for the said sum of
Rs.4,88,080/- with interest at 18%.  Permission is also
accorded to the plaintiff/appellant to file an appropriate
application for determination of future mesne profits.
</p>
<p id="p_79">     In view of the fact that the terms and conditions of
Ex.A.1 were violated and as the suit for specific
performance is also dismissed, this Court is of the
opinion that issue No.3 is also to be decided in favour of
the appellant and against the first respondent. The
plaintiff/appellant is entitled to possession of the
property.  Respondents 2 to 10 are directed to hand over
the vacant peaceful possession to the appellant within a
period of two months from the date of receipt of a copy of
this order.  Hence, this Court is of the opinion that the
appeal AS No.998 of 1995 is to be allowed. Tr.AS
No.3464 of 2003 is also to be allowed while the Cross
Appeal filed by the defendant/ first respondent is to be
dismissed. 
</p>
<p id="p_80">     Accordingly, AS No.998 of 1995 and Tr.AS No.3464
of 2003 are allowed and Cross-appeal in Tr.AS No.3464
of 2003 are dismissed. In the circumstances, there shall
be no order as to costs.
</p><p id="p_81">        Miscellaneous Petitions, if any, pending in this
appeal shall stand closed.
