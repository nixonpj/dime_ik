                    factual findings recorded by the learned trial

                    Judge, according to us, there is no merit in

                    the        appeal    filed             by       the        appellant-State

                    because the investigation of the case against

                    the accused was undertaken by one Police Sub-

                    Inspector         and      it         is    difficult             for        us       to

                    accept, looking to the papers of investigation

                    that it was done by a Dy.S.P. Considering the

                    scheme of <a href="/doc/70738471/" id="a_6">Section 17</a> of the Act read with Rule

                    7     of    the   Rules         framed          under        the       Act,          the

                    investigation was required to be carried out

                    by    the     Dy.S.P.         and      that         too      designated               to

                    investigate         the        crime         Registered              under           the

                    Atrocity Act. This Court has held that the

                    relevant Rule (7) of the Atrocity Rules is a

                    mandate and non-compliance of the same would

                    go to the root of the validity and fairness of

                    the investigation. Either party can claim that

                    the investigation by an officer below the rank

                    of Dy.S.P. has resulted into prejudice to him

                    and on this sole count, the accused could have

                    been       acquitted.           It         is     also        relevant               and

                    rightly said by the learned trial Judge that

          CR.A/1656/2005                           4/7                                               ORDER



                    though       the     alleged          incident             is       of          26th

                    November, 1995, the complaint has been filed

                    on 29th November, 1995; and the prosecution was

                    under    obligation           to      explain          the        delay          in

                    filing the FIR. When there are allegations by

                    the defence's side that the complaint has been

                    concocted          for      ulterior            motive            and           for

                    particular         reason,          then     the        learned           trial

                    Judge was supposed to ascertain whether the

                    delay in filing the FIR goes to the root of

                    the   case    of     the      prosecution.              So     we      are       in

                    agreement that non-explanation of delay caused

                    in    such    a    situation          would         go       against            the

                    prosecution.         During           the        course           of        oral

                    submissions, in response to the query raised

                    by    the     Court,         learned           Additional               Public

                    Prosecutor Mr.Dave has fairly accepted that no

                    corroborative piece of evidence in the nature

                    of medical evidence is available on record.

                    This also would go against the prosecution so

                    far as the allegation of assault/beating is

                    concerned.</p><pre id="pre_2">

</pre><p id="p_6">            4.      The learned trial Judge was under obligation

                    to ascertain whether the prosecution has led

                    satisfactory evidence on the point that the

                    complainant/victim            is     a      member          of       either

                    Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe.                               In more

                    than one decision, this Court has said that as

                    per the Rule of best evidence, the prosecution

                    should    produce     the      caste          certificate.                   The

                    personal knowledge of any individual including

                    the Presiding Judge cannot take shape proof or

                    evidence. The learned trial Judge ought not

                    have recorded the finding in affirmative that

                    the    prosecution    has      proved           the      fact        beyond

                    doubt that the alleged victim is a member of

                    Scheduled    Caste.      Considering               the       nature           of

                    evidence led on this point by the prosecution,

                    the trial Court could not have convicted the

                    accused for the offence punishable under the

                    Judicial       Magistrate                First          Class          on          29th

                    November, 1995 would not make the complaint

                    bad and doubtful because the allegation in the

                    complaint      is    that          the      alleged          incident              has

                    occurred       on     26th         November,             1995         and          the

                    complaint is filed on 29th November, 1995. We

                    also would like to clarify that the refusal of

                    leave to appeal shall not come in the way in

                    dealing       with     the         appeal         preferred              by        the

                    respondent-accused on its own merits and that

                    appeal obviously shall have to be decided on

                    its own merits in accordance with law and the

                    same    shall       not    cause          any       prejudice            to        any

                    party.       The Registry shall send the papers of

                    Criminal       Appeal         No.719             of       2005          to         the

                    concerned Bench at the earliest.</p><pre id="pre_3">
