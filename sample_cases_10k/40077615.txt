                                     JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.                 This is a regular appeal u/s 96 of CPC filed by the
defendant in trial court who seeks setting aside the judgment and
decree in Suit no. 8314/16 dated 16.12.2016 on the files of Ld.
ASCJ/GJ, Shahdara, Delhi. The LD. Court below had decreed the
suit directing the defendant to quit and deliver the vacant possession
in respect of premises no. 53A, Parvana Road, Jitar Nagar, Delhi-51
and also directed him to pay the arrears of rent @ Rs.3,000/- per
month from October, 2011 till August, 2014 and thereafter @



Nasim Akhtar vs. Shahnawaz &amp; Anr.         RCA No.60/17             Page 1/12
 Rs.4,000/- per month till November, 2014 and @ Rs.8,000/- per
month till he hands over the possession along with interest @ 6%
per annum on the arrears.
</p>
<p id="p_2">Brief facts before the trial court :
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.                 The plaintiffs in the trial court (the respondents herein)
have filed a suit for possession and recovery of rents and damages
against this appellant. It is contended that the premises was let out
consisting of two rooms in the ground floor @ Rs.4,000/- per month
under oral tenancy for 11 months. The same was extended upon
mutual consent with an enhanced rate of Rs.5,000/- per month.
Defendant paid the rents upto December, 2009. Thereafter stopped.
The plaintiff no.2 demanded the rent arrears on 22.6.2014 but the
tenant -defendant created a scene which resulted in a complaint with
PS Jagatpuri in DD No. 21B. The total arrears is Rs.2,84,000/-. The
defendant is in unauthorized occupation and is liable to pay
Rs.12,000/- per month as mesne profits. The cause of action arose
on 22.6.2014. The suit property is within the jurisdiction of this court
and sufficient court fee is paid. Therefore, the prayer is for recovery
of possession and also the arrears of rent.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.                 The defendant contended that the suit is filed only to
harass him and the true facts are suppressed. The suit is barred u/s
15 of the <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_1">Delhi Rent Control Act</a> since the rate of rent is Rs.850/- per
month excluding electricity and water charges at the time of inception
and the rate of rent admitted is Rs.1,000/- per month as on the date
of litigation and that the landlord had forged and fabricated the rent
receipts. A sum of Rs.1.5 lacs was received by the landlord as



Nasim Akhtar vs. Shahnawaz &amp; Anr.    RCA No.60/17                   Page 2/12
 security deposit. Rents were paid upto August, 2014. On 24.8.2014
the defendants came to the suit property to forcibly evict. Later since
the refundable deposit amount was with the landlords, they agreed to
allow the defendant for an unlimited period. However, there was a
threat by the landlords. The defendant had moved the civil court for
injunction. All the other allegations made in the plaint are denied.
</p>
<p id="p_5">Issues before the trial court :
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.                 Based on the pleadings, the trial court had framed five
issues as under :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree for recovery
                  of possession of the suit premises bearing No. 53-A,
                  Parwana Road, Opp. Deepak Nursing Home, Jitar
                  Nagar, Delhi-51 in favour of the plaintiff and against the
                  defendant, as prayed for? OPP

                  01.01.2010 till 30.09.014 i.e. Rs.2,85,000/- in favour of
                  the plaintiff and against the defendant, as prayed for?</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">                  OPP

</p><p id="p_8">             3. Whether the plaintiff is entitled for pendentelite and
                  future interest, if so at what rate? OPP

</p><p id="p_9">             4. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree for recovery
                  of mesne profits/damages @ Rs.12,000/- per month




Nasim Akhtar vs. Shahnawaz &amp; Anr.    RCA No.60/17                  Page 3/12
                   from w.e.f. 01.10.2014 in favour of the plaintiff and
                  against the defendant, as prayed? OPP

</p><p id="p_10">             5. Relief.
</p>
<p id="p_11">5.                 After the parties have adduced evidence i.e. two
witnesses on behalf of the plaintiff and three witnesses on behalf of
the defence, the court has come to a conclusion that the plaintiff is
entitled for a relief of possession in respect of the property and had
further decreed the suit by ordering the payment of mesne profits.
Aggrieved by the said judgment and decree, the present appeal is
filed on the following :
</p>
<p id="p_12">Grounds :
</p>
<p id="p_13">(1)                The suit was not maintainable in view of the bar under
<a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_2">Delhi Rent Control Act</a> and the judgment impugned suffers from want
of jurisdiction since the rent was Rs.850/-. There was no mandatory
legal notice. There is no evidence to conclude that the rate of rent is
Rs.4,000/- per month. The damages awarded is not based on any
sound evidence.          The date of commencement of tenancy is not
pleaded and the respondent no.2 herein has no title or ownership.
There was no cause of action and that the entire judgment is based
upon conjectures and surmises.
</p>
<p id="p_14">6.                 Notices were ordered on this appeal and that
respondents appeared through their counsel. The trial court records
are summoned. Perused the same. Heard the ld. Counsel on either
side. The counsel for appellant submits that there is no basis for the
impugned judgment to be sustained on record. It was argued that



Nasim Akhtar vs. Shahnawaz &amp; Anr.   RCA No.60/17                Page 4/12
 appellant had paid a refundable deposit of 1.5 lacs to one Hazi Ali,
the respondent no.2. Ex.PW1/3 much relied by the plaintiff in the
trial court is not a dependable document since the same is vague
and sham.         The landlords were not in the habit of issuing rent
receipts and therefore the rate of rent never came to be proved. The
evidence adduced on behalf of the defendants was more credit
worthy.      DW-2 and DW-3 are independent witnesses and their
evidence was not properly appreciated.
</p>
<p id="p_15">7.                 On the other hand the respondents had submitted
written arguments through their counsel. It is contended that the
ownership can never be an issue. As regards the aspect of rent
receipts, it is contended that the appellant had made different
signatures in the pleadings, documents and statement. The ld. Court
below had noted that no question was put to PW-1 regarding the rent
receipt not bearing the signatures of the defendant.          Even the
evidence of DW-1 is short and there is no say by DW-1 to dispute
Ex.PW1/3.        There is no document rebutting the Ex.PW1/3.       The
electricity and water charges of Rs.70,000/- remains unpaid by the
tenant. The plaintiffs relied on several rulings as under :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (a)          <a href="/doc/183635/" id="a_3">Ramrameshwari Devi vs. Nirmala Devi &amp; Ors</a>.
      (2011) 8 SCC 249 to urge that wrong doers if ultimately evicted
      after a long time, they are not generally adequately punished
      and the steps should be taken to impose actual, realistic and
      proper costs.</blockquote>

       questioning the ownership of the suit property and that when the
      rent agreement is admitted where the rent is Rs.4,500/-, the
      DRC Act will not come into play.

      thereby a secured creditor.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                   On the basis of above arguments, Ld. Counsel for the
respondents prays for the dismissal of the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_19">Issues in this appeal :
</p>
<p id="p_20">8.                 After listening to the Ld. Counsel on either side and
after perusal of the trial court records, the following issue arises in
this appeal :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "Whether the impugned judgment and decree passed
      by the ld. Court below is suffering from perversity,
      illegality and impropriety or not and if in the
      affirmative, what relief?"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">Answers to the issue :
</p>
<p id="p_22">9.                 The relationship of landlord and tenant is not at all in
dispute since the defendant in the trial court contended that the
monthly rent is Rs.850/-.           Plaintiff contended that initially the rent



Nasim Akhtar vs. Shahnawaz &amp; Anr.      RCA No.60/17                   Page 6/12
 was Rs.4,000/- and the same was increased to Rs.5,000/- in the year
2004. The last rent paid was in the year 2009.              In order to prove
these facts, the plaintiff examined two witnesses i.e. PW-1 Hazi Ali
and PW-2 Rizwan.            PW-1 had filed his affidavit at Ex.PW1/A. The
date of induction of the defendant as a tenant @ Rs.4,000/- per
month is not mentioned. However, it is testified in the trial court that
the tenancy was extended and defendant agreed to pay Rs.5,000/-
per month. Even the date of this extension of tenancy is not pleaded
nor sworn to in the affidavit Ex.PW1/A.             However, in order to show
that the current rent, Ex.PW1/3 is produced by this witness Hazi Ali.
It is elicited in the cross-examination that there was no rent
agreement. He also admits that the enhancement of rent is also not
in writing.
</p>
<p id="p_23">10.                The documentary evidence at Ex.PW1/3 is perused.
This document is issued for the period from 1.3.2004 to 30.4.2004.
This is for a period of two months and the rate of rent is Rs.4,000/-
per month. This is bearing date 5.3.2004.
</p>
<p id="p_24">11.                Except the above document, there is no initial rent
agreement nor the enhanced rent agreement in the year of 2009.
After perusal of the above document, the same does not bear the
signature of the landlord. Ex.PW1/3 which is the alleged rent receipt,
contains the signatures of tenant only i.e. Nasim Akhtar. Moreover,
the rent receipt is dated 5.3.2004. The period of rent is for 1.3.2004
to 30.4.2004. This aspect of payment of rent in advance for a period
of two months throw doubt on the veracity of this document. No
tenant would pay advance rents to any landlord. The contents of the




Nasim Akhtar vs. Shahnawaz &amp; Anr.    RCA No.60/17                    Page 7/12
 document would show that the tenant had paid the advance rent on
5.3.2004 amounting to Rs.8,000/- for a period of two months ending
by 30.4.2004.         Thus, there is a doubt which lingers on the very
document for the following two reasons :
</p>
<p id="p_25">(a)   That the rent receipt does not contain the signatures of the
landlord but has the signature of the tenant only.         Normally the
person who issues receipt acknowledges the payment by subscribing
his signatures to such document. Strangely, the recipient did not
sign but contains the signatures of the tenant only.      Therefore, this
document leads to doubt its credibility and is not reliable.
</p>
<p id="p_26">(b)    Secondly, this being an advance payment of rent for a period of
two months ending by 30.4.2004. The rents were paid according to
Ex.PW1/3 on 5.3.2004. No prudent tenant would pay the advance
sum of rents unless and until a request is made by the landlord.
There is no pleading by the landlord that the tenant had paid the
advance rents. What is pleaded at Para 2 regarding this document is
that "later on also took a rent receipt in March 2004 for the purpose
of voter I-Card, etc.".
</p>
<p id="p_27">12.                In the above context of rent receipt projecting doubts
by the very document produced by the plaintiff, the other evidence is
perused. PW-2, who is not a summoned witness, by name Rizwan is
also not helpful to corroborate the rate of rent and the execution of
the receipt.       He only testified that the defendant paid rents @
Rs.4,000/- few times in his presence and few times @ Rs.5,000/- per
month in the year 2008-09. No doubt, in the cross-examination of
PW-1 and PW-2, nothing is elicited to demolish the above document



Nasim Akhtar vs. Shahnawaz &amp; Anr.   RCA No.60/17                Page 8/12
 Ex.PW1/3 on the above lines. Even if there is no cross-examination,
a duty is cast upon the court to verify, examine and test the
document in the backdrop of pleadings, test the very appearance of
the document as regards the credit-worthiness of such document in
the eyes of law as well as in the book of common prudence.
</p>
<p id="p_28">13.                The evidence of tenant i.e. DW-1, it is seen that in the
cross-examination by the landlord himself, the tenant had denied the
suggestion that the landlord had issued the rent receipt of Rs.4,000/-.
DW-1 volunteered to say that "no rent receipt was given to me by
the plaintiff." The rent receipt at Ex.PW1/3 is not confronted to the
tenant by the landlord atleast to have elicited his views on the rent
receipt. The ld. Court below had also noted that the evidence of PW-
2 is not worth of proving the enhancement of rent at para 19 of the
judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_29">14.                Therefore, the rate of rent at Rs.4,000/- per month is
not proved on record since the only documentary evidence at
Ex.PW1/3 is clouded under doubts.             The Ld. Court below in its
impugned judgment had not discussed on the document at
Ex.PW1/3 except stating that tenant had not put up any suggestion
to the witness PW-1 as regards the said document being forged and
fabricated and not containing the signatures of the landlord. Suffice it
to say that the very document is shrouded in many unanswered
doubts, cannot be held as the basis to hold that the rate of rent is
Rs.4,000/- per month. Therefore, the issue no.2 framed before the
Ld. Court below regarding the arrears of rent amounting to




Nasim Akhtar vs. Shahnawaz &amp; Anr.   RCA No.60/17                  Page 9/12
 Rs.2,85,000/- is not sustainable in law being the arrears of rent for
the period 1.1.2010 to 30.09.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_30">15.                The ld. Counsel Sh. Rajeev Gupta appearing for the
respondents had strenuously argued that after obtaining the ex-parte
stay, the appellant did not comply the orders of the court in
depositing the rents and the arrears being Rs.3,57,000/- unpaid is
not entitled for any relief in the appeal. This contention is beyond
comprehension since the rate of rent itself is not properly
adjudicated.
</p>
<p id="p_31">16.                It is argued by the landlords in this appeal that on the
issuance of rent receipt is conclusive. The same cannot be accepted
since the reliability of the rent receipt is shrouded in mystery. The
landlord alleges that the tenant made different signatures in the
pleadings, documents and statements to mislead the court of law.
The mere non-pleading by the tenant with regard to the receipts and
the non-taking of a defence that it is forged would not cure the
illegality and the non-reliability of the very receipt for the two major
reasons mentioned above.
</p>
<p id="p_32">17.                Thus it is to be noted that the impugned judgment
which had simply believed the rate of rent as Rs.4,000/- per month
based on the receipt at Ex.PW1/3 cannot be held to be proper and
therefore, the arrears of rent calculated at the above said rate cannot
be enforced. Thus, the first part of the issue is answered in the
affirmative.
</p>



<p id="p_33">Nasim Akhtar vs. Shahnawaz &amp; Anr.   RCA No.60/17                  Page 10/12
</p><p id="p_34"> 18.                While framing the issues in this appeal, this court is
also bound to answer the consequences.             Having held that the
impugned judgment is improper and having been rendered on a
documentary evidence at Ex.PW1/3 which is unreliable under Law,
the consequences and the entitlement of the parties with regard to
the relief is to be also answered.
</p>
<p id="p_35">19.                As noted above, the appellant has admitted that he is
the tenant. He cannot question the ownership of the landlords.
Tenant had also placed any reliable evidence to show that the rate of
rent is below Rs.3,000/- per month so that the jurisdiction of the civil
court is not attracted.
</p>
<p id="p_36">20.                In the above context, the matter requires proper
adjudication of rent by the court below by discarding the
documentary evidence placed by the landlords and at the same time,
the tenant having not placed any documents to show the rate of rent
as pleaded in his written statement in the court below.             In this
context, it is expected that the court below has to conduct an enquiry
to find the applicable market rate of rent in the area.           For this
purpose, the location of the property, the availability of facilities in the
demised premises, the nature of construction, flooring, the fetching of
rents of like properties in the area, the extent of the demised
premises are to be looked into. Therefore, the parties have to lead
separate and independent evidence to establish their respective
contentions. Upon the reception of such evidence, the court below
would arrive independently to give its verdict on the reasonable rent
as on the date of filing of the suit, which would also determine the

 jurisdiction of the court.          Therefore, the matter requires further
enquiry on this aspect and the issues are to be re-visited thereafter.
In the peculiar circumstances, this court has no other option than to
remand back the matter to the trial court.            Hence, the following
order :
