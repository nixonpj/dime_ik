       whose evidence has been adopted by petitioner in this case has 

       also   been   decided   with   common   judgment  Jai   Singh   Vs.   UOI. 

       Since petitioner has led no different evidence as led in  Zile Singh 

       case, therefore, I do not find any ground to go differently then what 

       Hon'ble Justice has held. Therefore, I held that petitioner would be 

       entitled to market value @ Rs.18,47,539.68 per acre for category 'C' 

       land as determined in Jai Singh case.
