B.P. SINGH, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">	These appeals by special leave are directed against the common 
judgment and order of the Gauhati High Court dated 21st July, 2003 in Writ 
Petition (C) No. 6541 of 2001 [WP (C) No.221(SH)/2002] and Writ Petition 
(C) No. 6542 of 2001 [WP (C) No.222(SH)/2002] whereby the High Court 
dismissed the writ petitions filed by the appellants herein.  
</p>
<p id="p_3">	Appellant Ewanlangki-e Rymbai, a Christian by faith is a Member of 
the Jaintia Scheduled Tribe.  The other appellant, namely  Elaka Jowai 
Secular Movement is represented by its Vice Chairman and Executive 
Member.  In both the writ petitions the constitutional validity of Section 3 of 
the United Khasi Jaintia Hills Autonomous District (Appointment and 
Succession of Chiefs and Headmen) Act, 1959 (hereinafter referred to as 
'the Act of 1959') has been challenged.  The writ petitions also challenged 
the notice dated August 28, 2001 issued by the Jaintia Hills Autonomous 
District Council, Jowai declaring the programme for the election of Dolloi in 
the Elaka Jowai and also the notice dated September 4, 2001 issued by the 
Secretary, Executive Committee, Jaintia Hills Autonomous District Council, 
Jowai.  
</p>
<p id="p_4">Section 3 of the Act of 1959 provides that subject to the provisions of 
the Act and the Rules made thereunder all elections and appointments of 
Chiefs and Headmen shall be in accordance with the existing customs 
prevailing in the Elaka concerned.  The notice dated September 4, 2001 
announced the programme for the conduct of election for Dolloi in the Elaka 
Jowai but the notice issued by the Secretary on behalf of the Executive 
Committee, Jaintia Hills Autonomous District Council, Jowai provided that 
only the members of the clans mentioned therein could contest the aforesaid 
election and thereby the persons belonging to the Christian faith were 
excluded from contesting the said election.  The appellants contend that 
exclusion of Christians from contesting the election is in violation of 
Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India since they are excluded 
only on the ground of religion.  They further contend that Section 3 of the 
Act of 1959 which provided that the appointment of the Chiefs or Headmen 
shall be in accordance with the existing customs prevailing in the Elaka 
concerned, is also bad.  It gives legal sanctity to a customs which itself is in 
breach of Articles 14 to 16 of the Constitution of India.  In sum and sub 
stance the appellants contend that exclusion of Christians from contesting 
election for the post of Dolloi in Elaka Jowai is discriminatory and in breach 
of Articles 14 to 16 of the Constitution of India since their exclusion is 
merely on the ground of religion. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">We may notice at the threshold that Jowai District is an autonomous  
District to which  the provisions of Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of 
India apply in view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1624304/" id="a_1">Article 244(2)</a> of the Constitution of 
India.  The brief historical background in which the aforesaid autonomous 
district was created may be noticed at this stage :-
</p>
<p id="p_6">On coming into force of the Constitution of India the United Khasi-
Jaintia Hills District was formed as one of the Tribal Areas of Assam by 
merging the Khasi States with the other areas of the Khasi-Jaintia Hills, 
boundaries whereof were defined by para 20(2) of the Sixth Schedule to the 
Constitution (hereinafter referred to as 'the Schedule').  Under para 2(4) of 
the Schedule, the administration of the aforesaid district vested in the 
District Council which was clothed with administrative and judicial powers.  
In view of the demand for creation of an autonomous District comprising the 
Jowai sub-division of the aforesaid District, the Governor of Assam 
appointed a Commission to look into the matter and make its 
recommendation.  The report of the Commission was placed before the 
Legislative Assembly which approved the action proposed to be taken 
pursuant to the report.  Consequently on November 23, 1964 a Notification 
was issued by the Governor of Assam creating a new autonomous District 
Council for the Jowai Sub-Division by excluding Jowai Sub-division from 
the United Khasi-Jaintia Hills Autonomous District with effect from 
December 1, 1964.  Thus the Jowai District came into existence as an 
autonomous District with effect from December 1, 1964. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">As earlier noticed <a href="/doc/1624304/" id="a_2">Article 244(2)</a> of the Constitution provides that the 
provision of the Sixth Schedule shall be applied to the administration of the 
tribal areas in the State of Assam.  The tribal areas in Assam are governed 
not by the relevant provisions of the Constitution which apply to the other 
Constituent States of the Union of India but by the provisions contained in 
the Sixth Schedule.   These provisions purport to provide for a self-contained 
code for the governance of the tribal areas forming part of Assam and they 
deal with all the relevant topics in that behalf.  (See : <a href="/doc/761424/" id="a_3">Edwingson Bareh  vs.   
The State of Assam and others</a> : AIR 1966 SC 1220).  
</p>
<p id="p_8">Paragraph 1 of the Sixth Schedule provides for the formation of an 
autonomous district and further provides that if there are different scheduled 
tribes in an autonomous district, the Governor may by public notification 
divide the area or areas inhabited by them into autonomous regions.  
Paragraph 2 provides for the constitution of a District Council for each 
autonomous district.   Similarly for each autonomous region a separate 
Regional Council is provided.  The administration of an autonomous district 
insofar as it is not vested under the Schedule in any Regional Council within 
such district, is vested in the District Council for such district.  The 
administration of an autonomous region is vested in the Regional Council 
for such region.  Sub-paragraph (6) of paragraph 2 empowers the Governor 
to make Rules for the first constitution of District Councils and Regional 
Councils in consultation with the existing tribal Councils or other 
representative tribal organizations within the autonomous districts or regions 
concerned.  Paragraphs 3 to 17 make provision for the administration of the 
autonomous Districts and the Regions.  Paragraph 3 in particular provides 
that the District Council for an autonomous district in respect of all areas 
within the district except those which are under the authority of Regional 
Councils, if any, shall have power to make laws with respect to the matters 
enumerated therein which provide inter alia  "for the appointment or 
succession of Chiefs or Headmen".  The laws made under this paragraph are 
required to be submitted forthwith to the Governor and, until assented to by 
him, shall have no effect. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">In exercise of powers conferred upon him by sub-paragraph (6) of 
paragraph 2, the Governor framed rules called "the Assam Autonomous 
Districts (Constitution of District Councils) Rules, 1951".  The Rules 
provide, inter alia, for the constitution of an Executive Committee consisting 
of the Chief Executive Members as the head and two other members to 
exercise the executive functions of the District Council.
</p>
<p id="p_10">After the coming into the existence of Jowai District as an 
autonomous District the Jowai Autonomous District Act, 1967 was enacted.  
The provisions of this Act were made applicable to the Jowai Autonomous 
District and the Rules of 1951, as amended from time to time, were made 
applicable.   The Act, Rules and Regulations framed under the United Khasi-
Jaintia Hills District Council as listed in Appendix  I were also made 
applicable to the Jowai Autonomous District till such time the Jowai 
Autonomous District Council made its own laws.  Appendix  I includes the 
United Khasi Jaintia Hills Autonomous District (Appointment and 
Succession of Chiefs and Headmen) Act, 1959 (hereinafter referred to as 
'the 1959 Act') which was made applicable to the Jowai District Council.
</p>
<p id="p_11">Section 2 (a), (b) and (g) of the 1959 Act are as follows  :-
</p>

<p id="p_12">"2.  Definition.  In this Act, unless the context otherwise 
requires, the following expressions shall have the meanings 
hereby respectively assigned to them, that is to say :-   
</p>
<p id="p_13">(a)	"Chief" means a Sylem, a Lyngdoh, a Dolloi, a Sirdar or 
a Wahadadar as the case may be, of any Elaka.
</p>
<p id="p_14">(b)	"Custom" with reference to any Elaka means any rule 
regarding the appointment of a Chief or Headman for that 
Elaka which having been continuously and uniformly 
observed for a long time, has obtained the force of law in 
that Elaka.
</p><p id="p_15">.				.				.
</p>
<p id="p_16">(g)	"Elaka" means any administrative unit in the District 
specified in Appendixes I, II and III or any other 
administrative unit to be constituted and declared as 
such by the Executive Committee."
</p>

<p id="p_17">Section 3 reads as follows :-
</p>

<p id="p_18">"3.  Elections and Appointment of Chiefs and Headmen. -  
Subject to the provision of this Act and the Rules made 
thereunder all elections and appointments of Chiefs or 
Headmen shall be in accordance with the existing customs 
prevailing in the Elaka concerned."
</p>

<p id="p_19">	All appointments of Chiefs are made subject to the approval of the 
District Council which may confirm such appointments under terms and 
conditions which it may by Rules, from time to time, adopt.
</p>
<p id="p_20"> 	Under Appendix  III Jowai has been specified as an Elaka, headed by 
a Chief who would be a Dolloi.  Apart from challenging the constitutional 
validity of Section 3 of the Act of 1959, appellants also challenge the 
validity of the notice issued by the Secretary of Executive Committee  of 
Jowai District dated September 4, 2001 which is reproduced below :-
</p>

<p id="p_21">"OFFICE OF THE JAINTIA HILLS AUTONOMOUS DISTRICT

NOTICE

           DATED JOWAI, THE 4TH SEPT. 2001


This is Public Notice that the Executive Committee, Jaintia

and scrutinisation has decided that the following Clans has the right to 
stand for the election of the Dolloiship in the Elaka Jowsai :</p><pre id="pre_2">

</pre><p id="p_22">The Executive Committee has decided those who can contest

within the Raij Jowai.
</p>
<p id="p_23">					Sd/- E.M . Lyngdoh
				Secretary, Executive Committee
				Jaintia Hills Autonomous District
				Council, Jowai"
</p>
<p id="p_24">It is not disputed before us that Dolloi performs Administrative as 
well as religious functions and a Christian cannot perform the religious 
functions which are performed by Dolloi.  However, the appellants have 
impunged Section 3 of the Act of 1959 and the notifications issued on the 
following grounds:-
</p><p id="p_25">i)	The Notification issued is a law within the meaning of 
<a href="/doc/654960/" id="a_4">Article 13 (3) (a)</a> of the Constitution of India. 
</p><p id="p_26">ii)	Being a law preventing a person belonging to a particular 
religion from contesting election to a public post is 
violative of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of 
India, and therefore, void.
</p><p id="p_27">iii)	Section 3 which provides for the Election and 
Appointment of Dolloi in accordance with custom is void 
since the customs itself clearly discriminates on the 
ground of religion.  A custom must give way to 
fundamental right and any custom which offends the 
fundamental rights of a citizen must be held to be invalid.
</p>
<p id="p_28">On the other hand learned counsel appearing for the respondents 
submitted that there is no violation of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the 
Constitution of India since reasonable classification is permissible in law 
and the exclusion of Christians from contesting the election is not only on 
the ground of religion, but on the ground that they are unable to perform 
religious functions of the office of Dolloi.  It is further submitted that indeed 
the provisions only serve to conserve the tribal culture which itself is a 
fundamental right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_5">Article 29</a> of the Constitution of India.  
In substance, the impugned law and the notifications do not incur the wrath 
of Articles 14 to 16 of the Constitution, on the contrary, they enjoy the 
protection of <a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_6">Article 29</a> of the Constitution of India.  
</p>
<p id="p_29">On a consideration of the material placed before it the High Court 
came to the conclusion that a custom prevailed in the Elaka Jowai which on 
account of its long practice and by common consent acquired the status of a 
governing rule for election and appointment of Dolloi to perform both 
administrative and religious functions.  The fact that the Dolloi in Elaka 
Jowai is required to perform both administrative and the religious functions 
as prevalent by custom is not disputed.  What was submitted on behalf of the 
appellants was that 2 persons could be called upon to perform those duties, 
one performing the administrative duties and the other the religious 
functions.  Only 2 instances were cited when Christians were appointed as 
Dolloi of Elaka Jowai.  In the year 1890 an attempt was made to install a 
person who had converted himself into Chiristianity as Dolloi of Elaka 
Jowai, but he had to face the wrath of the people in performing the religious 
functions and ultimately had to resign from the post.  In the other case the 
Dolloi had to be removed by issuance of an order of termination.  The High 
Court found that since time immemorial the custom is to appoint one Dolloi 
who has to perform both administrative as well as religious functions.  
Moreover under the United Khasi-Jaintia Hills Autonomous District 
(Appointment and Succession of Chiefs and Headmen) Act, 1959 (Act 
No.11 of 1959) "service land" and "puja land" were given to Dolloi who 
was appointed as the "Chief".  "Service land" which was revenue free land 
was held and cultivated by the Chief or the Headman in lieu of monetary 
remuneration for services rendered.  "Puja land" was revenue free land held 
and cultivated by him and the income yielded therefrom  utilized by him in 
meeting expenses connected with the religious performances according to 
customs of the Elaka.  The High Court, therefore, recorded a finding that 
there was a custom prevalent for a long period which was invariably 
practiced to the effect that the "Chief", namely the Dolloi must perform 
administrative as well as religious duties.  There was no customs to appoint 
two Dollois  one for the performance of administrative duties and the other 
for the performance of religious functions.  Deviation for a short period on 
account of existing emergency which needed immediate correction did not 
derogate from its character as a custom.  The High Court concluded thus :-  
</p>
<p id="p_30">"On reading Section 3 read with Section 2(j) and 2(k) of the 
Act, 1959 and on the pleadings of the parties we hold that the 
Dolloi elected and appointed in Elaka Jowai was required to 
perform the executive function as well as religious functions 
which is a custom prevalent in the Elaka.  We further hold that 
there cannot be two Dollois one performing the administrative 
functions and the other performing the religious functions.  
Under the Act, 1959 there can be only one Dolloi performing 
both administrative as well as religious functions".
	An argument was advanced before the High Court, which was not 
advanced before us, that the notice issued on September 4, 2001 by the 
Secretary, Executive Committee, of the Jowai Autonomous District Council 
was without jurisdiction and authority.  The High Court negatived the 
contention and held that the Executive Committee in exercise of its 
delegated powers can issue such a public notice for appointment by election 
of Dolloiship in Elaka Jowai in the absence of rules, regulations or 
enactments providing for such election and appointment.  Reliance was 
placed on a judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/761424/" id="a_7">Edwingson Bareh  vs.  The State of 
Assam and others</a> (supra).  However, the High Court held that any 
law/regulation/rule/notification made or action taken under the Sixth 
Schedule by the District Council or the Executive Committee formed by the 
District Council must not in any manner commit a breach of any of the 
fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution of India.  
</p>
<p id="p_31">The High Court then proceeded to consider the submission urged 
before it that the exclusion of Christians from contesting election to the post 
of Dolloi violated Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India.  In 
doing so the High Court also noticed Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution 
of India and ultimately concluded that there was no breach of Articles 14, 15 
and 16 of the Constitution of India and in fact it protected the rights 
guaranteed under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India.  
</p>
<p id="p_32">The appellants in these appeals have challenged the correctness of the 
decision of the High Court.  
</p>
<p id="p_33">Shri P.K. Goswami, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the 
District Council (respondents 1 to 3) submitted that the High Court was right 
in holding that having regard to the facts of the case and the nature of the 
office of Dolloi, the notice excluding Christians from contesting for the post 
of Dolloi was fully justified.  Dolloi performs administrative as well as 
religious functions.  Such a custom and such an office existed since time 
immemorial and acquired the status of well preserved custom.  It, therefore, 
became the duty of the State to ensure the right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1858991/" id="a_8">Article 26</a> 
of the Constitution of India.  This was not really a case to which Articles 15 
and 16 were applicable, but even assuming that to be so, there was no 
discrimination since the exclusion of Christians was not only on the ground 
of religion, but on the ground that they could not perform the religious 
functions of the office which by custom a Dolli was  required to perform.  It 
is submitted that under Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India 
reasonable classification was permissible.  In particular he drew our 
attention to <a href="/doc/1759799/" id="a_9">Article 26(b)</a> of the Constitution of India and submitted that 
since the office of Dolloi involves the performance of both the 
administrative as well as religious duties, the concerned tribes had a right to 
manage their own affairs in matter of religion.   He relied upon authorities  
in support of his submission that the right of the tribes to have a Dolloi who 
could perform administrative as well as religious functions was a right 
guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1858991/" id="a_10">Article 26</a> of the Constitution of India.  
</p>
<p id="p_34">Mr. R.F. Nariman, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of 
respondents 5 and 6 analysed the provisions of Articles 14, 15, 16, 25, 26 
and 29 of the Constitution of India and submitted that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_11">Article 14</a> permitted 
reasonable classification in accordance with well settled principles. <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_12">Article 
15</a> was a species of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_13">Article 14</a> inasmuch it prohibited the State from 
discriminating against any citizen on the ground only of religion, race, caste, 
sex place of birth or any of them.  However, he emphasized the use of the 
words "on ground only of religion".  Thus if a citizen is discriminated 
against "on ground only of religion", such action may be unconstitutional.  
That however, is not the case here.  The exclusion is on account of the 
admitted fact that a Christian cannot perform the religious duties of a Dolloi.  
<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_14">Article 16</a> guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public 
employment but clause (5) thereof expressly provides that nothing in the 
article shall affect the operation of any law which provides that the 
incumbent of an office in connection with the affairs of any religious or 
denominational institution or any member of the governing body thereof 
shall be a person professing a particular  religion or belonging to a particular 
denomination.  He submitted that the right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_15">Article 25</a> of 
the Constitution was subject to other provisions of Part III of the 
Constitution of India but so far as <a href="/doc/1858991/" id="a_16">Article 26</a> was concerned, it was only 
subject to public order, morality and health.  So far as <a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_17">Article 29</a> is 
concerned it is a absolute right guaranteed for the conservation of a 
language, script or culture.  He submitted that the rights protected are those 
guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1759799/" id="a_18">Article 26(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/421731/" id="a_19">29(1)</a> of the Constitution.  He, therefore, 
submitted that election of a tribal head with all concomitants thereof was 
part of the tribal culture.  The Constitution guarantees uniformity in 
diversity.  The cultural rights under <a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_20">Article 29</a> of the Constitution of India 
are couched in the widest language unlike under Articles 25 and 26, which 
are subject to certain limitations.  Having regard to the nature of duties to be 
performed by a Dolloi the person elected as Dolloi must be religiously 
proficient to perform his religious duties.  It was really with a view to 
preserve their culture that a Christian was excluded from contesting the 
office of Dolloi which involved performance of religious duties, which he 
could not perform.  It was a core aspect of the tribal culture that Dolloi  must 
perform administrative functions as well as religious functions which 
involve performance of religious ceremonies which the High Court has 
elaborated in great detail.  According to him, Articles 14 to 16 were not at all 
breached and in the ultimate analysis the right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_21">Article 29</a> 
must prevail since it is the mandate of <a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_22">Article 29</a> that such cultural rights 
must be preserved.  There is force in the submissions advanced on behalf of 
the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_35"><a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_23">Article 14</a> ensures equality before law, which means that only persons 
who are in like circumstances should be treated equally.  To treat equally 
those who are not equal would itself be violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_24">Article 14</a> which 
embodies a rule against arbitrariness.  Thus classification is permissible if it 
satisfies the twin test of its being founded on intelligible differentia, which in 
turn has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.  
</p>
<p id="p_36"><a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_25">Article 15</a> prohibits the State from discriminating against any citizen 
on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them.  
This, however, is subject to the exception carved out by clauses 3 and 4 
which permit special provisions to be made in favour of women and 
children, and for socially and educationally backward classes of citizens i.e. 
for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  These are exceptions to the 
rule embodied in clauses (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_26">Article 15.</a>  
</p>
<p id="p_37"><a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_27">Article 16</a> also embodies the rule against discrimination, but is limited 
in its scope than <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_28">Article 15</a>, since it is confined to office or employment 
under the State, whereas <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_29">Article 15</a> covers the entire range of State activities.  
Descent and residence are the two additional grounds on which 
discrimination is not permissible under <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_30">Article 16.</a>  But the rule is again 
subject to the exceptions carved out by clauses 3 to 5 thereof.  Clause 5 is 
relevant for our purpose, and it provides as under :-
</p>
<p id="p_38">"(5)	Nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any 
law which provides that the incumbent of an office in 
connection with the affairs of any religious or denominational 
institution or any member of the governing body thereof shall 
be a person professing a particular religion or belonging to a 
particular denomination." 
</p>
<p id="p_39">Thus <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_31">Article 14</a> lays down the rule of equality in the widest term, 
while <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_32">Article 15</a> prohibit discrimination on grounds specified therein but 
covering the entire range of State activities.  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_33">Article 16</a> embodies the same 
rule but is narrower in its scope since it is confined to State activities relating 
to office or employment under the State.  Both Articles 15 and 16 operate 
subject to exceptions therein.  It has been so laid down by this Court in 
<a href="/doc/34768/" id="a_34">Government of A.P.  vs.   P.B. Vijayakumar and another</a> : (1995) 4 SCC 520 
and in <a href="/doc/722472/" id="a_35">Cazula Dasaratha Rama Rao  vs.  State of Andhra Pradesh and 
others</a>  :  AIR 1961 SC 564.  
</p>	
<p id="p_40">Counsel for the appellants submitted that prohibition against 
contesting for the post of Dolloi on the ground of religion ex-facie amounted 
to discrimination on the ground of religion.  On the contrary the respondents 
contend that the exclusion is not on the ground of religion alone, and 
therefore, does not invite the wrath of Articles 15 and 16.  The exclusion is 
justified on the ground that those who cannot perform the dual nature of 
functions of the Dolloi, namely administrative and religious  cannot be 
eligible for the post.  The exclusion, therefore, is neither arbitrary nor 
irrational.  It is axiomatic that one who cannot perform the duties attached to 
the office must be held to be ineligible to hold the office.  His exclusion, 
therefore, cannot be considered as either unreasonable or arbitrary or 
discriminatory.    
</p>
<p id="p_41">	The submission urged on  behalf of the respondents must be accepted.  
We have earlier noticed the findings of the High Court to the effect that it is 
the tribal custom of the Elaka that the Dolloi of the Elaka Jowai must 
perform both the administrative and religious functions of his office.  The 
High Court has exhaustively considered the evidence on record and 
considered the various rituals and observances, practices, poojas, 
ceremonies, customary religious functions which are regarded as integral 
part of religious customs, and which the Dolloi must perform in the 
discharge of his duties as the Dolloi.  Such rituals, observances, ceremonies 
etc. are many in number.  The material on record leaves no room for doubt 
that the office of Dolloi with its dual functions, administrative and religious, 
is a part of the tribal religion and culture, governed by custom since time 
immemorial.  It logically follows that the Dolloi must be one who is 
conversant with the indigenous religious practices of the inhabitants of the 
Elaka.  He must be one who should be able to lead the people of the Elaka in 
the religious ceremonies according to their custom, and must also be 
competent to perform the rituals, practices, poojas, ceremonies etc. which he 
is required to perform as a duty attached to his office.  It is not disputed that 
a Christian cannot perform the indigenous religious functions which a Dolloi 
is required to perform, apart from his administrative functions.  By long 
standing custom, the Dolloi must perform both administrative and religious 
functions, and such duties cannot be bifurcated by appointing one other to 
perform the religious functions only.  There is no such custom prevalent in 
the Elaka.  In its long history, such a thing happened only twice, and on both 
occasions there was a public outcry resulting in dismissal of the Dolloi in 
one case and his resignation in the other.  The custom cannot be said to be 
discontinued or destroyed by such aberrations.  The High Court has also 
noticed the judicial recognition given to the customary practice in the Khasi 
and Jaintia Hills that a Dolloi cannot be a Christian.  
</p>
<p id="p_42">	Having regard to all these facts, we are in agreement with the High 
Court that by excluding Christians from contesting the post of Dolloi, 
Articles 14, 15 and 16 are not violated.  The exclusion is justified by goond 
reason, since admittedly the religious duties of a Dolloi of Elaka Jowai 
cannot be performed by a Christian.  Thus the ground for exclusion of 
Christians is not solely the ground of religion, but on account of the admitted 
fact that a Christian cannot perform the religious functions attached to the 
office of Dolloi.  The reason cannot be said to be either unreasonable or 
arbitrary.
</p>
<p id="p_43">	Counsel for the appellants relied upon the decision of this Court in 
<a href="/doc/168292393/" id="a_36">John Vallamattom and another  vs. Union of India</a> : (2003) 6 SCCC 611, 
wherein this Court considered the challenge to the constitutional validity of 
<a href="/doc/956021/" id="a_37">Section 118</a> of the Succession Act, 1925.    The aforesaid provision was 
struck down by this Court on the ground of arbitrariness violating <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_38">Article 14</a> 
of the Constitution.  It found that even the classification of the Christians as 
a class by themselves was neither based on any intelligible differentia nor 
had any nexus with the object sought to be achieved.  It was, therefore, held 
to be discriminatory as also arbitrary.  But the challenge based on <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_39">Article 15</a> 
of the Constitution was repelled in the following words :-
</p>
<p id="p_44">"	So far as the second argument of the learned counsel for 
the petitioner is concerned, it is suffice to say that <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_40">Article 15</a> of 
the Constitution of India may not have any application in the 
instant case as the discrimination forbidden thereby is only such 
discrimination as is based, inter alia, on the ground that a 
person belongs to a particular religion.  The said right conferred 
by clause (1) of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_41">Article 15</a> being only on a "citizen", the same is 
an individual right by way of a guarantee which may not be 
subjected to discrimination in the matter of rights, privileges 
and immunities pertaining to him as a citizen.  In other words, 
the right conferred by <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_42">Article 15</a> is personal.  A statute, which 
restricts a right of a class of citizens in the matter of 
testamentary disposition who may belong to a particular 
religion, would, therefore, not attract the wrath of clause (1) of 
<a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_43">Article 15</a> of the Constitution of India."  	
</p>
<p id="p_45">	Mr. Nariman is, therefore, right in distinguishing this case on facts 
and the nature of legislation challenged and the infirmities found.  In fact, as 
he rightly submits, this decision, if at all, supports the case of the 
respondents, so far as challenge based on <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_44">Article 15</a> is concerned.    
</p>
<p id="p_46">	The appellants next relied on the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/450953/" id="a_45">Madhu 
Kishwar and others   vs.  State of Bihar and others</a>  : (1996) 5 SCC 125.  In 
that case the constitutional validity of Sections 7, 8 and 76 of the Chotanagar 
Tenancy Act, 1908 was challenged on the ground that the provisions 
violated Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India.  The right to 
intestate succession of Scheduled Tribe Women was governed by custom.  
<a href="/doc/1584850/" id="a_46">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/580257/" id="a_47">8</a> provided for exclusive right of male succession to the 
tenancy rights.  <a href="/doc/1279979/" id="a_48">Section 76</a> of the Act saved any custom, usage, or customary 
right not inconsistent with, or not expressly or by necessary implication 
modified or abolished by the provisions of the Act.  This Court did not 
consider it desirable to declare the customs of tribal inhabitants as offending 
Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India, though each case must be 
examined when full facts are placed before the Court.  This Court however 
gave some relief to female dependents by declaring that upon the death of 
the male tenant, they could hold on to the land so long as they remained 
dependent on it for earning their livelihood, for otherwise it would render 
them destitute.  Thus the exclusive right of male succession conceived of in 
<a href="/doc/1584850/" id="a_49">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/580257/" id="a_50">8</a> has to remain in suspended animation so long as the right of 
livelihood of the female descendants of the male holder remained valid and 
in vogue.  We find no principle laid down in this decision to support the case 
of the appellants herein, who in effect seek to challenge the validity of a 
custom recognized by and given effect to, by law.  On the contrary, this 
Court was of the view that striking down such a law on the touchstone of 
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_51">Article 14</a> would bring about a chaos in the existing state of law.
</p>
<p id="p_47">	We also do not find anything in the decision of this Court in State of 
Kerala and another vs.  Chandramohnan:  (2004) 3 SCC 429 to support the 
case of the appellants.  All that was held in that case was that by mere 
conversion to Christanity one does not cease to be a Scheduled Tribe if 
despite conversion he continues to follow the tribal traits and customs.  No 
such question arose in this case.   
</p>
<p id="p_48">	None of the decisions cited by the appellants supports the challenge to 
<a href="/doc/1141930/" id="a_52">Section 3</a> of the Act of 1959 and the Notifications impugned in the writ 
petitions on the ground of violation of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the 
Constitution.  On the other hand counsel for the respondents relied upon 
decisions in support of their contention, that the exclusion of Christians from 
contesting the election to the post of Dolloi in Jowai Elaka is not only on the 
ground of religion and, therefore, their exclusion cannot be challenged on 
the ground of violating Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India.  It 
was also contended that historical reasons may as well support the 
classification, provided it is rational and bears a nexus with the object sought 
to be achieved.  It was submitted that what was sought to be protected was 
indeed the tribal culture of the people inhabiting the autonomous District of 
Jowai.  Their tribal sentiments and religious values have been sought to be 
protected and given due respect having regard to social and economic 
considerations of the tribals inhabiting in the autonomous District.   Thus 
they contend that the exclusion is not based only on the ground of religion 
and consequently there is no discrimination within the meaning of Articles 
15 and 16 of the Constitution of India.  In this connection they have relied 
upon a decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1903603/" id="a_53">Air India  vs.  Nergesh Meerza and others</a> : 
(1981) 4 SCC 335 wherein this Court observed :-
</p>	
<p id="p_49">"Even otherwise, what Articles 15(1) and 16(2) prohibits is that 
discrimination should not be made only and only on the ground 
of sex.  These articles of the Constitution do not prohibit the 
State from making discrimination on the ground of sex coupled 
with other considerations.  On this point, the matter is no longer  
res integra but is covered by several authorities of this Court."
</p>

<p id="p_50">	<a href="/doc/1422425/" id="a_54">In Clarence Pais and others  vs.  Union of India</a> : (2001) 4 SCC 325 
the challenge to <a href="/doc/1617988/" id="a_55">Section 213</a> and <a href="/doc/111809/" id="a_56">57</a> of the Succession Act, 1925 was 
considered and repelled.  No doubt this Court held that the basis of the 
challenge, namely  that <a href="/doc/550614/" id="a_57">Section 213(1)</a> of the Act was applicable only to 
Christians and not to any other religion, was not correct.  However, the 
Court made pertinent observations in the following words :-
</p>
<p id="p_51">"We have shown above that it is applicable to Parsis after the 
amendment of the Act in 1962 and to Hindus who reside within 
the territories which on 1.9.1870 were subject to the Lt. 
Governor of Bengal or to areas covered by original jurisdiction 
of the High Courts of Bombay and Madras and to all wills 
made outside those territories and limits so far as they relate to 
immovable property situate within those territories and limits. If 
that is so, it cannot be said that the section is exclusively 
applicable only to Christians and, therefore, it is discriminatory. 
The whole foundation of the case is thus lost. The differences 
are not based on any religion but for historical reasons that in 
the British Empire in India, probate was required to prove the 
right of a legatee or an executor but not in Part "B" or "C" 
States. That position has continued even after the Constitution 
has come into force. Historical reasons may justify differential 
treatment of separate geographical regions provided it bears a 
reasonable and just relation to the matter in respect of which 
differential treatment is accorded. Uniformity in law has to be 
achieved, but that is a long drawn process. Undoubtedly, the 
States and Union should be alive to this problem. Only on the 
basis that some differences arise in one or the other States in 
regard to testamentary succession, the law does not become 
discriminatory so as to be invalid. Such differences are bound 
to arise in a federal set up."		
</p>    
<p id="p_52">	<a href="/doc/745161/" id="a_58">In R.C. Poudyal   vs.  Union of India and others</a> : 1994 Supp. (1) SCC 
324 reservation of one seat for the Sangha in the Sikkim Assembly was 
challenged.  In the reply it was urged that though Sangha was essentially a 
religious institution of the Buddhists, it however, occupied a unique position 
in the political, social and cultural life of the Sikkimese Society and the one 
seat reserved for it cannot, therefore, be said to be based on considerations 
'only' of religion.  This Court repelled the contention that reservation of  one 
seat in favour of the Sangha is one purely based on religious considerations 
and, therefore, violative of Articles 15(1) and 325 of the Constitution of 
India and offended its secular principles.  This Court held :-
"The Sangha, the Buddha and the Dharma are the three 
fundamental postulates and symbols of Buddhism. In that sense 
they are religious institutions. However, the literature on the 
history of development of the political institutions of Sikkim 
adverted to earlier tend to show that the Sangha had played an 
important role in the political and social life of the Sikkimese 
people. It had made its own contribution to the Sikkimese 
culture and political development. There is material to sustain 
the conclusion that the 'Sangha' had for long associated itself 
closely with the political developments of Sikkim and was 
inter-woven with the social and political life of its people. In 
view of this historical association, the provisions in the matter 
of reservation of a seat for the Sangha recognises the social and 
political role of the institution more than its purely religious 
identity. In the historical setting of Sikkim and its social and 
political evolution the provision has to be construed really as 
not invoking the impermissible idea of a separate electorate 
either. Indeed, the provision bears comparison to <a href="/doc/37191/" id="a_59">Art. 333</a> 
providing for representation for the Anglo-Indian community. 
So far as the provision for the Sangha is concerned, it is to be 
looked at as enabling a nomination but the choice of the 
nominee being left to the 'Sangha' itself. We are conscious that 
a separate electorate for a religious denomination would be 
obnoxious to the fundamental principles of our secular 
Constitution. If a provision is made purely on the basis of 
religious considerations for election of a member of that 
religious group on the basis of a separate electorate, that would, 
indeed, be wholly unconstitutional. But in the case of Sangha, it 
is not merely a religious institution. It has been historically a 
political and social institution in Sikkim and the provisions in 
regard to the seat reserved admit of being construed as a 
nomination and the Sangha itself being assigned the task of and 
enabled to indicate the choice of its nominee. The provision can 
be sustained on this construction. Contention (g) is answered 
accordingly."
</p>
<p id="p_53">	These decisions do justify the stand of the respondents that unless it is 
shown that the exclusion of Christians was only on religious ground, the 
challenge cannot be sustained.  In the instant case, we have noticed the 
reasons why such an exclusion was made and we have also held that the 
reasons therefor are neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.  We, therefore, 
conclude agreeing with the High Court that <a href="/doc/58423/" id="a_60">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act of 1959 
as also the Notifications impugned in the writ petitions cannot be struck 
down on the ground of violation of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the 
Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_54">	We may notice that the High Court has held that the spiritual 
fraternity represented by classes belonging to Niam Tynrai Niamtre (Non-
christian) who practice the indigenous religion within the Raij Jowai is a 
socio cultural religious organization of Jaintia people who follow Niam 
Tynrai Niamtre faith.  They are governed by common customary laws of 
their own in the matters of administration as well in following religious 
faith.  These classes within the Raij Jowai being followers of Niam Tynrai 
Niamtre are certainly a religious denomination within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1858991/" id="a_61">Article 
26</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_55">	Before us also, Mr. Goswami, learned counsel appearing for the 
respondents urged submissions based on Articles 25 and 26 of the 
Constitution of India.  Mr. Nariman, however, laid emphasis on <a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_62">Article 29</a> of 
the Constitution of India and submitted that the effort was really to conserve 
the culture of the tribal population in the autonomous District and, therefore, 
protected by <a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_63">Article 29</a> of the Constitution of India.  These are matters 
which may require consideration in an appropriate case.  So far as the instant 
case is concerned, having found that the challenge to the impugned 
provisions and Notifications was not sustainable on the ground of violation 
of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India, it is not necessary for 
us to deal with other issues which the respondents have urged on the basis of 
Articles 25, 26 and 29 of the Constitution of India in support of their stand.
