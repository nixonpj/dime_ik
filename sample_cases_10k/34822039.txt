    13/06/2008 to 15/06/2008. The complaint has been filed exactly after one 

    month   i.e.  on   16/07/2008.     Though,   the  wife   was  before   this   Court  on

    both of them against each other, the wife did not disclose that she had, in

    (Supra), in the caveat placed on the inherent powers under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_25">Section 482</a> of

<p id="p_16">           In the case of State of Karnataka (Supra), the Supreme Court held 

    that the power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_29">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C. should not be exercised to 

    stiffle a legitimate prosecution and the High Court should not assume the 

    role   of   a   trial   Court   and   embark   upon   an   enquiry.     The   said   power   is

<p id="p_17">    12     We have gone through the complaint in terms of the statement of the 




                                                               
    wife recorded on 16/07/2008 while registering C.R. No. 392 of 2008 and 

    on the peculiar facts of this case, we are satisfied that even prima facie, 




                                                              
    there is no material in support of the charge under <a href="/doc/668689/" id="a_30">Section 376-A</a> of the 

    IPC.  The complaint read in its totality also does not make out the case for 




                                                 
    the   offences   punishable   under   Section,   either   341   or   506   of   the   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_31">IPC</a>.

<p id="p_18">    Despite   the   fact,   both   the   husband   and   wife   are   engaged   in   series   of 

    litigation   right   from   the   Court   of   Civil   Judge,   Senior   Division   to   the 
                               
    Supreme   Court,   as   of   now,   we   do   not   find   any   reason   to   subject   the 

    husband for an inquiry into C.R. No. 392 of 2008 as the said complaint read 
        


    as it is, does not make out any case to proceed against him for the offences 
     



    punishable under <a href="/doc/668689/" id="a_32">Sections 376-A</a>, <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_33">341</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_34">506</a> of the IPC.  We do not agree 

    with   the   submissions   of   Mr.   Malik   that   there   was   a   separation   as   per 





    "custom" or "usage" between the parties and the same could be allowed to 

    be proved in the trial.  Such a case has not been made out  in the Complaint 





    and on the contrary, the complaint read as it is, goes to show that the wife 

    came with the husband of her own and by way of afterthought, the C.R. has 

    been registered one month later and the said act was even suppressed from 

    the High Court when the consent order was passed on 12th August, 2008.
