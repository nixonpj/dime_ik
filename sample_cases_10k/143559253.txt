                    instant appeal at the behest of the plaintiff/appellant.

</p><p id="p_5">                                It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant

                    that both the Courts below gravely erred in holding that suit land

                    had been already partitioned between the parties. In fact, there

                    was joint khata of the appellant and the respondents. The

                    agricultural land of the appellant had been partitioned vide order

                    dated 31.08.2010, passed by the Tehsildar-cum-AC 1st Grade,

                    Gurdaspur (Ex.P4). Thereafter, the suit land measuring 5 kanals

                    8 marlas was kept joint, however, the learned Courts below have

                    not taken into consideration this aspect of the matter. The

                    documents Ex.D3 and Ex.D4 which the learned Courts below

                    have relied upon were not proved by any independent witness.

                    The learned counsel further submits that the appellant has fully

                    proved his share in the suit property by leading oral as well as

                    documentary evidence but the Courts below have not considered

                    the same and dismissed the suit of the plaintiff/appellant.

                    Therefore, the findings of learned Courts below on the issues

                    framed are illegal and erroneous in the eye of law and therefore,

                    both the judgments deserve to be set aside.

</pre><p id="p_7">                                The Court has perused the entire record. It was the

                    version of the plaintiff/appellant that the suit land was never

                    partitioned and it was gair mumkin in nature. But in his cross

                    examination, the plaintiff/appellant, while appearing as PW1 had

                    admitted that the suit land had been partitioned. Furthermore, it

                    was not disputed by the parties that the original land measuring

                    94 kanals 10 marlas was a joint khata. The partition order Ex.P4

                    dated 31.08.2010 did not reflect if the khasra numbers in dispute

                    had gair mumkin land or constructions. Naksha zeem, Ex.P5

                    showed that the property was agricultural in nature. The plaint

                    and the written statement reveals that the property had

                    construction on it and this version was reiterated by the

                    plaintiff/appellant in his examination in chief. However, in his

                    cross examination, he deposed against his own version and

                    admitted pleadings of the defendants that partition had been

                    effected and separate shares were being cultivated by the

                    respective parties. On consideration, this Court finds that the

                    contentions have no merit as they only relate to the appreciation

                    of evidence. No evidence is shown to have been ignored from

                    consideration, nor there is any misreading of evidence. These are

                    pure findings of fact. No question of law, much less substantial
