        Two writ petitions, challenging the
issuance of an work order in terms of a
tender for hire of one survey-cum-pilot
vessel issued by the Kolkata Port Trust, are
taken up for consideration analogously as
they involve the same issues.
        W.P. 9101 (W) of 2017 is first in the
point of time. It is referred to as the first
petition for the sake of convenience. The
learned    senior       advocate    appearing    in
support of the first petition submits that,
the Kolkata Port Trust authorities (KOPT)
has awarded a tender in favour of the
respondent nos. 4 and 5 in gross violation
of the essential terms and conditions of the
subject tender. He refers to the Clause 2 of
the prequalification criteria at annexure B
of the tender notice. He submits that, the
respondent nos. 4 and 5 does not fulfil the
experience       and       financial     capability
required under the subject tender.               He
draws     the    attention    of   the   Court   to
appendix 5 and appendix 6 of the tender
documents and submits that, an individual
member of a consortium is required to give
its   individual     details.      The   individual
tenderers are also required to submit an
                        3


annual turnover for the last three years
that are specified being the financial years
2013-2014, 2014-2015 and 2015-2016. He
submits that, the respondent nos. 4 and 5
do not fulfil such criteria, as one of the
private respondents was not incorporated
in the first two of such financial years. He
refers to Clause 6.0 of the annexure to the
tender documents and submits that the
technical and financial capability of the
private respondent nos. 4 and 5 have been
miscalculated. He refers to page 149 of the
writ petition which is the certificate issued
by   the   Chartered       Accountant   of    the
respondent nos. 4 and 5 in respect of the
turnover. He submits that, the respondent
nos. 4 and 5 do not fulfil Clause 2 of the
prequalification     criteria.     In        such
circumstances, he submits that, the award
of contract in favour of the respondent nos.
4 and 5 should be quashed.
      W.P. 9756 (W) of 2017 being second
in point of time is referred to a second
petition for the sake of convenience. The
learned    senior   advocate     appearing     in
support of second writ petition adopts the
submissions made on behalf of first writ
petitioners. In addition thereof, he submits
that, in view of the fact that the respondent
no. 4 and 5 do not have the requisite
technical and the financial capability, the
                                 4


grant of the contract should be set asidze.
He relies upon the assessment of eligibility
as provided in the tender documents at
Clauses 6.2 onwards. He submits that, the
respondent nos. 4 and 5 do not fulfil such
eligibility criteria.
       The            learned        senior      advocate
appearing         on       behalf      of     the      KOPT
authorities submits that, the petitioners of
the first petitioner does not have the locus
standi      to    file    and       maintain     the    writ
petition.        He submits that, the first writ
petitioner did not participate in the tender
process. He refers to the averments made
in the first petition in support of such
contention.           That      apart,      he      submits
referring        to      the    various       terms     and
conditions of the tender that the tender
evaluation committee has considered the
tender of the respondent nos. 4 and 5 and
has found the same to be satisfying the
eligibility criteria. He relies upon Clause 3
of the annexure-B under the heading
prequalification criteria and submits that,
average annual financial turnover of the
firm during the last three years ending
March       2016          is    to    be      taken     into
consideration. He refers to page 149 of the
first writ petition and submits that the
consortium fulfils such eligibility criteria
                         5


and hence the bid of the respondent nos.4
and 5 has been accepted.
      The learned senior advocate for the
respondent nos.4 and 5 of the first writ
petition submits that, the respondent nos.
4 and 5 have constituted a special purpose
vehicle to execute the contract. He refers to
various terms and conditions of the tender
and submits the requisite eligibility criteria
in participating in the tender process is
fulfilled by his clients. In the present case,
the respondent nos. 4 and 5 have since
incorporated a special purpose vehicle to
execute the contract.
      [In reply, the learned senior advocate
appearing in support of the first writ
petition refers to (1979) 3 Supreme Court
cases 489 (Ramana Dayaram Shetty-Vs-
International Airport Authority of Indi) and
submits that the petitioner has the locus
standi to maintain the writ petition. The
right of the petitioner to participate in the
tender has been infringed by the action of
the KOPT authorities. Had the petitioner
known that an essential eligibility criteria
would be waived or would be read in the
manner sought to be done by the KOPT
authorities, it would have participated in
the tender process. The writ petition is,
therefore, maintainable.]

      I   have       considered        the    rival
contentions    of    the    parties     and     the
materials made available on record.

      KOPT     had    floated     a    tender    in

the   same.    The     relevant       terms     and
conditions of the subject tender are set out
hereinbelow:

</p>
<p id="p_8">         The respondent nos. 4 and 5 and the
second writ petitioner had participated in
the tender process. The writ petitioner of
the first writ petition did not participate
therein.
</p>
<p id="p_9">         Ramanna Dayaram Shetty (supra)
considers      a    similar    issue        of
maintainability as raised herein. It is of the
view that, a writ petitioner at the behest of
a non-participant is maintainable, where
the petitioner alleges non-adherence to the
essential conditions and waiver of the same
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                       10</span>


by the authorities. The first writ petition,
therefore, maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       The    question       while    falls    for
consideration is whether the acceptance of
the tender of the respondent nos. 4 and 5
is justified by the KOPT authorities or not.
The KOPT authorities have read Clause 3
appearing at page 62 of the first writ
petition to mean that it is entitled to take
the    average   of   the    annual    financial
turnover for a participant during the last
three years ending March 2016 and that
such average annual financial turnover
should be at least Rs.99.81 lakhs. A
Chartered accountant certificate at page
149 of the first writ petition shows the
break up of the annual financial turnover
of the respondent nos. 4 and 5 for the last
three years. For one of the respondents,
there are two nil entries for the financial
years 2013-14, 2014-15. The total actual
turnover of the specified three years for
both    the   participants    are    taken    into
consideration. An average annual financial
turnover is thereafter sought to be arrived
at by the KOPT authorities. On an average
being taken, the KOPT authorities finds
that such average to be in excess of the
prescribed limit of Rs.99.91 lakhs. This
undertaking of the essential conditions of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                        11</span>


the tender is contended to be incorrect on
behalf of the two writ petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      The understanding of the terms and
conditions of the subject tender of KOPT is
a plausible one given the terms and
conditions as appearing in the subject
tender. It is not the case of the petitioners
that the KOPT authorities have applied
different        standards     or     different
interpretations of the same Clause in
considering the tenders of the participants.
The view of KOPT was applied uniformly to
all tenderers.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      Clause 3.1 page 62 of the first writ
petition permits the KOPT authorities to
take the average annual financial turnover
of the firm during the last three years
ending March 2016. It has done so.
Therefore,   this    conduct   of   the   KOPT
authorities and its ultimate decision in
awarding the tender in respect of the
respondent nos.4 and 5 and that cannot be
faulted.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      The other Clauses referred to by the
learned senior advocates for the two writ
petitioners does not, in my view, dilute or
make the view taken by KOPT authorities
in understanding the terms of the subject
contract bad. Such other Clauses also do

not establish that the view taken by the
KOPT authorities is incorrect.

<p id="p_14">      In such circumstances, I find no
merit in the two writ petitions

      W.P. 9101 (W) OF 2017 and W.P.
9756 (W) OF 2017              are   dismissed
without any order as to costs.
