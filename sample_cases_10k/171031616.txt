</pre>


<p id="p_1">A.HARIPRASAD, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">                Ext.P7      order,   passed       by   the   Rent   Control   Court,


Thiruvananthapuram on I.A No.1852 of 2017 in RCP No.76 of 2016, is


under challenge.
</p>

<p id="p_3">        2.      The short history of the case is as follows :
</p>

<p id="p_4">        The respondent filed an application under Section 5 of the Kerala


Building (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1965 (in short 'the Act') for fixation of


fair rent. In that proceedings, Ext.P2 application was filed for issuance of a


Commission. Aggrieved by the order passed in Ext.P2, the petitioner


approached the Appellate Authority under the Act and later this Court with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> O.P (R.C) No.53 of 2019                   3</span>




O.P(RC) No.6 of 2018. After considering the entire aspects, a Division Bench


of this Court on 22nd February, 2018 passed a judgment in O.P(RC) No.6 of


2018 issuing the following directions :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              " 9. The discussions as above would reveal that mere

              setting aside of Ext.P5 order would restore Ext.P4 order

              and it would ultimately result in grave injustice or

              failure of justice. We have already held that the Rent

              Control Court too, committed an error which is

              manifest and apparent on the face of the record and we

              have also made it clear that a court could not prevent a

              party from adducing the best evidence and further that

              the relevancy or admissibility of evidence is a matter

              for the court to consider only at the appropriate stage.

              The long and short of the discussions is that Ext.P5

              order is liable to be set aside. At the same time, it

              cannot result in restoration of Ext.P4 order as it is, in

              view of the reasons assigned by us hereinbefore. In

              such circumstances, the only course for this Court is to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> O.P (R.C) No.53 of 2019                       4</span>




              set aside Ext.P4 as well and to issue a further direction

              to the Rent Control Court to reconsider Ext.P2

              application, in accordance with law after hearing both

              sides.       Consequently, Ext.P4 is also set aside.

              I.A.No.1852 of 2017 in R.C.P.No.76 of 2016 is restored

              into        the   file   of     Rent   Control      Court,

              Thiruvananthapuram and there will be a further

              direction to Rent Control Court, Thiruvananthapuram

              to consider Ext.P2 application viz., I.A.No.1852 of 2017

              afresh, in accordance with law after hearing both sides.

              We make it clear that it would be open to the parties to

              argue whether the matters sought to be ascertained as

              per the said I.A, are matters falling within the purview

              of Edger Ferus' case or not."</blockquote>

<p id="p_5">        3.      Grievance of the petitioner is that despite giving direction by this


Court to follow the principles in <a href="/doc/1378804/" id="a_1">Edger Ferus v. Abraham Ittycheria</a> (2004 (1)


K.L.T 767), the court below in Ext.P7 flouted the principles and allowed the

Commission application to gather unnecessary details shown in Ext.P2.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> O.P (R.C) No.53 of 2019                   5</span>




<p id="p_6">        4.      We heard the learned counsel for the petitioner in detail. Having


regard to nature of the orders that is to be passed in this case, we do not find


any need to issue notice to the respondent. It is clear from the impugned


order itself that the Rent Control Court has understood the fact that all the


matters reported by the Commissioner at the time of local inspection cannot


be relied on for deciding the case. Apprehension of the petitioner, that the


court below would transgress the limits in the directions, can only be an


illusion. The court below has passed an order to appoint a Commissioner only


to gather the details mentioned in Ext.P2. It does not mean that the court has


decided to accept all the matters that will be reported. The petitioner is free to


argue before the court below that irrelevant aspects reported by the


Commissioner, if any, shall not be looked into at the time of deciding the


question of fixation of fair rent in accordance to the guidelines given in this


case. The petitioner's right to dispute the non-acceptability of irrelevant


aspects brought in by the Commissioner will be protected and on that basis,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> O.P (R.C) No.53 of 2019                  6</span>




we find no reason to entertain this petition. Hence, the original petition is


dismissed.

<p id="p_7">        All pending interlocutory applications will stand dismissed.
