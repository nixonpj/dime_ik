                          "Many years back, when I was aged about 5 to 6 years, one day,
                 exact date or time I do not remember at present, I was playing outside
                 my house and I was kidnapped by uncles namely Anil and Subhash, who
                 are present in court today (correctly identified). I do not remember the
                 exact place where they took me. I remained with the accused for around
                 nine days......"
</p>


<p id="p_21">                   The witness has specifically stated in his cross examination that
         "During the period of my detention, I have not seen the accused
         persons."
</p><p id="p_22">                   Analysis of the testimony of this witness does not repose
         confidence in the sense that in his statement recorded u/s 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11">Cr.P.C</a>. as
         well as in his testimony he is identifying the accused whereas in his cross
         examination he is specifically deposing that he has not seen the accused
         persons without assuring the identity of the accused persons. I feel
         hesitant in holding that the accused Anil, who as per the deposition of this
         witness, was very much living in the same house of the victim, has
         kidnapped the witness PW7. Material testimony of other two witnesses


FIR No. 323/99            PS Bhajanpura            State Vs. Subhash &amp; Ors.           Page No.6/8
          PW Narender and PW Usha who is his wife have brought the attention of
         the court to the fact that the parties namely the complainant and accused
         persons were having some truffle/altercation over the sharing of charhawa
         at Jagran. The version of the complainant is that it is due to said
         disagreement over the sharing of charhawa, the accused had committed
         offence of kidnapping so as to settle the scores with the complainant
         whereas the testimony of both the DWs adduced on behalf of accused
         suggested that it is due to the said disagreement rather the complainant,
         so as to settle the scores with the accused, implicated them in a false
         case. Weighing the version/suggestion on the balance of probabilities, I
         do not find force in the suggestion made by the material witnesses PW
         Narender and PW Usha.
</p>

<p id="p_23">         6.6     Another factum which is coming on record is that the victim was
         very much living with the accused in the same house as admittedly,
         accused Anil and his relative Subhash were living as tenant with the
         parents of the victim. It is in the light of the fact that victim is living in the
         same house with the accused.
</p><p id="p_24">                 It is difficult to hold that the accused was taken or enticed by the
         accused persons out of the keeping of the lawful guardianship of PW
         Narender and PW Usha. In order to prove kidnapping, the prosecution is
         required to prove that the accused had taken or enticed the victim out of
         the keeping of his lawful guardianship. What is necessary is either taking
         or enticing of the minor. One does not entice other unless the latter admits
         to do a thing which he or she would not otherwise have done. In order to
         bring home to conviction for kidnapping, there must be proof of accused
         having done something which led to the victim going out of the keeping of
         his lawful guardianship.
</p><p id="p_25">                 Perusal of the testimony of material witness reflect that there is
         absence of the major ingredient, benefit of which is being given to the
         accused.
