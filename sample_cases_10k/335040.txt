-Vs-

The Income Tax Officer,
Ward I(1),
Karaikudi                               ...                     Respondent


        This appeal has been filed under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1">Section 260A</a> of the Income  Tax  Act,
1961,  against the order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal "A" Bench, dated
9.9.2001 in ITA No.2203/Mds/95.

<p id="p_1">A.S.VENKATACHALAMOORTHY, J.
</p><p id="p_2">                This appeal is directed against the order  of  the  Income-Tax
Appellate  Tribunal,  upholding  the  orders  of  the authorities below and it
pertains to the assessment  year  1991-1992.    The  dispute  relates  to  the
computation  of  long  term capital gains arising out of the transfer of 4 198
shares held by the appellant in M/s Consolidated Coffee  Limited  (hereinafter
referred  to  as  'CCL')  to M/s Tata Tea Limited ( hereinafter referred to as
'TTL').
</p>
<p id="p_3">                2.  The appellant was holding 4198 shares in  CCL.    The  TTL
desired to acquire the majority shares in CCL and this prompted TTL to make an
open offer  to  the shareholders of the CCL.  The offer was to the effect that
for transfer of every two shares of CCL  to  TTL,  the  latter  would  give  a
consideration  in  cash  of  Rs.100/-  and  one  equity share of face value of
Rs.10/- out of the fresh issue of  TTL.    This  offer  was  made  by  TTL  on
20.10.1989 and  the  same  was accepted by the appellant.  Following this, TTL
formalised the contract by sending the  transfer  deed  for  the  transfer  of
shares in  CCL,  on  31.10.1990.   The appellant received the consideration as
stipulated in the offer i.e, Rs.100 /- in cash and a fresh issue of one equity
share in TTL of the face value of Rs.10/- for every two shares in  CCL.    The
appellant while submitting his return for 1991-1992, apparently worked out the
capital   gains   pertaining  to  4198  shares  of  CCL  by  taking  the  sale
consideration of Rs.55/- per share, which figure he arrived at by  calculating
as follows,
                                Rs.100/- + Rs.10/-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                        2</span>
<p id="p_4">The  Assessing  Officer,  however took note of the fact that by a letter dated
8.10.1990, the TTL informed the appellant that the market price of each  share
of  TTL  has  gone  up  to Rs.450/- and proceeded to find out the value of the
shares of TTL as on 31.10.1990 as per the daily  official  listing  of  Bombay
Stock Exchange.    The  Assessing  Officer found, the Stock Exchange mentioned

Rs.400.25 as value of one share of TTL and adopting that,  computed  the  full
value  of  the consideration received by the appellant at Rs.10,50,025/- (2099
TTL shares at Rs.400.25 + Rs.2,09,900 (2099 x 100)).
</p>
<p id="p_5">                3.  The appellant filed an appeal before the  Commissioner  of
Income  Tax contending that the Assessing Officer ought to have taken only the
face value of the equity share of TTL at Rs.10/- and not the market  value  at
Rs.400.25.   However,  this  contention  was  not  accepted  by  the appellate
authority, which prompted the appellant to file an Income  Tax  Appeal  before
the Income  Tax  Appellate  Tribunal, Madras.  By an order dated 4.9.2001, the
Tribunal dismissed the appeal upholding the orders of the  authorities  below.
Being  aggrieved  by  the  orders referred above, the appellant has filed this
appeal before this Court.
</p><p id="p_6">                4.   The  question  is,  for  the  purpose  of  computing  the
consideration received for transfer of shares in CCL, whether the market value
of  the  shares of TTL allotted to the assessee should be adopted or the value
of the said allotted shares shown as paid up in the books of accounts of TTL ?
</p>
<p id="p_7">                5.  This Court is inclined to consider the  entire  matter  in
the way  indicated  hereunder.    Just  like the appellant/assessee, number of
other shareholders in CCL transferred their shares in CCL and in exchange, got
shares in TTL and also Rs.100/- for each share in TTL.  One  such  person  was
Smt.AL.VE.Muthayee Achi.    The Tribunal considered her case in ITA No.2452 of
1995 and fixed the value of one TTL Share at Rs.147/-.  In fact that order  of
the  Tribunal  has  been extensively quoted in the present order passed by the
Tribunal.  After so quoting, the Tribunal has observed as follows,
"...  Because the shares of Tata Tea Ltd., were marketable and  had  a  market
value   of   Rs.147  on  31.12.1990,  the  Assessing  Officer  took  the  sale
consideration at Rs.247, that is Rs.147 being  market  value  plus  Rs.100  as
total sale  consideration.    This is what has been applied by the Tribunal in
the case referred to earlier.  ..."
</p><p id="p_8">After so pointing out, the Tribunal proceeded to observe as follows,

"...  There being no other material difference in the facts of the case before
us, the issue having been  examined  on  all  fours  by  the  Tribunal  supra,
following  the  earlier  order  of  the  Tribunal, we uphold the orders of the
authorities below and dismiss the appeal of the assessee."
</p>
<p id="p_9">If the Tribunal is following the earlier order passed in Tmt.AL.VE.   Muthayee
Achi's  case  referred  by  us  supra, then the Tribunal should have fixed the
value of TTL at Rs.147/-.  In that event,  the  Tribunal  cannot  dismiss  the
appeal filed  by  the assessee.  The reading of the order of the Tribunal as a
whole would only show that the Tribunal came to the conclusion that one  share
of TTL has to be fixed at Rs.147/-.
</p><p id="p_10">                6.   That  apart,  even  on the ground of equity, fairness and
reasonableness, the revenue, having accepted the value of one share at  Rs.147
/-  with reference to another assessee identically placed, cannot be permitted
to fix a higher value for a share in TTL at the relevant time.
A.S.VENKATACHALAMOORTHY, J.
</p><p id="p_11">&amp; P.K.MISRA, J.
</p>

<p id="p_12">                7.  In this view of the matter, we allow the  appeal  in  part
and hold that the revenue shall proceed to calculate on the basis of the value
of  one share of TTL at Rs.147/- and claim on that basis, the tax due from the
assessee.
