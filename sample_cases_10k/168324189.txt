</p><p id="p_13">5.                From the aforesaid, it is clear that there is a consensus between 

the parties qua the fact the wife of petitioner No.1 had left her matrimonial 

home   and   now  is   residing   at   Ludhiana.     It   is   further   not   disputed   by  the 

respondents that it is now the petitioner No.1 only, who has to look after his 

both children, who admittedly are of tender age.  In my view this factum is a 

"subsequent material development" in the case and would have a bearing on 

the final outcome of the case.

</p><p id="p_15">6.                As regards the prayer of respondents qua amendment of written 

statement by inserting a fresh paragraph at the end of para No.18(a)(xiii) of 

the same is concerned, it is noticed that the same are incomplete and does not 

reflect the true correct picture of subsequent developments, as the petition 

[bearing   No.24/13   and   stated  to be  pending  disposal  in the  Court   of   Shri 

Munish Markan, Ld.RC (SE)] filed by petitioner No.2 is in respect of shop 

No.1 which has no concern with the tenanted suit premises, which is shop No.

2, situated at the ground floor of premises No.HS­19, Kailash Colony, New 

Delhi.       The   said   contention   raised   by   respondents   by   way   of   aforesaid 

application is accordingly rejected.  I further do not find any substance in the 

argument of learned counsel for respondents that since the present petition 

has been filed by two petitioners, so petitioner No.1 solely has no right file an 

application U/o 6 Rule 17 CPC and instead the same should have been moved 

jointly by the both the respondents, as the same is without any legal basis and

there is no law which debars one of the petitioner to move an application U/o 

6   Rule   17   CPC   in   his   individual   capacity,   thereby   raising   the   grounds   of 

subsequent   developments.     Moreover,   petitioner   No.2   has   given   statement 

before the Court that he has no objection if the application of petitioner No.1 

U/o 6 Rule 17 CPC is allowed.

</p><p id="p_17">7.                It is settled law through a catena of judgments that at the stage of 

considering the amendments, the merits or demerits of the amendment sought 

to be made cannot be gone into.  Reference in this regard can be had to the 

observations made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case reported as, "AIR  

2006 SC 1647", titled as, "Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal &amp; Anr. V/s K.K Modi &amp;  

Ors.", wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court has been pleased to hold that while 

considering the application for amendment that it should or should not be 

allowed, the court should not go into the correctness or falacity of the case in 

the amendment.   Likewise, the court should not record the finding on the 

merits of the amendment and the merits sought to be incorporated by way of 

amendment  are not to be adjudged at the stage of allowing the prayer for 

amendment and the real test is "real controversy test".

proceedings which have bearing upon the rights of the parties.    Reference  in 

this    regard     can     be  had   to the judgment  of  the Hon'ble  Supreme Court 

reported   as,   "AIR   2001   SC   699",   titled   as,   "Rahgu   Tilak   D.   John   v/s  

Raippan", as also case reported as, "2006 Vol.II CCS 2006 (Bombay)", titled 

as, "Atul Medical, Pune V/s Cadilla Healthcare Pvt. Ltd.".   Para 7 of this 

judgment lays down the law:

                   "7. In   my   opinion,   the   trial   court   erred   in  
                   rejecting   the   application.   The   proposed  
                   amendment   merely   introduces   certain   additional  
                   facts which are not inconsistent with the averments  
                   made in the plaint.   The subsequent events which  
                   are sought to be brought on record arise out of the  
                   facts which are the basis of the suit.  On the basis  
                   of   the   said   subsequent   events,   the   plaintiff   is  
                   seeking   certain   further   reliefs.   Neither   the  
                   proposed   new   paragraphs   nor   the   proposed  
                   prayers         change   the   nature   of   suit   by  
                   introducing something  which   is   diametrically  
                   opposed to the averments made in the plaint.   It  
                   cannot   be   said   that   the   amendment   destroys   the  
                   effect of the earlier averments.

and the replies thereto of both the parties vis­a­vis the law laid down in the 

aforesaid authorities,   I am of the considered opinion that the  application

including the issues sought to be covered by the respondents/tenants.   As 

such, the aforesaid two applications are disposed off as under:

allowed and he is accordingly permitted to carry out necessary amendment(s)

that wife of petitioner No.1 has left her matrimonial house and is now not  

residing with petitioner No.1 is allowed while their prayer to seek addition of  

paragraph/words in the written statement after para No.18(a) (xvi) [as lying  

mentioned in first stanza of para 5 of their application]  is rejected.  



</p><p id="p_22">10.               Needless   to   say,   the   petitioner   No.1   would   now   file   a   fresh 

amended petition thereby incorporating all the facts/subsequent events which 

have been averred by him in his application in question, within a period of 10 

days   from   today   with   advance   copy   thereof   to   the   respondents.   The

response to the amended petition, within a period of 10 days after receipt of 

copy of amended petition by them.
