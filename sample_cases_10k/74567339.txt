Judgement on             : 30/10/2014




      Subrata Talukdar, J.: In this CO 2064 of 2013 challenge is

thrown to the judgment dated 30th April, 2013 passed by the Learned

Civil Court (Junior Division), Kurseong in Title Suit No. 1 of 2010 by

which the ld. Court was pleased to finally consider the suit filed by the

present petitioner/plaintiff under <a href="/doc/1773715/" id="a_1">Section 6</a> of the Specific Relief Act.

The case of the present petitioner/plaintiff in the suit claiming

restoration of possession and permanent injunction was as follows:-
</p><p id="p_6"> a) That the petitioner/plaintiff constructed one CI sheet roofed brick

   wall, road level pucca floor, temporary structure on the road side of

   the government land (PWD) at Parijat Nagar, Sevoke Bazar, PS

   Kurseong, District Darjeeling in the year 1984.          In the said

   temporary structure the petitioner/plaintiff started a hotel and

   restaurant business under the name and style of 'Gautam Hotel'.

</p><p id="p_7">b) The Petitioner/plaintiff claims to be the proprietor of the said hotel

   and has obtained trade licence which stands renewed from time to

   time. He has also obtained electricity connection and pays other

   levies in respect of the said hotel business.

</p><p id="p_8">c) The petitioner/plaintiff alleges that his peaceful and uninterrupted

   possession    of    the    suit   premises      was   disturbed    by

   defendant/opposite party No. 1 (OP1) on 17th August, 2009.

   According to the petitioner/plaintiff the present OP1/defendant

   forcibly took away cash from the counter of the hotel and thereafter

   assaulted the petitioner/plaintiff.   As a result of the assault the

   petitioner/plaintiff was admitted to the nursing home.

</p><p id="p_9">d) That following the incidents of 17th August, 2009, the suit premises

   was kept under lock and key by the petitioner/plaintiff. However,

   on 27th August, 2009 the OP1/defendant illegally and forcibly

   entered the suit premises and took possession of the same by
    dispossessing      the    petitioner/plaintiff.   Thereafter     the

   OP1/defendant is running the said hotel without lawful authority.

   Hence the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_10">   The case of the OP1/defendant before the learned Trial Court was

as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_11">i) That the late father of both the petitioner/plaintiff and the

   OP1/defendant, one Jagat Gazmer constructed a two-storied

   building with tin roof at the road level and started running a hotel

   under the name and style of 'Gouttam Line Hotel'. The business of

   'Gouttam Line Hotel' as well as a travel business was looked after

   by the late Jagat Gazmer with the assistance of the present

   OP1/defendant.       The petitioner/plaintiff was responsible for

   looking after the travel business of their late father and a separate

   restaurant by the name of 'Vivek Restaurant'

</p><p id="p_12">ii) However, after the death of Jagat Gazmer on 22nd March, 2007, the

   petitioner/plaintiff and the OP1/defendant entered into a mutual

   family settlement wherein it was decided that the OP1/defendant

   would continue to run the business of 'Gouttam Line Hotel' and the

   petitioner/plaintiff would run the travel business and the Vivek

   Restaurant.     The OP1/defendant has, therefore, argued that the

   petitioner/plaintiff was never in possession of the said 'Gouttam
    Line Hotel' and the question of his forcible and illegal dispossession

   does not arise.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      The learned Trial Court, on the basis of the respective

   submissions of the parties, framed ten issues for consideration.

   The petitioner/plaintiff relied on Exbts 1 to 9 and the defendant

   relied on Exbts (a) to (d).
</p>
<p id="p_14">   The learned Trial Court was pleased to come to the following

findings:-
</p>
<p id="p_15">A) That the story of the OP1/defendant that he used to run 'Gouttam

   Hotel' is without any basis in as much as the OP1/defendant has

   been unable to show any document in support of the running of

   the hotel business. He has also not filed any family settlement to

   the effect that after the death of their late father it is the

   OP1/defendant who was allowed to run 'Gouttam Hotel'.

   The learned Trial Court noticed that vide Exbt C, which has been

admitted into evidence, the OP1/defendant has revealed the name as

Gautam Hotel and the trade licence and electricity bills stand in the

name of the petitioner/plaintiff. The electricity connection was in the

'Commercial' category.     In such view of the matter the story of the

OP1/defendant that he used to run the hotel is without any credence.

B) The examination-in-chief and cross-examination of one Amrit

   Gazmer (DW2) has revealed that neither the petitioner/plaintiff nor
    the OP1/defendant were given exclusive rights to run 'Gautam

   Hotel'. The learned Court further noticed that no document has

   been submitted by the PW1 to show that the construction in the

   suit premises was made by him. In his evidence PW1 has stated

   that in 1984 he was only 11 years old and the suit property was

   constructed by his father.       Moreover, the mutual agreement

   marked Exbts C also shows that the late Jagat Gazmer was in

   control of the family business in his capacity as 'Karta' of a Hindu

   Undivided family (HUF).
</p>
<p id="p_16">C) The learned Trial Court was of the considered view that from the

   evidence on record it can be inferred that the both the parties were

   in joint possession, both physical and constructive, over the suit

   property and neither the petitioner/plaintiff nor the OP1/defendant

   can claim to be the exclusive owner of the said property.

   The learned Trial Court, therefore, concluded that the property

remaining joint a suit for recovery of possession under <a href="/doc/1773715/" id="a_2">Section 6</a> of the

Specific Relief Act cannot lie and hence dismissed the suit.

   Aggrieved by the judgment and order of dismissal dated 30th April,

2013 the petitioner/plaintiff has filed the present application.

   Shri Angshuman Chakraborty, Learned Counsel appearing for the

petitioner/plaintiff has primarily argued that the learned Trial Court

has erred by denying recovery of possession in respect of the suit
 property which was also in possession of the petitioner/plaintiff.

Such property, even if considered to be joint, the right of the

petitioner/plaintiff to be put back in possession of the same after he

has been forcibly and illegally dispossessed cannot be curtailed.

   In support of his submission Shri Chakraborty relies upon the

following decisions:-
</p>
<p id="p_17">   19 CWN page 1117 in the matter of Atiman Bibi versus Seikh

Reasut.
</p>
<p id="p_18">   39 Calcutta Law Journal page 414 in the matter of

Kameswari Dasya versus Sishuram Deka and another.

   AIR 1968 Supreme Court page 620 in the matter of Lallu

Yeshwant Singh (dead) by his legal representative versus Rao

Jagdish singh and others.
</p>
<p id="p_19">   Shri Chakraborty points out that 19 CWN page 1117 is an

authority on the point that the object of <a href="/doc/1112600/" id="a_3">section 9</a> of the old <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_4">Specific

Relief Act</a> (1877) which is pari materia to <a href="/doc/1773715/" id="a_5">Section 6</a> of the present Act

is to provide an efficacious remedy in the class of cases where a

person in physical possession of property is forcibly dispossessed from

it against his will and consent. The main question for determination

is whether the plaintiff while in physical possession of the property

has been dispossessed of the same in the manner        specified in the

Section.
</p><p id="p_20">    The Court held that if the plaintiff was in physical possession he

can be restored to such possession under the decree of the Court.

The Court further held that a parcel in joint possession of immovable

property is as much in physical possession of his share as the entire

body of co-sharers in physical possession of the whole and such joint

possession can as well be physically restored in respect of his share as

the possession of the whole can be restored to the entire body of co-

sharers.
</p>
<p id="p_21">   In 39 CLJ page 414 a Three Judge Bench of this Hon'ble Court

held as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                    "It is an elementary principle that where joint owners
               have agreed to a mode of enjoyment of joint property, it
               is not open to one of them to disturb that arrangement
               without the consent of others: Durgacharan versus
               Khundkar.      It is not inconsistent with the fundamental
               principle that in Law each joint owner of an estate is
               regarded as having a joint proprietary right in the whole
               estate. That, however, is merely a right and must not be
               confounded with a manner of enjoying that right; It
               operates in strict Law to prevent a co-owner from setting
               of a claim to any parcel as his exclusive property during
               the continuance of the joint ownership, but where co-
               owners, by arrangement, either tacit or expresse, take up
               exclusive possession and enjoyment of parcels of the
               joint property, without such definition or severance of
               interest as would amount to partition, the Court will not
                   interfere with the arrangement at the instance of one co-
                  owner during tenure in common and will do so only in
                  partition so far as may be necessary to make an
                  equitable division of the property".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       Heard. Considered the materials on record.</blockquote><p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">       This Court finds substance in the argument advanced by Shri

Chakraborty relying on 19 CWN page 1117 on the point that where

a co-owner in physical possession of a joint property with other co-

sharers, if dispossessed by the latter, a suit for recovery of possession

under <a href="/doc/1773715/" id="a_6">Section 6</a> of the Specific Relief Act (Section 9 of the erstwhile

Act) shall lie.
</p>
<p id="p_24">       In the facts of the present case the Ld. Trial Court failed to

distinguish between the exclusive right, title and interest to the

property and its exclusive possession. In the considered view of this

Court the Ld. Trial Court did not notice the scope of <a href="/doc/1773715/" id="a_7">Section 6</a> of the

Specific Relief Act (Section 9 of the erstwhile Act) which protects

exclusive    possession      over    joint   property    without   requiring

determination of title.
</p>
<p id="p_25">       Following the ratio of the decision in 19 CWN page 1117

(supra) this Court is of the considered view that the Ld. Trial Court

ought to have applied the correct law to a proper appreciation of the

facts. In the further opinion of this Court while the Ld. Trial Court on

the one hand correctly held that "it is an established principle of law
 that the question of recovery of possession would arise only when one

party is dispossessed from the rightful possession", on the other hand

the Ld. Court ought to have noticed that from the pleadings and

evidence on record the plaintiff/petitioner had discharged the onus of

his exclusive possession over the property-in-suit.

</p><p id="p_26">      This Court, therefore, holds that the Ld. Trial Court erred in

dismissing the suit only on the ground that "the suit for recovery of

possession ipso facto does not lie because the property in dispute

remains a joint family property" inasmuch as the relief of recovery of

possession under <a href="/doc/1773715/" id="a_8">Section 6</a> of the Specific Relief Act is independent of

the defence of title which can be set up by way of separate suit.

</p><p id="p_27">      The order impugned dated 30th April, 2013 is accordingly set

aside. The matter is remanded back to the Ld. Trial Court to consider

the reliefs claimed in the suit in the light of the abovenoted

observations within a period of three months from the date of

communication of this order.
</p>
<p id="p_28">

</p><p id="p_29">      CO 2064 of 2013 is accordingly allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_30">      There will be, however, no order as to costs.
</p><p id="p_31">       Urgent Xerox certified photocopies of this judgment, if applied

for, be given to the parties upon compliance of all requisite formalities.
