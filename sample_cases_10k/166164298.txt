S.C.No.101/2012 PENDING BEFORE DIST. AND SESSIONS
                                2




JUDGE YADGIR, WHICH IS REGISTERED FOR THE OFFENCES
PUNISHABLE UNDER SECTIONS 143, 147, 148, 447, 326, 307,
504, 506, 149 OF <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>.

      THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THIS DAY THE
COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:


                          ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      This petition is filed seeking bail in Crime

No.47/2012      of    Gurumitkal      Police    Station,    Yadgir

District,    registered   on       22.04.2012     for      offences

punishable under <a href="/doc/1096965/" id="a_2">Sections 143</a>, <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_3">147</a>, <a href="/doc/763672/" id="a_4">148</a>, <a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_5">447</a>, <a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_6">326</a>,

<a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_7">307</a>, <a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_8">504</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_9">506</a> and <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_10">149</a> of IPC on the basis of complaint

of   one    Prakash     S/o   Hananayya        Kalal.      Injured

Hanamayya succumbed to the injuries and therefore,

police have added <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_11">Section 302</a> of IPC to the earlier FIR.

It is the case of the complainant that on 22.04.2012 in

the morning when the deceased was going along with

the village elders near the field in connection with the

dispute, accused have assaulted the deceased by means

of axe and clubs and caused grievous injuries, as a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               3</span>




result of which the deceased died. The specific overt-act

alleged against the petitioner is that he was holding an

axe in his hand and caused injuries both to the

deceased as well as Hanamayya.               The death is

homicidal.     Based on the aforesaid FIR, investigation

commenced and charge sheet has been filed and the

case has been committed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that

there is counter case in connection with the said

incident, which is registered as Crime No.48/2012 for

the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_12">Sections 323</a>, <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_13">324</a>, <a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_14">504</a>

read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_15">Section 34</a> of IPC against the complainant-

Prakash and two other accused, hence, he submits that

it is a free fight.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      3. Sri S.S.Aspalli, learned High Court Government

Pleader appearing for respondent - State, on the other

hand,     submits     that   this   petitioner   has   been

unsuccessful in securing bail before this Court twice i.e,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              4</span>




once in Criminal Petition No.16111/2012 which was

withdrawn by the learned counsel for the petitioner and

in    Criminal   Petition   No.15333/2013      which   was

dismissed by order dated 22.04.2013.       It is submitted

by him that no fresh grounds are made out to release

the petitioner on bail. Hence, petition may be rejected.


</p><p id="p_6">       4. I have perused the materials on record.      The

question as to whether Crime No.48/2012 is counter

case to Crime No.47/2012 has to be looked into during

the trial. Prima facie there is material to hold that the

petitioner has committed offence which is punishable

with death or imprisonment for life. Hence, petitioner is

not entitled for bail. Accordingly, petition is dismissed.


</p><p id="p_7">       The learned Sessions Judge is hereby directed to

dispose of the case expeditiously.
