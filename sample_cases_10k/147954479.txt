days i.e. more than five years.

the Reference Court has enhanced the compensation almost

12   times   without  there  being  any   material  on   record  to

justify such enhancement.  He submits that the delay was

because   files   had   to   move   from   table   to   table   and

decisions had to be taken by several authorities before

the appeals could actually be instituted.  He points out

that the certified copy of the Judgment and Award dated

31.3.2012     was   applied   for   on   13.8.2013   and   after   the

same was ready, the matter was referred to the office of

Government   Pleader   for   legal   opinion.     After   securing

such   opinion,   the   matter   was   referred   to   the   Joint

Secretary, Law and Judiciary Department, who recommended

filing   of   the   appeals   and   ultimately   on   24.9.2015,   the

papers were forwarded to the office of Government Pleader

and soon thereafter, the  Government Pleader prepared the

appeal papers.  However, there was some delay in securing

certified copies, Demand Drafts for Court fees and legal

expenses and therefore, the appeals alongwith application

for   condonation   of   delay   could   be   instituted   only   on

21.11.2017.     </p><pre id="pre_2">

that   in   such   matters,   the   length   of   delay   is   not

decision of the Supreme Court in the case of  <a href="/doc/1117226/" id="a_2">Collector

                  ]  to   submit that refusing to condone

delay can result in a meritorious matter being thrown out

at   the   very   threshold   and   cause   of   justice   being

defeated.  He submits that in case the delay is condoned,

at the highest the appeals can be decided on merits.  For

all   these   reasons,   Mr.Phule,   learned   AGP   submits   that

this is a  fit case for condonation of delay.

6)    Mr.R.D.Raut,   learned   counsel   for   the   respondents

</pre><p id="p_12">submits   that   the   delay   in   the   present   case   is   quite

inordinate and there is absolutely no explanation for the

same.   He   submits   that   the   applications   seeking

condonation of delay are quite vague and in all cases it

is  not sufficient merely to state that decisions had to

be taken at different levels and therefore, more time was

spent for filing the appeals.   He points out that there

are   no   details   in   the   Civil   Applications   and   the

explanation   offered   is   entirely   vague   and   can   never

constitute   sufficient   cause.     He   submits   that   the

respondents'   lands   have   been   acquired   and   it   is   quite

unjust and unfair that the compensation awarded in their

favour should be revisited at this point of time.   For

all these reasons, Mr.Raut, learned counsel submits that

these Civil Applications may be dismissed.  



</p><p id="p_13">7)    In order to appreciate the rival contentions, it is

necessary to make a reference to the cause as indicated




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">     ::: Uploaded on - 11/01/2018          ::: Downloaded on - 12/01/2018 00:54:07 :::</span>
                                    (6)           33-CA 15408 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

<p id="p_14">

in   the   Civil   Applications.     The   impugned   Judgment   and

Award was made on 31.3.2012 and the applicants admit that

the   certified   copy   was   applied   for   only   on   13.8.2013.

There is absolutely no explanation in the applications as

to why there was such inordinate delay in even applying

for   certified   copies   of   the   Judgment   and   Award,

particularly, since it is now the case of the applicants

that   there   was   manifold   increase   in   the   compensation

amount   awarded   by   the   Land   Acquisition   Officer.   The

statement that some time was spent to obtain opinion from

Assistant Government Pleader and Joint Secretary, Law and

Judiciary Department, is again, quite vague and backed by

no particulars.   In any case, the Officers are expected

to act within some reasonable period.  There is no point

in seeking condonation of delay virtually as a matter of

right   on   the   ground   that   the   Assistant   Government

Pleader's   office   or   the   Joint   Secretary,   Law   and

Judiciary Department, took some time to furnish a legal

opinion.

8)    In   this   case,   the   legal   opinion   and   recommendation

</pre><p id="p_16">for filing of appeal was taken on 24.9.2015.  Thereafter,

the   Office   of   the   Government   Pleader   also   prepared   the

appeal memos in the month of September 2015 itself.  The

appeals   and   applications   for   condonation   of   delay   are

instituted   on   22.11.2017.     Again,   the   delay   between

September 2015 and November 2017 is both inordinate and

unexplained.     The   vague   statement   that   the   memos   of

appeal   were   incomplete   or   that   the   Demand   Draft   for

payment   of   Court   fees   and   legal   expenses,   was   not

enclosed   alongwith   proposal   can   hardly     be   said   to

constitute  sufficient cause.  Inspite the delay being of

more than five years, the applications merely state that

there is 'some delay' in institution of appeals.  This is

hardly the proper manner to explain the delay. It is true

that every day's delay is not required to be explained.

However, that does not mean that delay which is of over

five years can be explained in such a casual manner.  In




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">     ::: Uploaded on - 11/01/2018           ::: Downloaded on - 12/01/2018 00:54:07 :::</span>

</p>
<p id="p_17">

such circumstances, it cannot be said that any sufficient

cause has been made out to condone the delay.   



</p><p id="p_18">9)    Normally,   the   applications   seeking   condonation   of

delay   are   liberally   considered.     This   is   more   so   when

impersonal   agency   like   the   Government   or   Public   Sector

Acquiring   Bodies are concerned.   Mr.Phule, learned AGP

is quite right in his submission that quantum of delay is

not decisive but it is the quality of explanation, which

determines the matter.  In the present case, the quality

of explanation is simply lacking.   On the basis of the

vague   pleadings   of   procedural   delay,   it   will   not   be

appropriate to condone such inordinate delay of over five

years in instituting all the appeals.

<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">10) Ultimately, the plight of the land losers cannot be

totally forgotten.     They have lost their lands several

years   ago.     They   have   been   litigating   to   secure   some

compensation, since according to them, what was awarded




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">     ::: Uploaded on - 11/01/2018           ::: Downloaded on - 12/01/2018 00:54:07 :::</span>

</p>
<p id="p_21">

by   the   Land   Acquisition   Officer   was   mere   pittance.

Despite the determination by the reference Court, almost

five   years   ago,   as   pointed   out   by   learned   counsel   for

respondents,   the   enhanced   compensation   has   not   infact

been paid to the land losers.  There is no clarity as to

whether   the   land   losers   have   levied   execution   or   not.

Learned   counsel   for   respondents   submits   that   in   most

cases, the land losers have no means to levy execution,

since,   the   experience   has   shown   that   the   mighty   State

which   has   acquired   their   lands   is   often   successful   in

delaying the execution process as well.  Respondents have

thus   suffered   enough   prejudice   on   account   of   denial   of

enhanced   compensation   despite   the   award   made   by   the

reference   Court   almost   five   years   ago.     To   permit   the

applicant   at   this   stage   to   re-visit   the   issue   of

compensation   and   that   too,   without   there   being   any

sufficient cause shown to explain the inordinate delay,

will only amount to grant of undeserved indulgence to the

applicant,   in   the   facts   and   circumstances   of   the   case.

</p>
<p id="p_23">

The possibility of these appeals having been instituted

only   to   seek   some  ex-post   facto  justification   for   non-

payment   of   enhanced   compensation   to   the   land   losers,

cannot be ruled out.  In such circumstances, it will not

be   appropriate   to   exercise   discretion   in   favour   of   the

the applicant to demonstrate good faith before claiming

exercise of discretion.   The decision, no doubt, states

that the length of delay is not decisive but the quality

of   explanation   is   the   determinative   factor.     In   this

case,   quality   of   explanation   is   too   poor   to   constitute

any   sufficient   cause.    Mst.   Katiji  (supra),   no   doubt,

absolves explanation of each day's delay.   However, the

observation does not mean that delay of over five years

is to be condoned as a matter of routine in the absence

of any sufficient cause.

an   impersonal   agency,   which   is   required   to   act   through

its officers.  The statements that files had to be moved

from table to table or that pressure of work or that some

taken at different levels are reasons too vague to merit

there being any proper explanation of such delay on the

ground of involvement of public revenue.  This serves no

entitled   to   certain   amount   of   latitude   but   the   law   of
