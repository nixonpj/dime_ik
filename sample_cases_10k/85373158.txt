      Shri K. N. Gupta, learned Senior Counsel alongwith Shri
Rajendra Dhakar, Shri Prashant Sharma, Shri D.S. Raghuwanshi
and Shri Jitendra Sharma, Advocates for the petitioners.
      Shri Vishal Mishra, learned Counsel alongwith Shri Anil
Sharma, Shri Shashank Indapurkar, Shri RBS Tomar and Shri
Jha, Advocates for the alleged respondents-contemnors.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard.
</p><p id="p_2">1.    Vide order dated 12.05.2017, which has been brought on
record by the respondents-contemors, they have accepted that
teaching and non-teaching employees of the petitioners-
Institutions shall be absorbed in respective local bodies in terms
of the order dated 21.03.2002 issued by the State Government.
This Court had earlier noted vide order dated 07.04.2017 that
the cut off date of absorption will be 21.03.2002 and that has
been accepted by the respondents. Therefore, all the benefits
of absorption including pay fixation and revision of pay made
from time to time will be applicable from 21.03.2002.
</p><p id="p_3">2.    Two disputes have been raised by the learned counsel for
the petitioners; one that these petitioners have been absorbed
in the local bodies whereas the order dated 21.03.2002
required them to be taken by the State Government. This
controversy in fact stood resolved vide order dated 13.03.2007
passed in WP No.5306/2005 (S) : <a href="/doc/4086425/" id="a_1">Ram Bahadur Singh
Bhadauriya v. State of MP &amp; Others</a>, wherein the Hon'ble
Court was pleased to accord liberty to the State Government to
pass appropriate orders with regard to absorption of the staff
members and teachers of the School in pursuance to the
directions issued by the Government as per the circulars of the
State Government dated 11.11.2003 and 21.03.2002 and other
circulars issued by the State Government in this regard, as per
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            2</span>
Conc. Cases No.138/12, 690/12, 418/15, 432/15,
436/15, 441/15, 445/15, 491/15, 492/15, 549/15,
              562/15 and 124/16.
</p>
<p id="p_4">law. In the circular dated 11.11.2003, it is clearly mentioned
that the services of the employees are to be absorbed in the
concerned local bodies and therefore the first objection, as has
been raised by the petitioners, is not sustainable and is hence
overruled.
</p><p id="p_5">3.    Next issue, which has been raised by the learned counsel
for the petitioners is that in the impugned order dated
12.05.2017 (Annexure C/1), it has been mentioned that non-
teaching staff will be paid wages as applicable to the skilled
labourers on Collector rate w.e.f. 2013. This date 2013 is
arbitrary and has no basis inasmuch as once even the non-
teaching staff has been absorbed in the local bodies on
contract basis w.e.f. 21.03.2002, then they will be entitled to
contract salary as revised from time to time w.e.f. 21.03.2002
and this cut off date 2013 is arbitrary.
</p><p id="p_6">4.    Shri Vishal Mishra, learned counsel for the respondents-
contemnors submits that in para 4 of the order dated
12.05.2017, it is clearly mentioned that they are given
appointment on contract rates in the local bodies w.e.f.
21.03.2002. Since they have been given appointment on
contract basis in the local bodies w.e.f. 21.03.2002, the date for
entitlement for emoluments is inbuilt in this para 4 itself and it
will be 21.03.2002 only. Therefore, this Court clarifies that even
the non-teaching staff of the Schools, which have been taken
over, will be entitled to contract salary as revised from time to
time w.e.f. 21.03.2002 and not w.e.f. 2013 as has been sought
to be clarified by the respondents in a very crafty manner in
the last para of the impugned order that the date of payment
of wages on Collector rate applicable to skilled labourers will
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>
       Conc. Cases No.138/12, 690/12, 418/15, 432/15,
       436/15, 441/15, 445/15, 491/15, 492/15, 549/15,
                     562/15 and 124/16.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       be 21.03.2002 and the revisions made thereafter and not 2013.
       Shri Vishal Mishra undertakes to get this rectified within a
       period of 15 days from today and on such undertaking, these
       contempt petitions stand disposed of with the following
       directions :-
</p><p id="p_8">       1)     As has been admitted by the respondents, the date of
       absorption of both the teaching and non-teaching staff will be
       21.03.2002; and
</p><p id="p_9">       2)     Non-teaching staff will be entitled to payment of wages
       as are applicable to all the contract employees from time to
       time w.e.f. 21.03.2002 and the revisions so made thereafter.
</p><p id="p_10">       5.     Shri Prashant Sharma, learned counsel submits that this
       is only an order on papers to avoid contempt, and benefits
       have not yet been extended to the concerned employees.
       Nonetheless it is expected that once the orders have been
       passed in principle and the respondents' counsel has admitted
       that the very date of absorption has been treated as
       21.03.2002, then all the consequential benefits alongwith
       arrears will follow within a reasonable time, which this Court
       hopes and trusts that the same will be paid within three
       months from today, if not already paid, including pay fixation
       on the post of Adhyapak to the teaching faculty.
</p><p id="p_11">       6.     Accordingly, contempt proceedings are dropped in terms
       of the undertaking of Shri Vishal Mishra, Advocate.
</p><p id="p_12">              Certified copy as per rules.</p><pre id="pre_2">
