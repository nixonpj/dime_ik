HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD
 
 

?Court No. - 73
 

 
Case :- CRIMINAL MISC. BAIL APPLICATION No. - 56046 of 2019
 

 
Applicant :- Viri Singh
 
Opposite Party :- State of U.P.
 
Counsel for Applicant :- Rajat Kumar Shukla
 
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
 

 
Hon'ble Sanjay Kumar Singh,J.
</pre> 
<p id="p_1">Heard learned counsel for the applicant, learned Additional Government Advocate representing the State and perused the record of the case. 
</p> 
<p id="p_2">By means of this application, the applicant, who is involved in Case Crime No. 165 of 2019, under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_1">Sections 420</a>, <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_2">406</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_3">467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_4">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_5">471</a> and <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_6">120-B</a> IPC, police station Sadar Bazar, district Mathura, is seeking enlargement on bail during the trial. 
</p> 
<p id="p_3">It is submitted by learned counsel for the applicant that the main allegation against the applicant is that he had executed an agreement to sell dated 5.3.2008 in favour of informant after taking sale consideration of an amount of Rs. 3,00,000/- (rupees three lac only) in cash, but the applicant had again executed a sale deed dated 23.11.2010 in favour of one M/s Karmyogi Kuteer Private Limited and did not execute sale deed in favour of the informant. 
</p> 
<p id="p_4">On the said fact, the main substratum of argument of learned counsel for the applicant is that in agreement to sell dated 5.3.2008 one of the condition was that the sale deed shall be executed within twelve months, but the informant did not get the sale deed executed within the prescribed time period in his favour. It is again submitted that the informant has also not filed any suit for specific performance pursuant to agreement to sell dated 5.3.2008 claiming his right, and subsequently, impugned first information report has been lodged by the informant after much delay on 20.5.2019 against the applicant as well as all those persons to whom applicant has subsequently sold the land. It is again urged that there is no dispute about the ownership of the land. It is contended by learned counsel for the applicant that the applicant is absolutely innocent and has falsely been implicated in the present case with some ulterior motive. It is next contended that there is no chance of the applicant of fleeing away from the judicial process or tampering with the prosecution evidence. It is also submitted that the applicant has no criminal antecedent to his credit and is facing detention since 17.11.2019. Learned counsel for the applicant lastly submitted that if the applicant is released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail and will cooperate in the early disposal of the case.
</p> 
<p id="p_5">Per contra learned A.G.A. has opposed the bail prayer of the applicant by contending that the innocence of the applicant cannot be adjudged at pre trial stage therefore, the applicant does not deserve any indulgence. In case the applicant is released on bail he will misuse the liberty of bail.
</p> 
<p id="p_6">Keeping in view the nature of the offence, evidence, complicity of the accused, submissions of the learned counsel for the parties, I am of the view that the applicant has made out a fit case for bail. Hence, the bail application is hereby allowed. 
</p> 
<p id="p_7">Let the applicant, Viri Singh be released on bail in the aforesaid case crime number on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned with the following conditions which are being imposed in the interest of justice:- 
</p> 
<p id="p_8">i) The applicant will not tamper with prosecution evidence and will not harm or harass the victim/complainant in any manner whatsoever. 
</p> 
<p id="p_9">ii) The applicant will abide the orders of court, will attend the court on every date and will not delay the disposal of trial in any manner whatsoever. 
</p> 
<p id="p_10">(iii) The applicant will not indulge in any unlawful activities. 
</p> 
<p id="p_11">(iv) The applicant will not misuse the liberty of bail in any manner whatsoever. 
</p> 
<p id="p_12">The identity, status and residential proof of sureties will be verified by court concerned and in case of breach of any of the conditions mentioned above, court concerned will be at liberty to cancel the bail and send the applicant to prison. 
</p> 
<p id="p_13">It is clarified that anything said in this order is limited to the purpose of determination of this bail application and will in no way be construed as an expression on the merits of the case. It is further clarified that the trial court shall be absolutely free to arrive at its independent conclusions on the basis of evidence led unaffected by anything said in this order. 
</p> 
<p id="p_14">Order Date :- 17.12.2019
