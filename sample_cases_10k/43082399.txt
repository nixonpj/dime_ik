<p id="p_1">                 (Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAKESH KUMAR)

8   13-09-2018                  In all the three appeals, appellants were tried together

                  and convicted by a common judgment and , as such, all the three

                  appeals were taken up together under the heading "For Orders"

                  for considering the prayer for suspension of sentence and

                  granting bail.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                               Earlier, the appeals were admitted and lower court

                  record was called for. Subsequently, in view of judgment of

                  Hon'ble Supreme Court reported (2014) 9 SCC 177 (<a href="/doc/83145849/" id="a_1">Atul

                  Tripathi vs State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Ors</a>.), learned State

                  counsels were asked to file objection to the prayer for

                  suspension of sentence and granting bail to the appellants. In

                  complaince with the said order, in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 104 of

                  2018, an objection has been filed on behalf of the

                  get any instruction for filing objection to the prayer for bail.

                      All the appellants were convicted for commission of

         offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">34</a>, <a href="/doc/1128948/" id="a_4">120</a> (B) of the Indian Penal

         Code and 27 of the <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_5">Arms Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                      Learned counsel for the appellants have argued that

         the case is completely based on circumstantial evidence, since

         there was no ocular evidence to the occurrence. It has been

         highlighted that the alleged occurrence had taken place at about

         8:30 AM in village Parsauni within the district of Sitamarhi and

         from the place of occurrence, a mobile call was given to the

         brother of the deceased, who at that time was staying at Delhi.

         After receiving such information, the brother from Delhi gave a

         call to his residence in Sitamarhi regarding the occurrence.

         Thereafter, informant and other family members proceeded for

         the place of occurrence. At the place of occurrence, it was

         alleged, as if, all the appellants were present there. Thereafter,

         the injured was carried to hospital, however he was declared

         dead.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                      Learned counsel for the appellants submits that

         though there was no evidence, the police subsquently came out

         with a case ,as if , two appellants made confessional statement

         and disclosed their involvement as well as involvement of other

         appellants in the case. The said confession had also led to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            4/6</span>




         recovery of country-made pistol and one knife from the house of

         appellant Rajesh Kumar. It has been argued that the weapons,

         which were allegedly shown to be recovered, though were sent

         to Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) for chemical examination,

         there is no report to corroborate the fact that the said weapons

         were used in the crime or not. It has also been argued by the

         learned counsel for the appellants that it is improbable that after

         committing murder, for such a long time, all accused persons at

         the place of occurrence were waiting for the family members of

         deceased. It has been argued that some of the witnesses,

         particularly wife of the deceased had disclosed that the deceased

         in injured condition had telephonically informed regarding

         involvement of accused persons. It has been argued by the

         learned counsel for the appellants that if appellants had

         committed crime and, thereafter, they remained present with the

         injured, in that situation it is completely improbable that

         appellants would have allowed the injured to give a mobile call

         to his wife and disclose the name of the appellants. It has also

         been argued that the person, who had recorded confession, has

         not stated that he had gone to search articles and recover the

         same.

         Ashhar Mustafa, learned counsel for the informant have

         vehemently opposed the prayer for suspension of sentence and

         granting bail. It has been argued that once first court on fact has

         held guilty this Court, while exercising power under <a href="/doc/985477/" id="a_6">Section 389</a>

         of Code of Criminal Procedure, may not allow the prayer for

         suspension of sentence and granting bail. Sri Ajay Mishra,

         learned Addl. Public Prosecutor has also referred to facts

         disclosed in the show-cause.

<p id="p_7">                      Besides hearing learned counsel for the parties, we

         have also cursorily examined the material on record and after

         going through the same, it is evident that case is completely

         based on circumstantial evidence and , as such, at the moment, it

         would be necessary to pass favourable order.
