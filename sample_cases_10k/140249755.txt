             Dated this the 26th day of July, 2018


                            JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     This writ petition is filed by the petitioner seeking to

quash Ext.P7 order passed by the 2 nd respondent dated

03.02.2018, declining permission for utilization of the property

for construction or other purposes, as per Sec.6 of the Kerala

Land Utilization Order, 1967, on the ground that petitioner has

proceeded with the utilization for other purposes without

securing permission from the 2nd respondent, and for other

related reliefs.   Material facts for the disposal of the writ

petition are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.    Petitioner herein is the owner in possession and

enjoyment of an extent of 5 cents of land situate in Survey

No.59/2A of Mananthavady Village of Wayanad District. It was

lying as a converted land and is not suitable for agricultural

purposes, even though it is recorded in the revenue records as

well as BTR as 'Nilam'. It is further submitted that, the land in

question is not included in the data bank prepared as per the

provisions of the Act, 2008.           Thereupon, petitioner has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C) No.6118 of 2018                   2</span>

submitted an application under the Kerala Land Utilization

Order, before the 2nd respondent, seeking utilization of the land

for different purposes other than paddy cultivation.                          The

Village Officer as well as the Agricultural Officer, after

inspection of the property, recommended for grant of permit,

under      Clause    6,   to   the   Sub           Collector,    Mananthavady.

However, the Sub Collector in turn rejected the same, stating

that, there is a basement seen in the property of the petitioner

and     carried     out   construction        activities      without    securing

permission.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.     The 2nd respondent has filed a detailed counter

affidavit, refuting the allegations and claims and demands

raised by the petitioner.        The possession of property by the

petitioner, submission of the application etc. are all admitted.

Among       other    contentions,    it       is     stated     that,   petitioner

approached the Agricultural Officer, Mananthavady with an

application dated 08.05.2017 for conversion of the land for

construction of a residential building. The Agricultural Officer

and the Tahsildar reported to the Sub Collector that the said

land is already converted, and also that it is unsuitable for

paddy cultivation.        The Agricultural Officer, Mananthavady, in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C) No.6118 of 2018             3</span>

clear variation to Tahsildar's report, in his report bearing

No.34/17-18 reported that a foundation was constructed in the

land in question.     Consequently, another report was sought

from Tahsildar and vide a letter dated 30.11.2017, 4 th

respondent      Tahsildar,   duly   submitted   a   report   dated

11.01.2018, that no foundation was seen in the land during his

site inspection, and the construction works took place after his

inspection.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     4.       It is further submitted that, prior sanction is

required for the conversion of a land, as per Clause 6 of the

Kerala Land Utilization Order, 1967.       However, the petitioner

had commenced the house construction works on the land in

question without obtaining the permission of the authorities

concerned. Hence, it is illegal and no provisions are available

for regularization of the same.         Moreover, the Government

made it clear that the regularization of the constructions made

without prior sanction could be dealt with very seriously.

Therefore, according to the 2nd respondent, Ext.P7 order

passed by the 2nd respondent is not suffering from any

arbitrariness or illegality, liable to be interfered with by this

Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C) No.6118 of 2018           4</span>

</p><p id="p_5">      5.   I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner and

the   learned   Senior    Government    Pleader.     Perused   the

documents on record and the pleadings put forth by the

respective parties.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6.   The sole question to be considered is, whether

Ext.P7 order passed by the 2nd respondent is liable to be

interfered with. It is evident from Ext.P7 that, petitioner has

carried out certain construction activities without securing

permission as per clause 6(2) of the Kerala Land Utilization

Order, 1967.    However, from Ext.P7 as well as the counter

affidavit filed by the 2nd respondent, it is clear and evident that

no major constructions were carried out, even assuming that

constructions were carried out by the petitioner without

securing permission.      It is evident from Rule 6 (xiii) of the

Kerala Municipality Building Rules, 1999, that, an application

for a development permit shall be accompanied by site plan,

service plan, together with details specified thereunder, and

the area and      location of any paddy fields and/or other

agricultural land that are proposed to be reclaimed and/or

converted for the said development or re-development.           So

also, as per Rule 6(1) of the Kerala Panchayat Building Rules,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(C) No.6118 of 2018                   5</span>

2011,      an    application    for   development           permit   shall   be

accompanied by site plan, service plan, together with details

and specifications as described thereunder, and in the case of

lands proposed to be excavated, filled up or reclaimed,

necessary clearance (from the authority concerned) shall also

be accompanied.           Therefore, the rule makes it explicit and

clear that, even if any construction is carried out in the

property without securing permission under the provisions of

the   Kerala       Land     Utilization       Order,   1967,    by   securing

appropriate        orders    from     the       statutory     authority,     the

development permit application can be considered by the

Secretary of the Panchayat/ Municipality.

</p><p id="p_7">      7.        In that view of the matter, the stand adopted by the

2nd respondent in Ext.P7 that already a construction is carried

out without securing permission, cannot be sustained at all.

That apart, the enquiry contemplated under clause 6(2) of the

Kerala Land Utilization Order, is to ascertain whether the

agricultural activity like the paddy cultivation can be continued

within the property in question, the nature and development of

the adjoining properties and whether the permission granted

would affect any eco-system or agricultural activities etc. etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(C) No.6118 of 2018           6</span>

However, the 2nd respondent has not undertaken any such

enquiry.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       8.    In that view of the matter, I am of the considered

opinion that, Ext.P7 suffers from the vice of arbitrariness and

illegality liable to be interfered with by this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article

226</a> of the Constitution of India. Accordingly, I quash Ext.P7

and direct the 2nd respondent to re-consider the application

submitted by the petitioner, at the earliest, and at any rate,

within two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this

judgment, after verifying the authenticity of the submission

that the petitioner is not included in the data bank constituted

as per the provisions of the Kerala Paddy land and Wet land

Act, 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       The writ petition is allowed to the above extent.
