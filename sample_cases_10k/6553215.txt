<p id="p_1">              In the  present case, charge for the offence  punishable 

Under   <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_2">Section 135</a> of the Indian Electricity Act, 2003 was framed

company   inspected  the  premises   of   accused, Dhan Singh S/o Sh. 
</p><p id="p_2">                                      ­2­



Rishal   Singh,   R/o   F1/409­410,   Sultan   Puri,   Delhi,   within   the 

jurisdiction of PS Sultan Puri and the said team found that he was 

indulged   in   direct   theft   of   electricity   by   tapping   illegally   directly 

from   service   cable   by   making   hole   at   the   meter   box   directly 

connected to the inspected meter, outgoing found disconnected. At 

the time of inspection, a load of 1.288 KW was found connected for 

domestic   purpose   by   direct   theft   and   he   thereby   caused   wrongful 

gain to himself and wrongful loss to the complainant company i.e. 

NDPL.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.             Accused pleaded not guilty to the charge and claimed a 

trial.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.             Prosecution  has   examined  one   witness,   namely,  PW1, 

Sh. A.K. Gupta to prove the allegations against the accused.

</p><p id="p_5">4.             PW1,   Sh.   A.K.   Gupta,   has   deposed   that   he   is  the 

authorised representative of the complainant company i.e. NDPL in 

the present case. He has further deposed that the accused, namely, 

Dhan   Singh   has   settled   the   matter   in   the   present   case   with   the 

complainant company and he has made payment of Rs.13,000/­ to 

the AR of the complainant company i.e. NDPL, towards the full and 

final settlement regarding the bill in question of Rs.16,935/­ bearing 

EAC  No. 55610.  He has further deposed that the accused has settled 
                                      ­3­



the  civil  liability  and  has  made  payment  of  the  said   amount  of 

Rs.13,000/­ towards the full and final settlement. He has deposed that 

the complainant  company  i.e.  NDPL  does  not  want to pursue the 

case any more.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.            In   view   of   the   evidence   of   PW­1,   Sh.   A.K.   Gupta, 

statement of the accused U/s 313 Cr. P.C has been dispensed with. 

</p><p id="p_7">6.            I have heard the arguments on behalf of both the parties 

and have gone through the record file carefully.

</p><p id="p_8">7.            It   is   well   settled   preposition   of   criminal   law   that 

prosecution   has   to   establish   its   case   against   the   accused   beyond 

reasonable doubt.   Reference in this connection can be made to the 

decision of Supreme Court in, Tika Vs. State of UP,  AIR 1974 SC 

155, wherein it has been held that­

                      One of the cardinal principles which has always to 

                      be kept in view, in our system of administration of 

                      justice  for  criminal  cases,  is  that  an  accused  

                      is   presumed   to   be   innocent,   unless,   that  

                      presumption  is  rebutted  by  the  prosecution  by 

                      production of evidence  which  may  show him to 

                      be guilty of the offence with which he is charged.

</p><p id="p_9">8.            In the case  in  hand,   on   the  basis  of  inspection dated 
                               ­4­



29.01.09,  complainant  company  raised  a  bill  against  the  accused 

Dhan Singh and the accused has made payment of Rs.13,000/­ to the 

complainant   company   i.e.   NDPL,   towards   the   full   and   final 

settlement   regarding   the   bill     in     question   of   Rs.16,935/­   bearing 

EAC   No.55610.     It   is   clear   from   the   evidence   of   PW1   Sh.   A.K. 

Gupta, that the accused has made payment of Rs.13,000/­ towards the 

full and final settlement regarding the bill in question of Rs.16,935/­. 

Now, no grievance is left against the accused, namely, Dhan Singh, 

so far as the cause of action of the present case is concerned. The 

accused, namely,  Dhan Singh  has satisfied his civil liabilities with 

the   complainant   company   i.e.   NDPL.     Since,   the   accused   has 

satisfied his civil liability with the complainant company, no fruitful 

purpose will be served by imposing any criminal penalty upon the 

accused. Accordingly, the accused, namely, Dhan Singh is acquitted 

of   the   offence   punishable   U/s   135   of   the   <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_3">Electricity   Act</a>,   2003. 

Further,   the   accused   is   not   entitled   to   claim  the   amount   of 

Rs.13,000/­ which has been paid by him towards the fulfillment of 

his civil liability.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.             Accused, Dhan Singh is on bail in this case. His personal 

bond and surety bond are cancelled.  His surety is discharged.
