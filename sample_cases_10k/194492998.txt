        Pawan Kumar Dubey v. State of MP and Ors.

 ( <a href="/doc/133074682/" id="a_2">Harnarayan Pandoriya and Ors vs. State of M.P and
                        Ors</a>.)

Gwalior dated; 11.09.2019
        Shri D.S. Raghuvanshi, Advocate for the petitioners.
        Shri   Puroshottam    Pandey     Govt.   Advocate      for   the
respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">        Ms. Sonal Mittal, Advocate for respondent no. 6.
        The issue involved in these writ petitions being identical and
almost similar, therefore, these writ petitions are dealt with and
decided by this common order.
</p><p id="p_2">2.      The facts in W.P. No. 23059/2018 are as under:-
</p><p id="p_3">3.      The present petition has been filed challenging the the order
dated     12.9. 2018 passed by         Chief Executive Officer, Zila
Panchayat, Morena       whereby the alleged FIR has been lodged
against the petitioner. It is alleged that the aforesaid direction has
been issued on the basis of ex-parte report submitted by the Sub-
Divisional Officer wherein without finding anything against the
petitioner and without there being any jurisdiction possessed by the
Sub-Divisional Officer, he has made enquiry into the matter, and
FIR against the petitioner was got registered.
</p><p id="p_4">4.       It is alleged that the aforesaid action on the part of the
respondent is contrary, illegal and arbitrary      and is against the
natural justice and fair play. It is alleged that petitioner was holding
the post of Gram Rozgar Sahayak in Gram Panchayat, Chhinwara,
Janpad Panchayat Pahargarh and affidavit was got constructed
             HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>

behind the back of the petitioner with respect to construction of
work under the MNREGS in pursuance to the policy introduced by
the Government. It was required that muster roll should be created
on line and Sub-Engineer was required to verify the work and
approval of Assistant Engineer was required then file was required to
move to the Chief Executive Officer of Janpad Panchayat and after
taking approval from CEO, the payment was required to be made by
the Account Officer.
</p><p id="p_5">5.    The entire system has been introduced for the transparent
working of the system. In the present case       certain works under
MNREGS were undertaken          but after conclusion of the work the
Sarpanch has denied the signature and complaints were made to
the various level to the effect that one Sikarwar and Panchayat
Secretary Bhupendra Singh Tomar in collusion have made forged
signatures on the muster roll and accordingly an enquiry was got
conducted into the matter. It is submitted that until and unless all
signatures were examined by the handwriting expert no drafts can
be issued. He has drawn attention of this court to Annexure P/3, the
report submitted by the Chief Executive Officer. On the basis of the
aforesaid    report letter impugned has been       written   by Chief
Executive Officer, Zila Panchayat         Morena to CEO, Janpad
Panchayat, Pahargarh to take appropriate steps for registration of
FIR against the petitioner. It is alleged by the petitioner that entire
enquiry has been done behind the back of the petitioner. No notice
was served and no opportunity of hearing was granted prior to
passing of the impugned order. Accordingly, he has prayed           for
quashment of the impugned order.
</p><p id="p_6">6.    Counsel for the petitioner has drawn attention of this court to
order dated 6.10. 2018 passed by co-ordinate bench of this court in
W.P. No. 22930/2018 (<a href="/doc/123044614/" id="a_3">Bhupendra Singh Tomar vs. State of M.P</a>.)
wherein under similar facts and circumstances co-ordinate bench
has disposed of the writ petition.

</p><p id="p_8">7.      He has prayed for disposal of the writ petition in the similar
fashion.
</p><p id="p_9">8.      Per contra, counsel appearing for the State as well as the
counsel for respondent no. 6 could not dispute the fact regarding
passing of the order dated 6.10. 2018 by a co-ordinate bench of this
court      and has agreed for disposal of the writ petition in similar
manner. They have further stated that     the order dated 6.10. 2018
passed in similar facts and circumstances of the case as that of the
present case and order applies to the petitioner's case mutatis
matandis.
</p><p id="p_10">9.      Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
</p><p id="p_11">10.     From the     enquiry report conducted by the Sub-Divisional
Officer and on the basis of the report submitted to CEO a letter has
been issued dated 12.9. 2018 wherein a direction has been issued by
the CEO, Zila Panchayat, Morena to CEO Janpad Panchayat,
Pahargarh for registration of the FIR against petitioner. In the order
dated 6.10. 2018 letter dated 12.09. 2018 written by CEO Zila
Panchayat was put to challenge. Thus, from the record, it is seen
that there is no difference in the facts and circumstances of the
present case as to the case of Bhupendra Singh Tomar (supra).
Thus the present petition is also disposed of in similar manner as
disposed by the co-ordinate bench of this court. The relevant
paragraphs read as as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           6. However, it would be appropriate to direct that
           the direction contained in annexure P-1 issued by
           CEO, Zila Panchayat Morena shall not be taken
           as binding upon the competent police authority
           while deciding on the question of registration of
           offence u/S 154 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>. The police authority is
           expected to act in a free and fair manner without
           being influenced by the said directions vide
           annexure P-1 or by any other influence except the
           information supplied to the police which if
           discloses commission of cognizable offence then
           and only then the offence may be registered and

                 not otherwise.

                 raised by the learned counsel for petitioner.
