HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD
 
 

?Chief Justice's Court
 

 
Case :- CRIMINAL APPEAL No. - 1169 of 1979
 

 
Appellant :- Lala Ram And Others
 
Respondent :- State Of U.P.
 
Counsel for Appellant :- I.N. Mulla
 
Counsel for Respondent :- D.G.A.
 

 
Hon'ble Govind Mathur,Chief Justice
 
Hon'ble Vivek Varma,J.
</pre> 
<p id="p_1">This appeal is preferred to assail correctness of the judgment dated 31st March, 1979 passed by learned IVth Additional District &amp; Sessions Judge, Bareilly in Sessions Trial No.189 of 1978. The learned trial court by the judgment impugned recorded conviction of the appellants Lala Ram, Bhoop Ram, Madan Lal and Mohar Singh for an offence punishable under Section 302 read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_1">Section 34</a> Indian Penal Code and awarded sentence to undergo imprisonment for life term.
</p> 
<p id="p_2">During pendency of the appeal, the appellants Lala Ram, Bhoop Ram and Madan Lal died and this fact has been verified by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bareilly. The appeal stands abated against the accused named above. The only surviving accused now is Mohar Singh, the appellant no.4.
</p> 
<p id="p_3">By an order dated 9th July, 2008, this Court ordered as under:-
</p> 
<p id="p_4">"In this case, a report has been received from the District and Sessions Judge, Bareilly dated 13.12.2007 that in the fire which took place near the Record room in 1979, all the records in the office were burnt and it was not possible reconstruct the same.
</p> 
<p id="p_5">In this view of the matter, the learned Sessions Judge, Bareilly is now directed that if the basic documents of this case are available then as observed by the Apex Court in the case of State of U.P. Vs. Abhay Raj Singh, AIR 2004, SC 3235 steps be taken for retrial of the case.
</p> 
<p id="p_6">List this case after four months along with the compliance report of the Sessions Judge, Bareilly."
</p> 
<p id="p_7">In compliance of the order aforesaid, the District Judge, Bareilly made efforts to have retrial in the matter but no basic document then was available. Accordingly, by a letter dated 26th August, 2008, he conveyed to this Court that being no basic document available, it would not be possible to undertake retrial as per order dated 9th July, 2008.
</p> 
<p id="p_8">Though the letter aforesaid received by this Court much back in the year 2008, but nothing substantial has taken place subsequent thereto.
</p> 
<p id="p_9">In absence of the basic documents, it is impossible to reconstruct record of the case, as a matter of fact, we are having no other document except judgment passed by the trial court on 31st March, 1979 and nothing else.
</p> 
<p id="p_10">In absence of record, it is not possible for us to adjudicate this appeal on merits. The incident too relates to the month of October, 1977. A period of about 42 years has already been passed from the date of incident and about 40 years from the date of the pronouncement of the judgment by the trial court.
</p> 
<p id="p_11">In the circumstances noticed above, while relying upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Uttar Pradesh Vs. Abhay Raj Singh reported in (2004) 4 SCC 6, we deem it appropriate to set aside the order passed by the trial court by setting aside the conviction recorded and the sentence awarded.
</p> 
<p id="p_12">Order accordingly.
</p> 
<p id="p_13">Order Date :- 23.9.2019
 
Bhaskar
 
(Vivek Varma, J.) (Govind Mathur, C.J.)
