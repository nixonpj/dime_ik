                  W.P.(C).No.31443 of 2009 - O
                   ---------------------------------
             Dated this the 6th day of November, 2009

                           J U D G M E N T

<p id="p_1">      Petitioner has filed an indigent O.P as O.P.No.14 of 2009 on

the file of the Sub Court, Pathanamthitta.           He stood as a

guarantor for availing a loan by the fourth defendant from the

first respondent bank. He also mortgaged his property having an

extent of 8.8 Ares to secure the loan extended by the bank to the

fourth defendant.       Proceedings were initiated by the first

respondent/bank issuing notice under Section 13(2) of the

Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and

<a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_1">Enforcement of Security Interest Act</a>. Petitioner approached the

Sub Court, Pathanamthitta and filed the above petition seeking to

sue as an indigent person disputing his liability to the bank

contending that because of the omissions and defaults committed

primary security given by the debtor had been lost and thereby

he has suffered severe damages. In the application he moved an

interlocutory petition for injunction.     The court below initially

granted an order of injunction exparte, but, later, after the first

W.P.(C).No.31443 of 2009 - O

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 2</span>

respondent bank appeared and filed objections, hearing both

sides, the interim injunction was vacated. Though he has applied

for getting a carbon copy of the order dismissing his application

for interim injunction, it has not been furnished till date and the

bank is taking hasty steps to proceed against the property, is the

grievance espoused in the writ petition for issue of appropriate

directions/orders to the court below for supplying copy of the

order passed in his application and also for a restrictive order

against the bank from proceedings against his property.

</p><p id="p_2">      2.   First respondent bank has entered appearance through

counsel. I heard the counsel on both sides.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.   At the time of hearing, learned counsel for the

petitioner confined his submissions for seeking for a grace period

to prefer an appeal against the order passed by the court below

dismissing his application for interim injunction and till then

continuance of the order of injunction that had been passed by

the court below, but, subsequently vacated on dismissal of his

application.   Having regard to the facts and circumstances

involved, I direct the court below to issue copy of the order

W.P.(C).No.31443 of 2009 - O

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>

passed in I.A.No.1073 of 2009 in O.P.No.14 of 2009, if the

petitioner has applied for, within a period of ten days from the

date of receipt/production of a copy of this judgment. There will

be a direction to the respondent bank not to proceed against the

properties of the petitioner in respect of the loan transaction for a

period of two weeks from the date of this judgment.
