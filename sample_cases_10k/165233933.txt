    civil suit on 26.10.1970 before Senior Sub Judge, Bilaspur




    for declaration that Smt. Janki was limited owner of the

    suit land which was in possession of plaintiffs NO.1 and 2,


    defendants No.1 to 3 and Chaman Lal and a permanent

     14(1)</a> are of the widest possible amplitude and include the

     state of owning a property even though the owner is not in

     actual or physical possession of the same: Thus, where a
     widow gets a share in the property under a preliminary
     decree before or at the time when the 1956 Act had been
     passed but had not been given actual possession under a



     final decree, the property would be deemed to be
     possessed by her and by force of<a href="/doc/1871141/" id="a_25"> s. 14(1)</a> she would get
     absolute interest. in the property. It is equally well settled




     that the possession of the widow, however, must be under
     some vestige of a claim, right or title, because the section





     does not contemplate the possession of any rank trespasser
     with- out any right or title.

     question of law is res judicata in a subsequent

     "where the decision of the Court in a previous

     between the same parties with regard to the

        proceeding.
</p>




<p id="p_83">        This rule admits of certain exceptions. One is
        that where the decision relates to the
        jurisdiction of the Court to try the earlier
        proceeding, it will not operate as res
        judicata, if in the subsequent case it is found





        to be erroneous because the question of
        jurisdiction of the Court is unrelated to the
        rights claimed by one party and denied by
        the other. Another exception is where the

        law is altered since the earlier decision, the

        earlier decision will not operate as res
        judicata between the same parties. Here, it
        is nobody's case that there has been a
        subsequent legislation by which the law has
        been altered. Shri Verma's contention in this



        regard is that since every decision of the
        Supreme Court is "law" by virtue of <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_36">Article
        141</a> of the Constitution, it should be said




        that when the Supreme Court decided AIR
        1968 SC 1218, it tantamounted to alteration





        in the law, since the earlier decision which
        was rendered by this Court in L. P. A. (1960
        MPLJ 195) = (AIR 1960 Madh Pra 152). This





        argument is not well-founded. <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_37">Article 141</a> of
        the Constitution enacts that the law
        declared by the Supreme Court "shall be
        binding on all Courts" within the territory of
        India. This means that when the Supreme
        Court expresses its view on any particular
        point of law, such expression of view shall
        be considered as overriding a contrary view
        expressed on the point in an earlier decision
