<p id="p_1">7   09-08-2016                   The manner in which the Police Officials have

                  conducted themselves in making available copy of the case

                  diary of Bahadurpur Police Station Case No. 139 of 2015 is

                  disturbing. Either they have taken the proceedings of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.6476 of 2016 (7) dt.09-08-2016</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           2/3</span>




              Court too casually or they have acted deliberately in the

              matter.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                              By an order, dated 12.02.2016, carbon copy of

              the case diary was called for. On 17.03.2016, this Court

              noticed that the copy of the case diary, made available to

              the Court, was not complete and accordingly, again, called

              for up-to-date case diary. On 01.08.2016, when the matter

              was taken up, the Court noticed a communication made by

              the     Sub-Divisional          Police      Officer,   Patna   City,   dated

              11.05.2016, at Flag-G, to the effect that the said case diary

              had already been sent to the Court on 29.02.2016. This

              compelled this Court to require the Sub-Divisional Police

              Officer, Patna City, to file an affidavit to the effect that the

              copy of the case diary, which was made available to the

              Court was complete copy of the case diary.

</p><p id="p_3">                              Pursuant to the said order, the Sub-Divisional

              Police Officer, Patna City, has filed a counter affidavit,

              stating, inter alia, that after the case diary was sent on

              29.02.2016, certain developments took place in investigation

              of Bahadurpur Police Station Case No. 139 of 2015. When he

              was asked by the order, dated 17.03.2016, certainly the

              investigation had progressed from the date up to which the

              case diary was made available to this Court. In stead of

              making available the complete case diary, in the light of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">         Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.6476 of 2016 (7) dt.09-08-2016</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                   3/3</span>




                      order of this Court, dated 17.03.2016, the Sub-Divisional

                      Police Officer, Patna City, informed this Court that the case

                      diary had already been sent. From the case diary, which has,

                      now, been made available to this Court, it appears that up to

                      17.03.2016, the investigation had progressed, as contained

                      in paragraph nos. 226 to 252 of the case diary.

</p><p id="p_4">                                      The Sub-Divisional Police Officer, Patna City,

                      appears to have misled this Court by making communication

                      to this Court, through his letter, dated 11.05.2016, which

                      amounts to gross contempt of this Court.

</p><p id="p_5">                                      Let the Sub-Divisional Police Officer, Patna City,

                      file a show cause as to why proceedings for contempt of

                      Court be not initiated against him and he be not punished

                      duly.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                                      Such show cause reply must be filed within a

                      period of one week from today.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                                      Place this matter, under the same heading, on

                      18th August, 2016.
