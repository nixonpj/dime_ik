<p id="p_1">               Ld. counsel for the plaintiff has stated that they have 

received the rent as per the agreed terms  i.e. @ Rs. 35,000/­ per 

month   w.e.f.   1.9.2010   till   31.08.2013.     The   rent   had   to   be 

increased to Rs. 39,000/­ w.e.f. 1.9.2013, but the defendant has 


Suit No. 59/14        Ravinder Bir Sing V. Sushil Kr Raut         Page ....1 of 4
 defaulted   in   the   paying   the   same.     No   rent   has   been   paid   for 

September   2013   onwards.     The   defendant   had   been   given 

opportunity   to   liquidate   their   liability,   failing   which   it   was 

directed that the provisions of Order 15A CPC would come into 

play.    
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.              The defendant has failed to file the Written Statement 

and is also not entitled to any defence having failed to liquidate 

the arrears of rent. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.              Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff has prayed for a decree 

under Order 12 Rule 6 CPC, as the facts required for adjudicating 

possession   do   not   require   to   be   proved.     The   defendant   was 

inducted  as a  tenant  in the suit  premises vide an un­registered 

lease which provided for a tenure of three years w.e.f. 01.09.2012. 

As   such   the   tenancy   was   a   monthly   one   which   has   been 

terminated   by   the   legal  notice  dated  13.12.13  calling  upon  the 

defendant   to   quit.     Apart   from  being  replied to, the  said legal 

notice   is   also   supported   by   the   postal   receipt.     In   a   suit   for 

possession, all that is required to adjudicate possession in favour 

of   the   plaintiff,   is   a   tenant­landlord   relationship   and   its   due 

termination, provided the rent is Rs. 3500/­ per month.

</p><p id="p_4"> 4.               In   view   of   the   facts   of   the   case,   the   plaintiff   is 

entitled to a decree for possession under Order 12 Rule 6 CPC at 

this stage itself.    A decree for possession is passed in favour of 

the plaintiff and against the defendant in respect of the premises

Delhi­110 014, as per the site plan annexed.

Suit No. 59/14        Ravinder Bir Sing V. Sushil Kr Raut         Page ....3 of 4
 Suit No. 59/14

Present :         Counsel for the plaintiff 

                  Shri Ashok Kumar Tobris, Ld. counsel for the defendant

                  Vide   separate   Judgment,   a   decree   for   possession   is 

passed in terms thereof.  Decree sheet be prepared.

</p><p id="p_7">                  Ld.   counsel   for   the   defendant   has   filed   an   application 

under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC praying for dismissal of the suit on the 

grounds that there is no cause of action in filing the present suit for 

possession.  Such averment made by the Ld. counsel for the defendant/ 

applicant is misplaced.   In cases of monthly tenancy, the same can be 

terminated by a notice to quit in terms of <a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_1">section 106</a> of Transfer of 

Property Act.   This application is frivolous and is dismissed outright 

with cost of Rs. 1000/­.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                  With respect to the arrears of rent and quantum of mesne 

profits and damages, the plaintiff may lead necessary evidence.     As 

the issue with respect to mesne profits is more by way of inquiry, both 

parties are at liberty to place reliance on the documents/evidence in 

support of the present market rental of the suit property.
