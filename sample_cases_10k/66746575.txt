          The    petitioner        has       challenged       the   official

respondents' decision considering its bid to be non-responsive.

</p><p id="p_5">2.        The bid capacity is calculated in accordance with

clause 4 of the NIT. There are three variables, namely,

                                   1 of 3


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                ::: Downloaded on - 02-04-2016 00:08:23 :::</span>
 CWP-27007-2015(O&amp;M)and other connected matters                     2




variables A, N and B. Each of these variables is defined.

Variable A reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  "A = Maximum value of Civil Engineering
                  works executed in any one year (year
                  means Financial year) during the last
                  five years (updated to the price level
                  of the Financial year in which bids are
                  received at a rate per year as
                  indicated in the BDS) taking into
                  account the completed as well as works
                  in progress."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">3.            The petitioner contends that the official respondents

took into consideration the payments received by them and not

the value of the civil engineering works. It further contends

that for the purpose of variable A, the value of the works

completed as well as works in progress are relevant and payment

in respect thereof is not relevant.

</p><p id="p_7">4.            Even assuming the petitioner's interpretation of

variable A to be correct, it would make no difference in the

facts and circumstances of the present case. The petitioner

contends that certain works were carried out during the

relevant period, but the "credit" for the same was given by the

party concerned only for the subsequent period. The petitioner

further contends that it is probably on account of such party

having actually carried out the measurements subsequently that

it made the entries later.
</p>
<p id="p_8">5.            Firstly, normally at least, measurement books reflect

the work done on a particular date. Even assuming that the

party concerned had accounted for or entered in its measurement

books an incorrect date, it was for the petitioner to have


                                          2 of 3

sought and obtained clarification in that regard and satisfied

the official respondents regarding the same. In any event, this

is a dispute which cannot be gone into in the present

petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.            The writ petitions are, therefore, dismissed.

</p><p id="p_10">7.            The interim orders stand vacated.
