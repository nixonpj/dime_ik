injuries in a motor vehicular accident which took place on 13.12.2014 at

about 10.30 P.M. in the area of opposite ISGEC Factory Yamuna Nagar, on

account of rash and negligent driving of tractor Trolley bearing registration

No. HR-02H-4156 by Suresh Pal respondent No. 1, petitioner claimant

Ranjeet Singh had brought a claim petition under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_3">Section 166</a> of the Motor

Vehicles Act, 1988 against respondents Suresh Pal-driver, Karam Singh-

owner (since deceased) now represented by his LRs and National Insurance

Company Limited, Yamuna Nagar-insurer of that tractor trolley, claiming

compensation of Rs.10 lacs.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             On being put to notice, all the three respondents appeared and

contested the claim petition. Issues on merits were framed and the parties

were afforded adequate opportunities to lead evidence.

Yamuna Nagar at Jagadhari vide Award dated 24.3.2017 accepted the claim

following details :-

Court by way of filing an appeal, notice of which was given to the

respondent-Insurance Company and it has put in appearance through

counsel.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            I have heard learned counsel for the parties besides going

through the record.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            The Tribunal on analysis of the evidence adduced before it had

granted a sum of Rs.77,500/- towards medical expenses. However,

considering the fact that some time the Chemists do not issue bills of the

medicines purchased and many a times such bills etc. get misplaced, such

amount is enhanced to Rs.90,000/-. The injured claimant had remained

hospitalized for about 12 years and thereafter got follow up treatment. He

has undergone surgery also. The Tribunal has awarded a meager amount of

Rs.3,000/- on account of conveyance charges to him which in my view

considered view required enhancement. Therefore, the same is enhanced to

Rs.15,000/-. The Tribunal has clubbed the two heads together that is of

special diet and special attendant charges granting a sum of Rs.5,000/-. In

my considered view, the claimant deserves to be granted compensation

under different Heads and at adequate level. Therefore, for special diet a

sum of Rs.15,000/- is awarded. Under the Head attendant another sum of

Rs.15,000/- is awarded. The amount of Rs.14,000/- awarded for loss of

earning due to hospitalization and inability to do work is also on the lower

side, therefore, the same is increased to Rs.20,000/-. The petitioner claimant

has suffered 10% permanent disability in the form of restriction in

movement of right knee. The Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.25,000/- to

him for that disability. However, the Apex Court in judgment <a href="/doc/32163735/" id="a_4">Master

Mallikarjun vs. Divisional Manager, The National Insurance Company

Limited and another</a> 2013(4) R.C.R. (Civil), 295 has issued guidelines for

award of compensation to a child who had suffered permanent disability in a

motor vehicular accident as follows :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            (i)     For permanent disability upto 10% Rs.One Lakh.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            (ii)    Disability above 10% and upto 30% Rs.3 lakhs.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">            (iii)   Disability upto 60% Rs.4 lakhs.
</blockquote>
<pre id="pre_3">            (iv)     Disability upto 90% Rs.5 lakhs.

            (v)     Disability above 90% Rs. 6 lakhs.

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_4">            In view of that the permanent disability upto 10% Rs.1 lac is to

be awarded. Though it is stated that this judgment is with regard to a child

who had suffered permanent disability to his entire body but even then the

amount awarded is inadequate. The same is enhanced to Rs.50,000/-. The

Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.27,500/- for pain and suffering. The same

is enhanced to Rs.30,000/- and on account of loss of amenities of life a sum

of Rs.10,000/- is awarded. The very fact that due to suffering injuries in the

accident the petitioner claimant would not be able to walk, run and move

around and lead life of a normal human being as he used to do earlier, this

amount is inadequate and is enhanced to Rs.20,000/-. For loss of

expectation of life another sum of Rs.10,000/- is awarded to the claimant.

</blockquote><p id="p_8">The Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.10,000/- to the claimant towards

future medical expenses which I find to be adequate. Therefore, the total

compensation amount comes out to Rs.2,75,000/-. The Tribunal has

 F.A.O. No. 5730 of 2017 and

awarded compensation of Rs.1,72,000/-. In that way, the additional amount

of compensation comes out to Rs.1,03,000/-(2,75,000 - 1,72,000), which is

awarded to the claimant. The liability to pay such compensation shall be

joint and several for all the three respondents. The claimant shall be entitled

to get interest on the additional amount of compensation at the rate of 7.5%

per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till actual realization.

</p><p id="p_9">             With such modification, appeal bearing F.A.O. No. 5730 of 2017

is allowed partly.
</p>
<p id="p_10">             With regard to appeal bearing F.A.O. No. 5731 of 2017 which is

filed on account of suffering damage to the Car bearing registration No. HR-

02W-6175 in which injured Ranjeet Singh was travelling at the relevant time,

the Tribunal has dealt with this aspect in para No. 22 of the Award, granting

compensation of Rs.55,000/-. I find that compensation awarded is fair and

adequate and no scope is there for its enhancement. Therefore, appeal bearing

F.A.O. No. 5731 of 2017 stands dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_4">
