against   the   defendant   stating   that   the   defendant   had   approached   the
plaintiff bank for grant of loan of Rs  3,83,283/­  for purchase of vehicle
above   mentioned   vehicle.   On   the   request   of   defendant,   plaintiff
sanctioned the loan amount and disbursed an amount of Rs.  3,76,800/­
on  27.01.2015  after   deducting   an   amount   of   Rs.  6,483/­  towards
processing   fee,   stamp   duty   and   motor   secure,   in   terms   of   the   loan
documents,   executed   by   the   defendant.   The   defendant   had   agreed   to

8,240/­   each.   The   defendants   have   executed   credit   facility   application,

charges besides future installments. Irreparable loss shall be caused to
the   plaintiff   unless   a   receiver   is   appointed   to   take   the   charge   of   the
vehicle in question. It is prayed that Mr. Ashish Mathur, Representative
of   plaintiff   be   appointed   as   receiver   to   take   possession   of   the   afore
