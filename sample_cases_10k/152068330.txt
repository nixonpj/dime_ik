Md. Sayeed Vs. Shamsuddin                            Page No.1 of 8
 JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Brief Facts: The present petition has been filed under
<a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_2">Section 14(1)(a)</a> of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 (in short, 'the
Act') by three petitioners, namely, (1) Mohd. Sayeed (2) Mohd.
Hanif (3) Modh. Sharif against the respondent Shamshuddin.
During the course of the trial, the petitioner no. 1 expired and
accordingly his legal heirs were brought on record. However for
the sake of convenience, the original petitioners are referred
hereinafter as the 'petitioners' and the new petitioners are referred
as 'substituted petitioners'. It is the case of the petitioners that the
respondent was inducted as a tenant in respect of one room along
with Verandha at first floor of the property no. 67-B/2, plot no. 106,
Khureji Khas, Delhi and lastly the rent of the premises was Rs.
330/- pm excluding other charges. The said rent was enhanced
vide legal notice dated 29.02.2008 by 10% and the rent stood
increased @ Rs. 363/- w.e.f. 01.04.08. The aforesaid property has
been shown in red colour in the site plan attached with the petition
and referred to hereinafter as the 'premises in question'.         It is
alleged that the respondent has not paid rent w.e.f. 01.07.2002 till
date and the demand notice dated 29.02.2008 was also sent in this
regard but the respondent sent a false reply dated 28.03.2008.
</p>

<p id="p_2">Written Statement
</p><p id="p_3">2.           In the WS, no dispute has been raised as regards the
relationship between the parties as landlord and tenant and on the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Md. Sayeed Vs. Shamsuddin                                Page No.2 of 8</span>
 point of service of legal notice but the respondent specifically
raised disputes regarding on the point of portions of the tenanted
premises, on the point of rate of rent and existence of arrears of
rent.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3.           In the replication, the allegations of the respondent are
controverted and the averments made in the petition are reiterated.
</p>

<p id="p_5">4.           In order to prove their case, the petitioners examined
Mohd. Sharif (one of the petitioners) as PW1 and one Sh. Hazi
Mohd. Yamin, Advocate as PW2. Petitioner also relied on various
documents which are Ex. PW1/1 to Ex. PW1/5. PW2 also proved
document Ex. PW2/A to Ex. PW2/C. Likewise, the respondent also
examined himself as RW1. He also relied on various documents
which are Ex. RW1/1 to Ex. RW1/6.
</p>

<p id="p_6">5.           I have heard learned counsel for the parties and
perused the record.
</p>

<p id="p_7">REASON FOR DECISION


</p><p id="p_8">6.           In the present case, following points emerged which
require determination of this court:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             (1)    Identification of the property in question
             (2)    Rate of rent
             (3)    Existence of arrears of rent



E. No.- 187/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Md. Sayeed Vs. Shamsuddin                               Page No.3 of 8</span>
 (1)   Identification of the property in question
</blockquote><p id="p_9">7.          In the instant petition, the petitioner specifically
referred one room with verandha as tenanted premises situated at
first floor as shown in red colour in the site plan attached with the
petition whereas the respondent claimed himself to be a tenant in
the portions situated at ground floor as well as first floor by
describing the portions of the ground floor as one room, kitchen,
latrine bath room and one shop and of the first floor - one room,
verandha, kitchen along with roof rights.
</p>

<p id="p_10">8.          At the outset, counsel for petitioner specifically argued
that before filing of the present case, the respondent along with 12
other tenants had filed a suit for permanent injunction against the
petitioners and in the said suit, a site plan was attached in which
the portion of the respondent has been clearly shown to be on the
first floor only which corresponds to the premises in question. It is
specifically stated that the portion claimed by the respondent in
respect of the ground floor are already in possession of other
tenants against whom the petitioner had already filed eviction
petition. The counsel for petitioner further specifically argued that
the respondent although denied his signatures on the said suit but
his signatures have been identified by the Advocate who had filed
the said case.     Keeping in view the evidence of the said
Advocate/PW2, I hold that the petitioners proved on record filing of



E. No.- 187/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Md. Sayeed Vs. Shamsuddin                              Page No.4 of 8</span>
 the previous suit against the petitioners herein by the respondent
along with other tenants. The site plan of the said suit clearly
shows that the portion of the respondent (plaintiff no. 6 therein) is
in respect of one tin shed room and verandha situated at the first
floor of the property in question. The respondent has also not
placed on record any site plan or any other document to show that
he was or is in possession of any other portion except the
premises in question. In the light of above said evidence brought
on record, I hold that the respondent is a tenant in respect of the
portions as shown in red colour in the site plan Ex. PW1/1 only.
</p>

<p id="p_11">(2)    Rate of rent
</p><p id="p_12">9.          The petitioner claimed rate of rent of the premises in
question as Rs. 330/- pm and enhanced rent of Rs. 363/- w.e.f.
01.04.08 after service of legal notice dated 29.02.2008. On the
other hand, the respondent claimed that the rent of the premises
was lastly Rs. 200/- pm. None of the parties has produced on
record any documentary evidence towards agreed rate of rent.
However, the respondent placed great reliance on four rent
receipts which are Ex. RW1/1 to Ex. RW1/4 which show rate of
rent as Rs. 200/- pm for the subsequent period. Said rent receipts
are   strongly   disputed   on   the   ground    that   same    were
prepared/manipulated after receiving of the legal notice. In my
detailed findings in the subsequent paragraphs, it is held that the
above said four rent receipts are forged documents. Accordingly



E. No.- 187/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Md. Sayeed Vs. Shamsuddin                               Page No.5 of 8</span>
 the stand of the respondent towards rate of rent as claimed by him
is not proved on record. Accordingly I hold that the rent of the
premises was Rs. 330/- pm and it was increased to Rs. 363/- (with
increase of 10%) w.e.f. 01.04.08.
</p>

<p id="p_13">(3)   Arrears of rent
</p><p id="p_14">10.          The petitioner has claimed the arrears of rent w.e.f.
01.07.2002 @ Rs. 330/- pm and at the enhanced rent of Rs. 363/-
pm w.e.f. 01.04.08.      It is stand of the respondent that the
respondent used to pay rent from time to time and in this regard
rent receipts were also issued by Mohd. Sayeed (petitioner no. 1).
The petitioner placed on record four such rent receipts purportedly
issued on 01.04.85, 01.12.99, 01.08.05 and 01.02.08. The said
receipts are proved as Ex. RW1/1 to Ex. RW1/4. The counsel for
petitioner specifically raised serious doubt about the said rent
receipts and it is specifically stated that the said rent receipts bear
signatures of the collector of rent in the name of Mohd. Sayeed
whereas Mohd. Sayeed was a blind man and he had never signed
nor knew as to how write. From the said rent receipts, it is clear
that the same are in Urdu language. Their translated copies have
been placed on record.            During cross examination, the
respondent/RW1 categorically admitted that Mohd. Sayeed was a
blind man and that he does not know as to what has been written
in the said rent receipts. Respondent further admitted that he had
not filed any rent receipts for the period between 1985-1999,



E. No.- 187/08
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Md. Sayeed Vs. Shamsuddin                                Page No.6 of 8</span>
 1999-2005, 2005-2008. From the above said admissions of the
respondent and the fact that he neither proved the signatures of
the collector of rent of the aforesaid rent receipts by any means nor
examined any witness to prove that Mohd. Sayeed used to sign or
had been seen writing/signing by anyone, I am of the considered
opinion that the respondent did not prove the factum of issuance of
said rent receipts by Mohd. Sayeed. This court also observes that
out of the four rents receipts, the three rent receipts which are Ex.
RW1/2 to Ex. RW1/4 are apparently in the same printing format,
coloure and design and from their similar characteristics, it is highly
improbable that the same style of format of rent receipts prevailed
for a long period starting from 1999 to 2008 (for which years they
are shown). The aforesaid fact strengthened the finding of this
court that the aforesaid four rent receipts were prepared
subsequently by forging the same just to create false evidence.
Accordingly I hold that respondent failed to prove on record the
payment of rent to the petitioner through the aforesaid receipts.
</p>

<p id="p_15">Conclusion


</p><p id="p_16">11.          In the light of above said evidence, I hold that the
petitioner succeeded in proving the existence of arrears of rent
w.e.f. 01.07.02 @ Rs. 330/- pm till 31.03.2008 and for the
subsequent period after issuance of the legal notice @ Rs. 363/-
pm w.e.f. 01.04.08 till date. The petition is allowed accordingly.

The said order is modified now and the respondent is directed to

period of three years preceding to the filing of the present case) till
31.03.2008 and thereafter @ Rs. 363/- pm w.e.f. 01.04.08 till date
