                           UDAY PRATAP SINGH son of late Dharmu Singh,

</pre>
<p id="p_1">9   01.04.2010                Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, the

                    State and the informant.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                              The petitioner is in custody and seeks bail in a

                    case registered under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_1">sections 304(B)</a> and <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_2">201</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">34</a> of the

                    Indian Penal Code.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                              A supplementary affidavit has been filed on

                    behalf of the petitioner stating therein that the statement of

                    the victim lady was recorded by the Additional City

                    Magistrate II at Varanasi in Heritage Hospital, who is

                    Executive Magistrate in the State of Uttar Pradesh.

</p><p id="p_4">                               In the first information report, the allegation has

                    been set up to the effect that the petitioner along with his

                    family members had killed his wife and it is also alleged

                    that there was demand of LCD TV, etc. and the victim

                    lady was being tortured earlier also for such demand.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                   2</span>




          It had been submitted on behalf of the petitioner

that the death is accidental, as the victim lady's dress

caught fire while she was trying to burn a candle and on

the same day she was rushed to the hospital and the doctor

informed the police and the statement of the victim was

recorded by the police at Bose Clinic, Dehri-on-Sone. The

same has been brought on record as annexure 3.

Thereafter, due to the reason that the burn injury was very

serious, the victim lady was taken to Varanasi and

admitted in Heritage Hospital, where she was treated for

about 19 days and on 30th July, 2009 she succumbed to the

burn injuries. In support of his submission, the petitioner

has appended the death certificate issued by the concerned

Hospital. It had further been contended that after the death

of the victim lady the police had prepared "Panchanama",

which contains the signatures of altogether five persons

including one Anil Kumar Singh, brother-in-law of the

informant, as well as Sourabh Kumar, the cousin brother

of the deceased. Learned counsel for the petitioner drew

attention of this Court towards the statement of one of the

witnesses of the inquest report, namely, Surendra Pratap

Singh, recorded by the police, who had stated that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                    3</span>




victim was being treated at the Hospital and succumbed to

the burn injuries and family members of the informant

were present at the time of treatment. It is also stated that

the brother-in-law of the informant as well as the cousin

brother of the victim had also signed the said

"Panchanama". That apart, it is submitted that the

statement of the informant, his brother and nephew,

Sourabh Kumar (whose signatures are on inquest report)

etc. had been recorded by the police during the course of

investigation under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_4">section 161</a> of the Code of Criminal

Procedure. They had accepted that they were present

during the course of treatment of the victim lady and also

that the receipt with regard to purchase of medicines

contains signature of the brother of the deceased, namely,

Pankaj Singh. Above all, it has been urged that the

statement of the victim lady was also recorded in presence

of    the City Magistrate, which stands recorded in

paragraph no. 21 of the supplementary case diary, wherein

the victim lady had categorically stated that she had

received injuries due to the accidental fire and nobody had

tried to burn her. It stands noted below such written

statement, since both the hands of the injured patients
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                   4</span>




were bandaged, therefore, impression of the right toe had

been taken. The statement was recorded by the ACM,

Varanasi has been recorded by the police and Dr. R.K.

Pandey had also signed the same. Learned counsel submits

that in view of the fact that the victim lady died

subsequently and the statement made by herself before

death is treated to be as dying declaration, the entire

allegation falls flat. The petitioner is stated to be in

custody since 05.08.2009. It is further contended that one

of the co-accused, namely, Megh Nath Singh, the brother-

in-law of the deceased, had been granted bail by a Bench

of this Court vide order dated 21.11.2009 in Cr. Misc. No.

41438 of 2009 and one sister-in-law had been granted

anticipatory bail by a Bench of this Court in Cr. Misc. No.

139 of 2009 vide order dated 08.03.2010.
</p>
<p id="p_5">          Learned counsel for the State submitted that it is

a case under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_5">section 304B</a> of the Indian Penal Code and

the petitioner is the husband of the victim lady. However,

he could not deny the fact that the victim lady's statement

had been recorded by the executive magistrate, which is

apparent from paragraph no. 21 of the case diary.

</p><p id="p_6">          Learned counsel for the informant submitted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                    5</span>




that since it is apparent that there was 85 % burn, thus, the

circumstance under which such statement of the victim

was recorded becomes doubtful. However, it is also stated

that the police has wrongly stated that during the course of

investigation some of the witnesses as also in paragraph 47

of the case diary had given such statement but he failed to

show that any protest thereof has been made on behalf of

the informant.
</p>
<p id="p_7">          Having regard to the facts and circumstances of

the case in view of facts emanating from the materials

collected during the course of the investigation, this Court

would be inclined to grant bail to the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_8">          As a result, the petitioner, Uday Pratap Singh, is

directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of

Rs. 10,000/-(ten thousand) with two sureties of the like

amount each to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial

Magistrate, Rohtas at Sasaram in Rohtas Police Station

Case No. 82/09. However, it is directed that the petitioner

shall remain present on each and every date in course of

trial before the court concerned. If the petitioner fails to

appear on two consecutive dates in course of trial without

any reasonable cause shown by him, the court concerned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                         6</span>




     would be at liberty to take steps for cancellation of his bail

     bonds.
</p>
<p id="p_9">               It is further made clear that the trial court

     concerned shall proceed with the trial and decide the same

     on its own merit in accordance with law without being

     prejudiced with any finding or observation made in this

     order.
