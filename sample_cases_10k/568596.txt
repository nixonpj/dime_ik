AND
THE HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE M.E.N.PATRUDU


H.C.P.(MD) No.145 of 2006


Jayalakshmi			... 		Petitioner


vs


1.The District Magistrate and
   the District Collector
   Virudhunagar District
   Virudhunagar
2.The Secretary to the Government
     	of Tamilnadu
   Prohibition and Excise Department
   Secretariat, Chennai 600 009.

   Virudhunagar East Police Station
   Virudhunagar			... 		Respondents


	Habeas corpus petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India praying to issue a writ of habeas corpus directing the respondents to
produce the body of the detenu namely 'Mandhiramoorthy @ Moorthy' before this
Court who is now detained in the Central Prison, Madurai, pursuant to the
detention order passed by the first respondent in Cr.M.P.No.03/2006 dated
6.2.2006 and to call for the records and quash the same and release the detenu
at liberty forthwith.


!For Petitioner		...	Mr.N.Mohideen Basha


^For Respondents	...	Mr.N.Senthurpandian, A.P.P.


:ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">(Order of this Court was made by M.CHOCKALINGAM, J.)


	Challenging an order of detention made by the first respondent in
Cr.M.P.No.03/2006 dated 6.2.2006, the petitioner, who is the wife of the detenu,
has brought forth this petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
</p><p id="p_2">	2.The sponsoring authority made a recommendation alleging that there was
one ground case and apart from that, five other adverse cases were also noticed
against the detenu; that it would be suffice to term him as Goonda, and the
detention order was required under the circumstances. The first respondent on
such report by the sponsoring authority, perused the materials and termed the
petitioner's husband as Goonda, since, in the opinion of the detaining
authority, his activities were prejudicial to the maintenance of the public
order, and hence, an order was passed accordingly. It is being challenged by the
petitioner before this Court.
</p><p id="p_3">	3.According to the learned Counsel for the petitioner, the detenu never
moved for any bail application, and thus, there was no imminent possibility of
the detenu coming out on bail, and such a situation was thoroughly ruled out,
and so far as the remand report was concerned, a remand requisition was made;
but, no order of remand was passed by the Judicial Magistrate, and when a copy
was also asked for, that was also not furnished to him, and apart from that,
much delay is also noticed.  Added further, the learned Counsel that all the
cases mentioned by the detaining authority, are under Sec.506(ii) of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">I.P.C</a>.,
which would go to show that they were against the individual acts; that there is
nothing to show that they would be prejudicial to the maintenance of the public
order, and thus, it would be clear that the first respondent has acted
mechanically and without any application of mind, terming him as Goonda, and
hence, it has got to be set aside.
</p><p id="p_4">	4.The Court heard the learned Additional Public Prosecutor on the above
contentions.
</p><p id="p_5">	5.After careful consideration of the rival submissions made and scrutiny
of the materials available, this Court is of the opinion that the order of
detention has got to be set aside on the short ground that all the cases
registered against him, are pending before the Judicial Magistrate, and in the
face of it, it cannot be stated that his activities are prejudicial to the
maintenance of the public order.  But, in the instant case, all these cases are
registered for the following offences:
</p><p id="p_6">Ground Case:
</p><p id="p_7">Virudhunagar East PS - Crime No.25/2006 - <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_3">Sections 324</a>, <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_4">307</a>, <a href="/doc/1688284/" id="a_5">387</a>, <a href="/doc/222396/" id="a_6">427</a> and
<a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_7">506(ii)</a> of I.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_8">Adverse Cases:
</p><p id="p_9">(1) Virudhunagar West PS - Crime No.284/2002 - <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_8">Sections 341</a>, <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_9">324</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_10">506(ii)</a> of
I.P.C.
</p><p id="p_10">(2) Virudhunagar Rural PS - Crime No.167/2002 - <a href="/doc/1198799/" id="a_11">Sections 294(b)</a>, <a href="/doc/222396/" id="a_12">427</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_13">506(ii)</a>
of I.P.C.
</p><p id="p_11">(3) Virudhunagar East PS - Crime No.55/2003 - Sec.394 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14">IPC</a> and Sec.3(1)(x) of the
SC/<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_15">ST Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1230184/" id="a_16">Sections 456</a>, <a href="/doc/764237/" id="a_17">394</a>, <a href="/doc/222396/" id="a_18">427</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_19">506(ii)</a> of IPC read with Sec.3(1)(x) of
the )Prevention of the Atrocities Act 1989 and <a href="/doc/1133601/" id="a_20">Sections 325</a> and <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_21">324</a> of IPC.
(4) Virudhunagar West PS - Crime No.274/2004 - <a href="/doc/1198799/" id="a_22">Sections 294(b)</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_23">323</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_24">506(i)</a>
of IPC.
</p><p id="p_12">(5) Virudhunagar East PS - rime No.21/2006 - Sec.75 of the Tamilnadu City Police
Act.
</p><p id="p_13">	6.The facts in those cases, which were placed before the authority, in the
opinion of the Court, would not be suffice to term him as Goonda, since on the
basis of the allegations made against him, it cannot be taken that he acted in a
manner prejudicial to the maintenance of the public order.  The Court has to
make a distinction between the activities which are prejudicial to the
maintenance of the public order, and the activities which are prejudicial to the
maintenance of the law and order.  In the instant case, there may be activities
which are prejudicial to the maintenance of the law and order; but, this Court
is unable to term it as one prejudicial to the maintenance of the public order.
In a case where the detaining authority is not satisfied that the activities
noticed, are prejudicial to the maintenance of the public order, no question of
detention order can be passed.  In the instant case, such ingredient is not
noticed, which, in the opinion of the Court, would be suffice to set aside the
impugned order.
</p><p id="p_14">	7.In the result, this habeas corpus petition is allowed setting aside the
order of the first respondent.  The detenu is directed to be set at liberty
forthwith unless his presence is required in any other case.
