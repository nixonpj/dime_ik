<p id="p_1">3   08-08-2019                  Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned APP
                   for the State.
</p><p id="p_2">                                2. The petitioner apprehends his arrest for the offences alleged
                   under Section 30(a) and 37(b) of the Bihar Prohibition and <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_1">Excise Act</a>, 2016
                   (hereinafter referred to as 'the <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_2">Prohibition Act</a>, 2016') registered in
                   connection with CIS No.270/2019 Obra P.S. Case No. 49 of 2019.
</p><p id="p_3">                                3. At the very outset, this Court takes note of an order
                   passed by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Ashok Sahani Vs. The
                   State of Bihar, 2017(3) PLJR 632. After a detailed deliberation over the
                   effect of <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_3">Section 76(2)</a> of the Prohibition Act, 2016, it was categorically
                   opined in paragraph-14 that the privilege of pre-arrest bail under
                   <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Section 438</a> of the Cr. P.C. is not available to person accused of having
                   committed an offence under the <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_5">Prohibition Act</a>, 2016. Certain
                   guidelines (not exhaustive) were also laid out in paragraph-30,
                   indicating circumstances where bail should normally be granted to the
                   accused persons on their production by the police or on their
                   surrender. The Registrar General was also directed to ensure that
                   stamp reporters would not place applications filed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_6">Section 438</a>
                   of the Cr. P.C. arising out of the cases under the <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_7">Prohibition Act</a>, 2016
                   before the Bench as defect free cases henceforth.
</p><p id="p_4">                                4. The aforesaid order in Ashok Sahani's case (supra) came
 Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.31590 of 2019(3) dt.08-08-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            2/4</span>




          to be considered of another co-ordinate Bench of this Court passed in
          Cr. Misc. No. 21578 of 2017 (Manish Kumar @ Lokesh Kumar Vs. The
          State of Bihar) which, by order dated 10.08.2017, held the earlier
          judgment per incuriam, apart from holding the provisions of <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_8">Section
          76(2)</a> of the Prohibition Act, 2016 as void in view of <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_9">Article 254</a> of the
          Constitution of India. The question whether the Registry could be
          restrained from entertaining anticipatory bail petitions as directed in
          Ashok Sahani's case (supra), was referred to a larger Bench.
</p><p id="p_5">                       5. By another judgment dated 03.10.2017 passed by a third
          co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Cr. Misc. No. 42985 of 2017 (Barun
          Kumar Vs. The State of Bihar), the issue relating to maintainability of
          anticipatory bail petitions in respect of offences under the <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_10">Prohibition
          Act</a>, 2016 came to be considered yet again. The decision in Manish
          Kumar's case (supra) was found to have been passed in oversight of
          the relevant provisions of the Constitution of India as well as <a href="/doc/1235626/" id="a_11">Section 4</a>
          of the Cr. P.C. which could not be placed before it. As such the decision
          in Ashok Sahani's case (supra) was held to be binding on a co-ordinate
          Bench wherein it had been held that an anticipatory bail petition
          under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_12">Section 438</a> of the Cr. P.C. cannot be maintained in cases of
          offences arising out of the <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_13">Prohibition Act</a>, 2016.
</p><p id="p_6">                       6. The reference to the Larger Bench in Cr. Misc. No. 21578
          of 2017 (Manish Kumar @ Lokesh Kumar Vs. The State of Bihar) was
          answered by the Division Bench in its order dated 06.11.2017, opining
          that the Registry could not be restrained from entertaining
          anticipatory bail petition in compliance of the order passed in Ashok
          Sahani's case (supra). However, in paragraph-9 of the said order, it was
          specifically stated that the aspect of the vires/validity/repugnancy of
          <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_14">Section 76(2)</a> was not being considered as the same was already sub-
          judice before the Apex Court. The principles noticed by an earlier
          Division Bench in <a href="/doc/191174405/" id="a_15">Bisheshwar Mishra vs. The State of Bihar</a>, 2016 (4)
          PLJR 1058 in the context of a similar bar to grant of anticipatory bail
          under the provisions of SC/<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_16">ST Act</a> in the light of the Apex Court's
          decision in Vilas Pandurang Pawar Vs. State of Maharashtra, (2012) 8
          SCC 795 were taken note of in paragraph-13, which cast a duty upon
 Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.31590 of 2019(3) dt.08-08-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            3/4</span>




          the Court considering the pre-arrest bail of an accused, to look into the
          allegations made in the F.I.R./Complaint to find out whether
          ingredients of the offence under the SC/<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_17">ST Act</a> were prima facie made
          out or not before exercising its judicial discretion under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_18">Section 438</a> of
          the Cr. P.C. It was therefore held that the law regarding consideration of
          an application under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_19">Section 438</a> of the Cr. P.C. for grant of pre-arrest
          bail to the accused under an Act where there is a bar to grant of
          anticipatory bail, had been settled as such.
</p><p id="p_7">                  7. It is relevant to take note that an order dated 14.02.2019 was
          passed by this Bench in Cr. Misc. No. 8719 of 2019 (<a href="/doc/194048211/" id="a_20">Nishikant Tiwary
          and Anr. vs. the State of Bihar</a>) rejecting the prayer for anticipatory bail
          as not maintainable in view of <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_21">Section 76(2)</a> of the Prohibition Act,
          2016. The said order was assailed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court
          giving rise to Special Leave to Appeal (Criminal) No. 2324 of 2019
          which, in a recent development, came to be disposed of on 11.03.2019,

                              dismissed.

                              and upon such surrender, if they file an
                              application for bail, the said Court after
                              hearing the parties on the application for
                              bail, consider the same and pass appropriate

          show that any material change on the question of maintainability has
