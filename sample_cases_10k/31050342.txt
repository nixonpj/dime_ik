<p id="p_1">1. The   plaintiff   had   filed   the   aforesaid   suit   for   permanent   and 

     mandatory   injunction   claiming   himself   to   be   an   owner   of   the 

     property   bearing   Municipal   No.   3499   ½   to   3503   (New)   [in   plaint 

     typed   as   3502   (new)]   Ward   No.   VI,   Chawri   Bazar,   Delhi­110006 

     having purchasd the same from the Custodian of Evacuee Property, 

     New   Delhi   vide   Certificate   of   Sale   dated   30.10.1975,   which   was 

     bounded as under:

                   South:      property No. VI/3498 (New)


Suit No. 143/09                                                        Page No. 2/12
</pre><p id="p_2"> 2. The aforesaid property was stated to be constructed up to ground 

  floor and first floor on the front side and on the back side thereof, 

  no construction was stated to be existing and was having roofs on 

  the ground ground floor.  It has been averred further that when the 

  plaintiff had visited the said property in the beginning of November, 

  1990 and went to the first floor, he saw that on the back side of the 

  aforesaid property, the first and second floor had also been illegally 

  and unauthorizedly constructed by the defendants no. 1 and 2 after 

  encroaching upon the roofs of the ground floor without having any 

  right, title or interest  to do so.    Not only  this,  but  also,  the said 

  defendants   after   having   made   the   encroachments   and   having 

  constructed   the   property   in   an   illegal   and   unauthorized   manner 

  had also let out the same to the defendants no. 5 to 8 herein and 

  some of the portion was lying vacant and locked by the defendant 

  no.1.     The   defendant   no.   1   was   also   stated   to   be   issuing   rent 

  receipts   to   the   other   defendants,   who   were   inducted   by   him   as 

  tenants. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">3. Upon question being raised by the plaintiff on the defendants no. 1 

  and 2 relating to their encroachment upon and carrying out illegal 

  and unauthorized construction on the first and second floor on the 

  roofs   of   ground   floor   and   induction   of   tenants   in   the   form   of 

  defendants no. 5 to 8 in the rooms shown as A, B, C, D in the site 

  plan   without   having   any   right,   title   or   interest   therein,   the 

  defendants had paid no heed to the aforesaid query of the plaintiff 

  and had also threatened him to further part with the possession of 

  the suit property.  The complaints in this regard were also made by 

  the plaintiff to the MCD and other concerned authorities but all in 

  vain.
</p>

</p><p id="p_5">Suit No. 143/09                                                      Page No. 3/12
</p><p id="p_6"> 4. The cause of action for filing of the present suit was stated to have 

  firstly arisen in the beginning of November, 1990 when the plaintiff 

  had visited the aforesaid property and found existence of illegal and 

  unauthorized construction thereon.   It had further arisen on such 

  various   dates   and   occasions   when   the   plaintiff   had   asked   the 

  defendants to demolish the aforesaid illegal construction and had 

  also   approached   the   various   authorities   for   redressal   of   his 

  grievances and was stated to be continuing one in nature. 


</p><p id="p_7">5. Since the suit property was situated at Delhi and defendants were 

  also residing and working for gain at Delhi and the entire cause of 

  action   had   also   arisen   at   Delhi.   Hence,   this   Court   was   stated   to 

  have jurisdiction to try and entertain the present case.


</p><p id="p_8">6. In the light of aforesaid facts and circumstances, it was prayed that 

  by way of a decree of mandatory injunction passed in favour of the 

  plaintiff   and   against   the   defendant   no.   1,   2   and   5   to   9,   they   be 

  directed   to   demolish   the   unauthorized   and   illegal   construction 

  existing upon first and second floor on the back side portion of the 

  property bearing no. 3499 ½ to 3503 (New) [typed as property no. 

  3502   (new)   in   prayer   clause]   Ward   No.   VI,   Chawri   Bazar, 

  Delhi­110006 as was shown specifically in the site plan and further 

  by way of a decree of permanent injunction passed in favour of the 

  plaintiff   and   against   the   defendant   no.   1   and   2,   the   later   be 

  restrained   permanently   from   inducting   any   other   person   in   the 

  vacant   and  locked   portion  of   the  aforesaid   property   or   to  further 

  carry out any illegal or unauthorized construction therein and also 

  from parting with the possession of the portions marked A, B, C 

  and D as were shown in the site plan attached with the plaint.  

</p><p id="p_9">Suit No. 143/09                                                           Page No. 4/12
</p><p id="p_10"> 7. After service of the summons of the suit, only defendant no.1 had 

  appeared to contest the suit on its merits and other defendants had 

  chosen not to contest the same and the defendants no. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 

  7 &amp; 8 were proceeded ex­parte vide order dated 22.07.1999 by Ld. 

  Predecessor of this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">8. The defendant no. 1 had earlier filed his written statement which 

  later   on   was   also   amended   by   him,   wherein   he   had   taken   the 

  preliminary objections that the suit of the plaintiff was barred by 

  limitation and the plaintiff had no locus­standi to file and maintain 

  the   present   suit   which   had   been   filed   by   him   only   with   ulterior 

  motives just to harass the defendants as the property was owned 

  and   possessed   by   the   defendant   no.1   himself.     Further,   it   was 

  contended on his behalf that under the garb of the present suit, the 

  plaintiff was trying to seek declaration of his title.     In alternative, 

  the defendant no. 1 had also taken a plea of acquiring ownership of 

  property by means of adverse possession by reason of continued, 

  uninterrupted   and   unchecked   possession   of   the   premises   by   the 

  defendant as owner in his own right.  Plaintiff was also stated to be 

  guilty   of   concealment   of   true   and   material   facts   and   not 

  approaching the court with clean hands.  The suit was also stated 

  to be hit by doctrine of resjudicata as earlier a suit No. 167/92 filed 

  by the plaintiff for similar reliefs against this defendant as well as 

  others in respect of the same properties had already been dismissed 

  by the Court of Sh. Rajender Kumar, the then Ld. Civil Judge, Delhi 

  vide his judgment dated 23.02.2000 and as such the suit as filed 

  was not maintainable in its present form.

</p><p id="p_15"> 9. On the pleadings of the parties, vide orders dated 22.07.1999 Ld.

      unauthorizedly encroached upon and constructed first and 

      second floor on the suit property as shown in the site plan?

</p><p id="p_17">  2. Whether the defendants have unauthorizedly and illegally

  evidence   had   been   adduced   on   record   by   him   nor   even   certified 

  copy   of   the   judgment   in   the   aforesaid   suit   bearing   no.   167/92 

  decided on 23.02.2000 had been placed on record by him, on which 

  the Court could have taken a judicial notice thereof.  Hence, I have 

  no hesitation in holding that the defendant had failed to discharge 

  the onus of this issue, which is accordingly, answered in favour of 

  the plaintiff and against the defendant as the defendant had also 

  miserably  failed to prove as to against whom he was holding the 

  property   adversely   and   it   is   the   settled   proposition   of   law   that   a 

  person   can   become   owner   by   adverse   possession   only   when   the 

  property had been held adversely by him to the knowledge of the 

  true and lawful owner thereof and not otherwise.

</pre><p id="p_29"> 13.Since   all   these   issues   are   inter   related   having   bearing   on   each 

  other, hence they are taken up together for their disposal.  Onus to 

  prove these issues was upon the plaintiff and to discharge this onus 

  plaintiff had examined PW1 Sh. Gurcharan Kapur son of late Sh. 

  Gursharan Kapur, who had claimed himself to be a SPA of Sh.Jagat 

  Prakash   Kapur   son   of   deceased   plaintiff,   who   was   brought   on 

  record   lateron   vide   orders   dated   06.11.1997   after   death   of   the 

  plaintiff.     The   aforesaid   witness   had   filed   in   evidence,   his 

  examination­in­chief   by   way   of   affidavit   Ex.   PA   wherein   besides 

  reiterating the factual contents of the plaint on solemn affirmation 

  he had also placed on record the GPA executed in his favour as Ex. 

  PW1/A.    The certified  copy  of sale certificate has been  placed  on 

  record as Ex.PW1/1 and original death certificate of plaintiff is Ex. 

  PW1/2 on record.  Site plan of the property is Ex. PW1/3.  However, 

  it is to be noticed here that cross­examination of this witness was 

  deferred   at   the  request   of  Ld.   Defence   Counsel,   which  was  never 

  concluded   lateron   and   even   the   defendant   no.1   was   never 

  proceeded ex­parte in this case.  Hence, incomplete testimony of the 

  witness is inadmissible in evidence and thus cannot be relied upon. 

  However, even if it is presumed that the testimony of the witness 

  could have been admitted and read in evidence, then also I have no 

  hesitation in holding that in view of the law laid down by Hon'ble 

  Apex court in case titled as 'Janki Vasudev Bhojwani and Anr. vs. 

  Indus Ind Bank Ltd. reported in AIR 2005 SC 439', the Power of 

  Attorney Holder cannot replace his principal and can depose only 

  about   the   facts   of   which   he   had   acquired   knowledge   after   his 

  appointment   as   an   attorney   and   cannot   depose   on   behalf   of   the 

  principal by substituting him about the facts which were supposed 

Suit No. 143/09                                                       Page No. 8/12
   to be within exclusive knowledge and domain of the principal.  PW1 

  in this case has miserably failed to aver during his entire deposition 

  as  to   how   he   had   acquired   the  knowledge   about   the   facts  which 

  were exclusively  within the domain and knowledge of the plaintiff 

  himself.  Even the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court report in (2010) 

  10   SCC   512  in   case   of  Man   Kaur   (dead)   by   <a href="/doc/1897611/" id="a_1">LRs   vs.   Hartarar 

  Singh Sangha</a> rendered by Hon'ble Mr. Justice R.V. Ravindran, J., 

  wherein he had categorically held that the capacity of an attorney 

  do depose on behalf of his principal shall also be governed by the 

  status of the attorney and his relationship viz a viz his principal and 

  if his relationship stands in such proximity with the principal that it 

  could   be   easily   presumed   that   he   could   also   have   acquired   the 

  knowledge of some facts at the same point of time as was acquired 

  by his principal, then his deposition can be relied upon, also does 

  not come to the aid of present PW1 because he had also failed to 

  explain   the   proximity   of   his   status   and   relationship   with   the 

  plaintiff, which would have enabled him to acquire the knowledge of 

  those   facts   which   were   otherwise   confined   to   the   exclusive 

  knowledge of the plaintiff herein.  Hence, I am not inclined to accept 

  his deposition and same is held inadmissible in evidence.

</p><p id="p_33"> 15.PW3, wrongly numbered as PW2 is one Sh. Swadeshi Ram son of 

  Sh.   Dhanju   Ram,   Record   Clerk   from   House   Tax   Department   of 

  MCD, who had placed  on record  the copy  of inspection  book  Ex. 

  PW2/1.  However, since he had neither produced the site plan nor 

  he had been able to identify the signatures of the person appearing 

  on the said inspection book.  Hence, even his deposition is of no use 

  and   avail   to   the   plaintiff.     During   his   cross­examination   by   Ld. 

  Counsel for the defendant no.1, he had categorically stated that no 

  record with respect to the site plan was available with his office.  


</p><p id="p_34">16.PW4, wrongly numbered as PW3 was one Sh. Nagender Shah, UDC 

  from Land and Building  Department, who was examined twice in 

  this case, once on 28.11.2005 and secondly on 18.04.2007.  In his 

  deposition, he had stated that he had not brought any summoned 

  record as the same had been stolen and in respect of which an FIR 

  No. 117/03 had already been lodged at Police Station IP Estate.

  testimony of the witnesses, it has not been explained or clarified on 

  record as to how the plaintiff had acquired the knowledge about the 

  fact that the entire construction which was alleged to be illegal and 

  unauthorized in nature was carried out by the defendant no. 1 and 

  2 alone and not by any other person because plaintiff himself had 

  not been an eye witness to the said construction and he had rather 

  claimed himself to have seen the same completed only when he had 

  visited   the   said   premises   in   the   beginning   of   November,   1990. 

  However,   he   had   not   disclosed   the   source   from   whom   he   had 

  acquired knowledge of this fact that it was the defendant no. 1 and

   2,   who   had   entered   upon   his   property   and   had   raised   the   said 

  unauthorized construction nor even any such person was examined 

  as a witness in the present case.  Not only this, but also, even the 

  rent receipts allegedly issued by the defendant no.1 in favour of the 

  defendant   no.   5,   6,   7   and   8   had   also   not   been   duly   proved   on 

  record.  Similarly, no source has been cited by the plaintiff either in 

  his pleadings or during evidence regarding alleged illegal induction 

  of   the   defendant   no.   5   to   8   by   the   defendant   no.   1   and  2   in   an 

  unauthorized manner in the unauthorizedly constructed premises 

  by them.

</p><p id="p_37">18.In view of all these shortfalls, I have no hesitation in holding that 

  the plaintiff had miserably failed to prove his allegations contained 

  in the plaint even by the preponderance of probabilities.   Not only 

  this, but also, it is pertinent to mention and point out here itself 

  that even the site plan of the property has also not been proved in 

  accordance with law because same was never stated to have been 

  prepared either by the PW1 or at his instance.  Furthermore, it has 

  to   be   mentioned   here   itself   that   once   the   defendant   no.   1   had 

  specifically claimed about his own ownership in respect of the suit 

  property and had denied the title of the plaintiff herein, then the 

  proper course and remedy available to the plaintiff was to seek a 

  decree   for   declaration   qua   his   ownership   in   respect   of   the   suit 

  property and not to seek the remedy of an injunction simplicitor. 

  Furthermore, a perusal of the document which is certificate of sale 

  Ex. PW1/2, would make it amply clear that though it talks about 

  the  factum of property having been sold in favour of the plaintiff by 

  way of auction by the Custodian of Evacuee Property but it does not

   mention about the extent of area or dimensions of the constructed 

  portion of the same nor it mentioned about the rear portion of the 

  said   property   being   lying   vacant   and   the   same   was   being 

  constructed only up to ground floor and first floor in the front side 

  alone.
