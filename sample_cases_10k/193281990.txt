                                  IA ORDER


</p><p id="p_3">1.   This is an application for condonation of delay in filing
application for restoration of First Appeal, which was dismissed
for non-removal of office objection(s).
</p>

<p id="p_4">2.   Rule.      Mr.Swapneshwar            Goutam,       learned    Assistant
Government Pleader waives service of notice of Rule on behalf
of the State.
</p>

<p id="p_5">3.   Mr. Satyam Chhaya, learned advocate for the applicant
has submitted that the matter pertains to enhancement of
compensation             under   Land     Acquisition     Reference,    the
applicants are poor farmers, who at the relevant time had filed
appeal within reasonable time but because of some default in
payment of stamp duty, the matter stood dismissed for non
removal of office objection and thereafter, they could not keep
the track of the matter which led to this situation. It is further
submitted that, this appeal arises from the very same group of

Land Acquisition References, against which number of Appeals
are already entertained by this Court. Reference is made to
one of such order in First Appeal No.118 of 2013 and cognate
matters. It is submitted that, in the peculiar facts of the case,
delay be condoned.
</p>

<p id="p_6">4.      Mr. Swapneshwar Goutam, learned Assistant Government
Pleader has vehemently contested this application. It is
submitted that there is inordinate delay and therefore the
application       needs     to   be     dismissed.      Learned     Assistant
Government Pleader has also drawn the attention of this Court
to the consolidated affidavit in reply filed in this group of
applications.
</p>

<p id="p_7">5.      Having heard learned advocates for the respective
parties and having considered material on record this Court
finds that, it is not in dispute that appeal in question arises
from the very same group of Land Acquisition References,
against which number of Appeals are already entertained by
this Court. Reference in this regard can be made to First
Appeal No.118 of 2013 and cognate matters. The respondent
is the State Authority. The matter pertains to enhancement of
compensation           under     Land     Acquisition      Reference.    The
appellants are poor farmers. In this factual background, no
prejudice would be caused to the State, if the delay is
condoned and the appeal is heard on merits. Had the
respondent been a private litigant, this Court would have
considered imposing cost also, on the applicant, for allowing
this application, however, in the facts of this case, this Court
finds    that      the     Government       need     not    be    monetarily
compensated for the delay on the part of farmers, in

approaching this Court, that too when the delay is more the
procedural, less in substance. It is noted that, the appeal was
filed at the relevant time. Considering the totality, delay needs
to be condoned.
</p>

<p id="p_8">6.     For the reasons recorded above, this application is
allowed. Delay is condoned. Rule is made absolute.
