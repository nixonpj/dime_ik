<p id="p_1">          The petitioners herein seek a writ of mandamus

directing action, including criminal action, on a complaint

made by them before the third respondent.

</p><p id="p_2">          2.   The matter is concerning the amount of

compensation for land acquisition, disbursed by the 5th

respondent. The allegation of the petitioners is that only a

fraction of the compensation has come to court by way of

deposit, and the balance amount is still with the 4th

respondent.   It appears that the petitioners would allege

misappropriation by the 4th respondent. Now there is report

from the 4th respondent that the claimants have already

received the entire amount due, and they, in fact, have

received some excess amount. The statement filed by the

4th respondent contains the details of the deposits so far

made. The report further shows that the 4th respondent has

already initiated proceedings to realize the amount received

by the petitioners and others in excess.      In the present

circumstances where the petitioners and others have

already received the entire amount due from the 5th

respondent, there is no scope for a prosecution under the

<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_1">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, or under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2"> the Indian Penal

Code</a>.     Anyway, it is submitted by the learned Public

Prosecutor that the Vigilance has not so far received any

complaint from the petitioners, and so, there is no question

of initiating any action. The petitioners have produced a

copy of the complaint. But the VACB is definite that the

Vigilance has not so far received any such complaint.

Anyway, the report of the 4th respondent shows that there is

no scope for any sort of proceeding now, because, the entire

amount of compensation stands          deposited, and the

claimants including the petitioners, have received the entire

amount due.      If so, there is no question of any sort of

criminal misappropriation or misconduct. I find no reason

for any sort of orders in this writ petition in the above

circumstances. The report submitted by the 4th respondent

is recorded.
