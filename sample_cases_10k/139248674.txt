(SRI. SHIVARUDRAPPA SHETKAR, ADV. FOR R1
R2 IS SERVED AND UNREPRESENTED)
                          ---

      This Criminal Petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of
Cr.P.C., praying to set aside the order dated 26.11.2014
(Annexure-B) passed by the XIV Addl. C.M.M., Bengaluru
taking cognizance of the compliant against the petitioner in
C.C.NO.56316/14 which after transfer is now pending before
the LVIII Addl. C.M.M., Bengaluru etc.

      This Petition coming on for Admission this day, the
Court made the following:-


                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned counsel appearing for the respondent No.1.



</p><p id="p_2">     2. Respondent No.2 who is the accused No.1

before the Trial Court, though served with notice,

remained absent.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">     3. The main contention of the learned counsel for

the petitioner is that the complainant has lodged a

complaint under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_2">Section 138</a> of Negotiable Instruments
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              3</span>


Act, 1881 though the petitioner is neither a drawer of

the Cheque nor there was transaction between the

complainant and the 2nd accused. Therefore, as per the

<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_3">Negotiable Instruments Act</a>, <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_4">Section 138</a> of the Act is

not constituted against the petitioner.



</p><p id="p_5">      3. The records discloses that the complainant has

stated that the accused No.1 (respondent No.2 herein)

has represented to the complaint that he is the

authorized agent of accused No.2 (petitioner) and has a

valid contract with accused No.2 wherein the accused

No.1 authorised and permitted to market, receive orders

and receive payments on behalf of accused No.2.         In

that context, it is alleged that the complainant has

placed order for 3KW Power pack with accused No.1 to

be supplied by accused No.2. But the said power pack

was   not   supplied   nor   installed.   Therefore,   the

complainant has demanded accused No.1 and in turn,

accused No.1 has given two Cheques which are involved

in this particular case and the said Cheques were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  4</span>


presented and dishonoured on the ground of funds

insufficient.    On the basis of such facts, the complaint

came to be filed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">      4. Admittedly, the complainant has never stated

that, he has got any direct dealing with accused No.2

and has any contract and on behalf of accused No.2,

accused No.1 has issued any Cheque or the Cheque

belonging       to    accused   No.2   has   been   issued   as

authorized signatory of accused No.1.



</p><p id="p_8">      5. In the absence of elucidation of such facts, as

the petitioner is not the drawer of the Cheque which has

been specifically alleged to have been issued by accused

No.1 which is a separate entity compared to accused

No.2, in my opinion, such complaint is not maintainable

particularly         under   <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_5">Section   138</a>    of    Negotiable

Instruments Act against the petitioner (accused No.2)

before the Trial Court.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               5</span><p id="p_9">


</p><p id="p_10">       6. Under the above such circumstances, I do not

find   any    strong      reasons    to   continue    the   said

prosecution     against    accused    No.2.       Hence,      the

proceedings in C.C.No.56316/14 pending on the file of

the 58th Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and all

further   proceedings     insofar    as   this   petitioner    is

concerned is hereby quashed.

</p><p id="p_13">                                              JUDGE
