        Insurance company not led any evidence. Driver and owner remained exparte. 



</p><p id="p_21">    10. After hearing arguments and considering the material on record, my issue­wise 

        finding is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_22">

        Issue No.1 (Negligence): 
</p>
<p id="p_23">    11. PW1 Sunil Kumar injured witness in the accident in his affidavit of evidence 

        categorically stated that at the time of accident, he was sitting as a pillion rider 

        on   the   motorcycle   driven   by   the   deceased,   and   motorcycle   was   hit   by   the 

        offending truck driven by R1 in rash and negligent manner, thereby he received 

        grievous  injuries  on  his  leg  and  deceased  suffered  fatal  injuries  in  the  said 

        accident. Nothing material came in cross examination to discredit his version 

Suit no.563/12, Savitri Devi &amp; Ors Vs Hariram Bishnoi &amp; Ors, ( page no­4 of 15)
         on the factum of negligence of R1. His statement is duly supported by police 

        investigation.   Police during investigation also found respondent no.1 accused 

        of   rash   and   negligent   driving,   hence   chargesheeted   him   for   commission   of 

        offence   u/s   279/338/304A/427   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a>.   No   evidence   to   the   contrary   led   by 

        respondent driver and owner. 
</p>
<p id="p_24">

</p><p id="p_25">    12. To determine the negligence of the driver of the offending vehicle, I am being 

        guided by the judgment of Hon'ble High Court in case titled "Basant Kaur &amp;  

        Ors Vs. Chattar Pal Singh and Ors" [2003 ACJ 369 MP (DB)], wherein it has 

        been held that registration of a criminal case against the driver of the offending 

        vehicle is enough to record the finding that the driver of offending vehicle is 

        responsible for causing the accident. Further it has been held in catena of cases 

        that   the   proceedings   under   the   <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_8">Motor   Vehicles   Act</a>   are   not   akin   to   the 

        proceedings as in  civil suit and hence strict rules of evidence are not required 

        to   be   followed   in   this   regard.   I   am   also   being   guided   by   the   judgment   of 

        Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in  "National Insurance Company Limited Vs.  

        Pushpa Rana" (2009 ACJ 287), wherein it was held that in case the petitioner 

        files the certified copy of the criminal record or the criminal record showing 

        the completion of the investigation by the police or the issuance of charge sheet 

        under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_9">Section  279</a>/<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_10">304</a> A IPC or the certified copy of the FIR or in addition 

        the   recovery   memo   or   the   mechanical   inspection   report   of   the   offending 

        vehicle, these documents are sufficient proof to reach to the conclusion that the 

        driver was negligent. It is also settled law that the term rashness and negligence 

        has to be constructed lightly while making a decision on a petition for claim for 



Suit no.563/12, Savitri Devi &amp; Ors Vs Hariram Bishnoi &amp; Ors, ( page no­5 of 15)
         the same as compared to the word rashness and negligence as finds mention in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11"> 

        the Indian Penal Code</a>. This is because the chapter in the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_12">Motor Vehicle Act</a> 

        dealing with compensation is a benevolent legislation and not a penal one. 



</p><p id="p_26">    13. In view of the above discussion, petitioner able to prove that deceased suffered 

        fatal injuries due to rash and negligent driving of the R­1. Accordingly the issue 

        no. 1 is decided in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. 



        Issue no. 2  Compensation: 
</p>
<p id="p_27">    14. Apex Court in  Sarla Verma Vs. DTC (AIR 2009 SC 3104)  comprehensively 

        dealt with the relevant principals relating to the assessment of compensation in 

        death   cases.   Apex   Court   in   this   case   observed   that   in   fatal   accident,   the 

        measure of damage is pecuniary loss suffered or likely to be suffered by each 

        dependent   as   a   result   of   death,   and   basically   only   three   facts   need   to   be 

        established by the claimants for assessing compensation in case of death: (a) 

        age of the deceased or claimant whichever is higher, (b) income of the deceased 

        and  (c) number of dependents.

        applicable for unskilled labour on date of accident i.e 26.08.2012 is Rs. 7020/­

        2013(6) SCALE 563", directed  Tribunals that irrespective of the claims made 

        in the   application,  the  Tribunals  are  required  to  award compensation  which 

        should be just equitable and reasonable. In this regard, the Hon'ble apex court 

        revisited   the   amount   of   compensation   under   conventional   heads   of   loss   of 

        consortium , loss of love and affection and funeral expenses. Apex court in para 

        no. 20 &amp; 21 held as under:

<p id="p_40">

</p><p id="p_41">    22. "The ratio of a decision of this Court, on a legal issue is a precedent. But an  

        observation made by this Court, mainly to achieve uniformity and consistency  

        on   a   socio­economic   issue,   as   contrasted   from   a   legal   principle,   though   a  

        precedent, can be, and in fact ought to be periodically revisited, as observed in  

        Santosh   Devi   (Supra).   We   may,   therefore,   revisit   the   practice   of   awarding  

        compensation under conventional heads: loss of consortium to the spouse, loss  

        of love , care and guidance to children and funeral expense. It may be noted  

        that the sum of Rs. 2,500/­ to Rs. 10,000/­ in those heads was fixed several  

        decades   ago   and   having   regard   to   inflation   factor,   the   same   needs   to   be  

        increased. In Sarla Verma's case (Supra), it was held that compensation for  

        loss of consortium should be in the range of Rs. 5000/­ to Rs. 10,000/­. In Legal  


Suit no.563/12, Savitri Devi &amp; Ors Vs Hariram Bishnoi &amp; Ors, ( page no­8 of 15)
         parlance, 'consortium' is the right of the spouse to the company, care, help,  

        comfort, guidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his or  

        her   mate.   That   non­pecuniary   head   of   damage   has   not   been   properly  

        understood   by   our   Courts.   The   loss   of   companionship,   love,   care   and  

        protection,   etc.,   the   spouse   is   entitled   to   get,   has   to   be   compensated  

        appropriately. The concept of non­pecuniary damage for loss of consortium is  

        one of the major heads of award of compensation in other parts of the world  

        more   particularly   in   the   United   States   of   America,   Australia,   etc.   English  

        Courts have also recognized the right of a spouse to get compensation even  

        during the period of temporary disablement. By loss of consortium, the courts  

        have made an attempt to compensate the loss of spouse's   affection, comfort,  

        solace,   companionship,   society,   assistance,   protection,   care   and   sexual  

        relations during the future years. Unlike the compensation awarded in other  

        countries   and   other   jurisdictions,   since   the   legal   heirs   are   otherwise  

        adequately   compensated   for   the   pecuniary   loss,   it   would   not   be   proper   to  

        award a major amount under this head.  Hence, we are of the view that it  

        would only be just and reasonable that the courts award at least rupees one  

        lakh for loss of consortium. 
</p>
<p id="p_42">

</p><p id="p_43">    23. We may also take judicial notice of the fact that the Tribunals have been  

        quite frugal with regard to award of compensation under the head of 'funeral  

        Expenses'. The 'Price Index', it is a fact has gone up in that regard also. The  

        head 'Funeral Expenses' does not mean the fee paid in the crematorium or fee  

        paid for the use of space in the cemetery. There are many other expenses in  


Suit no.563/12, Savitri Devi &amp; Ors Vs Hariram Bishnoi &amp; Ors, ( page no­9 of 15)
         connection   with   funeral   and   if   the   deceased   is   follower   of   any   particular  

        religion,   there   are   several   religious   practices   and   conventions   pursuant   to  

        death in a family. All those are quite expensive. Therefore, we are of the view  

        that it will be just, fair and equitable, under the head of 'Funeral Expenses', in  

        the absence of evidence to the contrary for higher expenses, to award at least  

        an amount of Rs. 25,000/­.
