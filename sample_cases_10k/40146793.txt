</p>
<p id="p_4">7/16.03.2018     Apprehending his arrest, the petitioner has moved this Court
        for grant of privilege of anticipatory bail in connection with C.P. Case
        No. 2781 of 2016 registered under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_1">Section 498A</a> of the Indian Penal
        Code.
</p><p id="p_5">                 Heard the parties.
</p><p id="p_6">                 The petitioner and opposite party no. 2 are physically present
        before this Court.
</p><p id="p_7">                 Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner
        is ready and willing to resume his conjugal life with opposite party
        no. 2 and will keep and maintain her as his lawfully wedded wife with
        full honour and dignity but opposite party no. 2 is not ready to
        resume her conjugal life with the petitioner because of his past
        conduct.
</p><p id="p_8">                 It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that the
        allegations against the petitioner regarding treatment with cruelty
        and demand of dowry are false and there is general and omnibus
        allegation against the petitioner. It is further submitted that the
        petitioner is ready and willing to pay Rs. 50,000/- as ad interim
        victim compensation to the victim-O.P. No. 2, by way of demand
        draft, without prejudice to his defence in the case. Hence, the
        petitioner may be given the privilege of anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_9">                 Learned Addl. P.P., assisted by opposite party no. 2, opposes
        the prayer for anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_10">                 Considering the submissions of the counsel and the fact as
        discussed above, I am of the opinion that this is a fit case where the
        petitioner, named above, be admitted to anticipatory bail. Hence, in
        the event of his arrest or surrender within a period of eight weeks
        from the date of this order, he shall be released on bail on depositing
        demand draft of Rs.50,000/- drawn in favour of the victim-O.P. No. 2
       as ad interim victim compensation and furnishing bail bond of Rs.
      10,000/-(Rupees Ten Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount
      each to the satisfaction of learned J.M., 1st Class, Dhanbad, in
      connection with C.P. Case No. 2781 of 2016, subject to the
      conditions laid down under <a href="/doc/1144664/" id="a_2">section 438</a> (2) Cr. P.C.
</p><p id="p_11">             In case, the petitioner deposits the said demand draft of
      Rs.50,000/- in the court, it is directed that notice be issued to
      victim-O.P. No. 2 and the said demand draft be released in her
      favour forthwith, after proper identification. In case of the amount of
      Rs.50,000/- is deposited by the petitioner, the same will be adjusted
      towards the maintenance in any present or future proceeding
      between the parties.
