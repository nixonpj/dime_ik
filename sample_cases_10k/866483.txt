              HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH.

                               CRM No. M-1567 of 2009 (O&amp;M)
                               Date of decision: 18.03.2009

Smt. Gurbachan Kaur                                  ...Petitioner

                            Versus

Smt. Rajwinder Kaur &amp; others                         ...Respondents


CORAM:      HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJAN GUPTA

Present:    Mr. Arun Takhi, Advocate, for the petitioner.

Rajan Gupta, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            The present petition has been preferred against the order

passed by the courts below whereby property of the petitioner was

directed to be attached and warrant of sale issued in execution of an

order passed under Section 125 (3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            Brief factual background of the case is that wife (Rajwinder

Kaur) and son (Gurjot Singh) of Narinder Singh filed an application

under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_2">Section 125</a> (3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3">Cr.P.C</a>. for effecting recovery of maintenance

granted by the court to the tune of Rs.85,800/-. Resultantly, the trial

court vide its order dated 18th November, 2006, issued warrant of

attachment to attach 1/3rd share of the land standing in the name of Jagat

Singh father of Narinder Singh. The trial court issued the warrant of

attachment on the basis of an affidavit filed by Rajwinder Kaur wife of

Narinder Singh that Narinder Singh had 1/3rd share in the land owned by

Jagat Singh. Thus, 1/3rd share of the said land was attached and report
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">  CRM No. M-1567 of 2009                        2</span>


in this regard was received by the trial court on 4th January, 2007.

However, the present petitioner, who is wife of Jagat Singh, filed an

application objecting to the attachment. She relied upon a will dated

24th September, 1984 to contend that the land in question has been

bequeathed to her. She thus submitted that the attachment could not

stand. Her objections were, however, rejected by the Judicial Magistrate

1st Class, Jagadhri vide order dated 31st October, 2007 (Annexure P-5).

The said order was affirmed by Additional Sessions Judge, Yamuna

Nagar vide order dated 16th September, 2008 (Annexure P-11). The

present petition has been filed impugning the orders passed by the

courts below as being illegal and arbitrary.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner and given

careful thoughts to the facts of the instant case.

</p><p id="p_4">             It is evident that wife and son (respondents No.1 &amp; 2

herein) were granted maintenance under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_4">Section 125</a> Cr.P.C. way back

on 17th December, 2003. However, having failed to realize the arrears

of maintenance, an application under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_5">Section 125</a> (3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a>. was

moved on 15th January, 2004. The husband (respondent No.3 herein)

refused to comply with the order. Instead an application was moved by

his mother relying upon a will dated 24th September, 1984 to contend

that Jagat Singh, father of Narinder Singh had bequeathed his property

in favour of his wife, the petitioner herein, and thus there could be no

execution against the said property.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             It is also evident from the record that the present petitioner
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">  CRM No. M-1567 of 2009                        3</span>


as well as her son Narinder Singh, both were accused in a case under

<a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_7">Sections 406</a>, <a href="/doc/1868826/" id="a_8">498</a> IPC. Both Narinder Singh respondent No.3 herein

and his mother, the present petitioner, were proclaimed offenders in the

said case.   However, the petitioner later appeared and got anticipatory

bail. Thus, possibility that the application objecting to execution was

filed in collusion with each other only with a view to defeat the order of

attachment of property, cannot be ruled out.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             While rejecting the objections of the petitioner, the trial

court passed a detailed and reasoned order which was upheld by the

Additional Sessions Judge, Yamuna Nagar. The revisional court also

dealt with all the contentions of the petitioner and came to the

conclusion that mother of Narinder Singh had filed the application just

to frustrate the execution of the order granting maintenance to wife and

son of Narinder Singh.      The application was filed relying upon a

purported will executed on a plain paper. This apart, the court also

noticed that Jagat Singh, father of respondent No.3, had already died

and Narinder Singh was one of his natural heirs. The court also came to

the conclusion that proceedings under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_9">Section 125</a> Cr.P.C. were

summary proceedings in which the Magistrate was not required to

decide the question of title. The court also observed that the will in

question had not seen the light of the day for 22 years after death of

Jagat Singh.   It was not presented by the petitioner to the revenue

authorities for entering the mutation in her favour for inexplicably long

delay. It is only after the land was ordered to be attached that the will
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">   CRM No. M-1567 of 2009                       4</span>


surfaced.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            Learned counsel for the petitioner has not been able to point

out any legal infirmity with the order under challenge.

</p><p id="p_8">            I thus find no ground to interfere in inherent jurisdiction of

this court for quashing the orders (Annexures P-5 &amp; P-11).

</p><p id="p_9">            No other point has been argued.
</p>
<p id="p_10">            The petition is, thus dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">                                                   (RAJAN GUPTA)
