 that on 17.04.2014 at about 12.00 pm and on 18.04.2014 at House
No.69, Gali No.29, South Anarkali, Gurudwara Gali, Delhi within the
jurisdiction of PS Jagatpuri, the accused since convicted being uncle
(Mausa) of the prosecutrix, repeatedly committed rape on the
prosecutrix aged about 18 ½ years against her will and consent and
also threatened to kill her if she reported the incident to anyone and
thus criminally intimidated her and committed offences punishable
under <a href="/doc/334057/" id="a_9">Section 376(2)(f)</a> and <a href="/doc/1677485/" id="a_10">Section 376(2)(n)</a> of the Indian Penal
Code, 1860 read with <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_11">Section 506</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, to
which charge of allegations, the accused/appellant herein had pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.     The charge-sheet in the instant case indicates that on
25.04.2014, the prosecutrix (P) aged 18 ½ years accompanied her
aunt(Y) i.e. her mausi to the police station and got her complaint
registered to the effect that she was a permanent resident of Jabalpur,
Madhya Pradesh and had come to her maternal aunt's (Y) house a few
days before so that she could visit the city and that she also used to
accompany her aunt (Y) in doing the domestic work of cleaning in
houses.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.     As per the prosecution version set forth through the FIR, the
accused/appellant herein named Billo used to do the work of POP and
on 17.04.2014, her mausa i.e. the accused/appellant herein told her
not to go for the work or she would get into the bad habit of eating pan
supari and thus her aunt (Y) left for work and the son of her aunt (A)
had also gone for work and his sister (B) had gone to school and she

 the prosecutrix (P) and her uncle named Biloo were alone at home and
that she was cleaning utensils and thereafter went for a bath and at that
time her uncle i.e. the accused/ appellant herein entered the bath room
making an excuse that he wanted to take water and that she objected to
the same on which her uncle told her not to make any noise and that
he would give her Rs.l000/- and would give Rs.5000/- to her mother
and would get her new shoes and chappals and that she should do
whatever he asked her to do so and told her to do as he said and her
uncle came out of the bath room and after she bathed she wore her
clothes and came out of the bath room and her uncle i.e. the
accused/appellant herein asked her to come and lie down on a Chatai
(Mat) and when she refused to do so, he caught hold of her and made
her lie down on the floor and put her chunni into her mouth and with
his legs he pressed her hands and kept fondling her breasts with his
hands and then opened the Naada (string) of her salwar and took it off
and forcibly put his penis into her vagina and thereafter left her alone
in the house and went out of the house and before leaving the house he
also threatened her to keep her mouth shut or else he would kill her.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.     As per the FIR, the prosecutrix (P) is indicated to have stated
that her uncle i.e. the accused/appellant herein was a very cruel man
and also used to beat her maternal aunt (Y) and their children
mercilessly. As per the FIR, the prosecutrix (P) further reported that
because of the acts of her uncle i.e. the accused/ appellant herein she
was in a state of fear and on 18.04.2014 her uncle i.e. the
accused/appellant herein on finding an opportunity after her maternal




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CRL.A 378/17                                                 Page 4 of 43</span>
 aunt (Y) and her cousin brother and sister had left, again had sexual
intercourse with her and she being very afraid of the acts of her uncle
i.e. the accused/appellant herein did not tell anyone of the same but on
that day i.e. on 25.04.2014, she picked up the courage and told her
maternal aunt (Y) about everything and her aunt (Y) brought her to the
police station and then she told everything to the police in the presence
of her aunt (Y) and her statement was recorded. As per the charge-
sheet on the basis of the statement of the prosecutrix (P), the FIR was
registered under <a href="/doc/334057/" id="a_12">Section 376(2)(f)</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_13">Section 506</a> of the Indian Penal
Code, 1860.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.     The medical examination of the prosecutrix (P) was got
conducted at LBS Hospital through ASI Sunita. The statement of the
maternal aunt (Y) of the prosecutrix (P) was also indicated to have
been recorded and as she had no documentary proof of age, the bone
age X-Ray of the prosecutrix was also got conducted. The
accused/appellant herein was taken into custody on 26.04.2014 and
samples collected during the medical examination of the prosecutrix
(P) and the accused/appellant herein were deposited in the Malkhana.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.     In support of the prosecution version, the State cited and
examined its 16 witnesses. It was held by the learned Trial Court vide
the impugned judgment that the charge of allegations levelled against
the accused/appellant herein (uncle of the prosecutrix) established that
the accused/appellant herein had committed acts of sexual intercourse
with the prosecutrix (P) on 17.04.2014 and 18.04.2014 by force and
without her consent and that the accused i.e. the appellant herein had




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CRL.A 378/17                                                 Page 5 of 43</span>
 also threatened to kill her after the acts of commission of rape upon
her.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.     Through the present appeal and submissions made on behalf of
the appellant by the learned counsel from the Delhi High Court Legal
Services Committee, Ms. Aishwarya Rao, it was contended that the
charge of allegations framed against the accused/appellant herein were
not proved nor established even remotely. It was also submitted on
behalf of the appellant that there were contradictions and variations in
the testimonies of the prosecutrix (P) examined as PW-3 and PW-5
Ms. Y i.e. the maternal aunt of the prosecutrix as to the date when the
aunt (Y) of the prosecutrix was informed by the prosecutrix of the
alleged incidents of the dates 17.04.2014 and 18.04.2014 and whereas
the prosecutrix stated that she had informed her aunt i.e. PW-5 after
2/4 days of the incident of rape committed on her, her aunt (Y) had
stated in her cross-examination that the prosecutrix had told her about
the commission of rape on her person by the accused/appellant herein
in the evening of 17.04.2014 for the first time and that she, the aunt
(Y) of the prosecutrix (P) did not lodge any report to the police on
17.04.2017 nor did she so report about the same to the police by the
prosecutrix (P) and despite the alleged second rape on 18.04.2014 by
the accused/appellant herein on the prosecutrix (P) there was no
reporting of the FIR till date 25.04.2014. It was also contended on
behalf of the appellant that there was no medical evidence to prove
that the prosecutrix (P) had been subjected to any sexual assault by the
appellant nor was there any FSL report to show the involvement of the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CRL.A 378/17                                                Page 6 of 43</span>
 appellant with the offence in question or to prove that the prosecutrix
was subjected to rape by the appellant. Inter alia         the appellant
contended that the facsimile of the seal used in sealing the seized
articles had not been taken on any of the documents e.g. Seizure
memos etc. nor was the seal handed over to any person through any
seizure memo and nor was the same deposited with the MHC(M) of
the police station. It was further contended on behalf of the appellant
that the learned Trial Court had failed to appreciate that the scientific
evidence does not corroborate the story of prosecution and that there
were no efforts made by the prosecution to ascertain the presence of
the Smegma on the glans penis of the accused/appellant herein and
reliance was placed on behalf of the appellant on the verdict of the
Hon'ble High Court of Orissa in "A. Kamartaju Patro Versus State
of Orissa (1991 Crl. L.J.) 2009" with specific observations therein to
the effect:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "the Smegma Test of the accused is a sure and
        infallible test to determine whether the male agent in
        the offence of rape had actually committed sexual
        intercourse or not and in absence of such test for the
        want of medical examination of the Petitioner/Convict,
        it is submitted that the Petitioner/Convict cannot be
        said have committed the offence of rape."
</blockquote><p id="p_11">10.    Inter alia it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the
appellant had not received a fair trial and that his conviction could not
be sustained and that the extreme penalties imposed by the learned
Trial Court ought to be set aside. It was also submitted on behalf of
the   appellant   that   no   fair   opportunity   was   given    to    the
accused/appellant herein to defend his case properly and even the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CRL.A 378/17                                                 Page 7 of 43</span>
 Amicus Curiae provided to the appellant did not render proper
assistance in a manner to properly contest the case and most of the
relevant questions which ought to have been put to the witnesses, were
not asked to the witnesses during cross-examination. It was also
submitted on behalf of the appellant that there was no bleeding after
the alleged incident of rape on the prosecution and no injuries on her
person which also negate the commission of the offence of rape inter
alia the appellant contended that the testimony of a child witness has
to be guaged with caution and reliance was placed thus on the verdict
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in "Nivrutti Pandurang Kokate &amp;
Ors. Vs. State of Maharashtra, AIR 2008 SC 1460", wherein there
were observations to the effect:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">        "The decision on the question whether the child witness
        has sufficient intelligence primarily rests with the trial
        Judge who notices his manners, his apparent
        possession or lack of intelligence, and the said Judge
        may resort to any examination which will tend to
        disclose his capacity and intelligence as well as his
        understanding of the obligation of an oath. The
        decision of the trial court may, however, be disturbed
        by the higher court if from what is preserved in the
        records, it is clear that his conclusion was erroneous.
        This precaution is necessary because child witnesses
        are amenable to tutoring and often live in a world of
        make-believe. Though it is an established principle that
        child witnesses are dangerous witnesses as they are
        pliable and liable to be influenced easily, shapes and
        molded, but it is also an accepted norm that if after
        careful scrutiny of their evidence the court comes to the
        conclusion that there is an impress of truth in it, there is
        no obstacle in the way of accepting the evidence of a
        child witness."
</blockquote>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CRL.A 378/17                                                  Page 8 of 43</span>
<p id="p_12"> 11.    Inter alia it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the
learned Trial Court did not frame any opinion as to whether the child
witness has the requisite intelligence to depose and whether she was
tutored or not and that the appellant was convicted on the sole
testimony of the prosecutrix which itself does not inspire confidence
and appeared to be tutored. It was further contended on behalf of the
appellant that the prosecution story was thoroughly inconsistent and
illogical and that the learned Trial Court erred in granting benefit of
doubt to the appellant as the prosecution has not been able to
discharge its burden. It was thus submitted on behalf of the appellant
that the appellant was liable to be acquitted.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.    On behalf of the State, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for
State Ms. Aashaa Tiwari contended that the statement of the
prosecutrix stood corroborated through the statement of the aunt (Y)
of the prosecutrix i.e. PW-5 to the extent that the prosecutrix had
disclosed the incident to her aunt (Y) and that thereafter she, the aunt
(Y) of the prosecutrix along with the prosecutrix (P) had gone to the
Police Station Jagatpuri and got the FIR Ex. PW3/C registered against
the accused/appellant. It was also submitted on behalf of the State that
the accused/appellant herein was the husband of PW-5 and that the
parents of the prosecutrix would have sent the prosecutrix to Delhi
based on their trust but in view of the incident that took place, the
same would have placed PW-5 in a substantial dilemma and even
presuming that PW-5 came to know what incident on the date of the
incident, the delay of one week in the registration of the FIR was itself




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CRL.A 378/17                                                 Page 9 of 43</span>
 no ground to disbelieve the case of the prosecutrix.
</p>
<p id="p_14">13.    Reliance was thus placed on behalf of the State on the verdict of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in "State of Punjab &amp; Ors. Vs. Gurmeet
Singh" 1996 (2) SCC 4384, on the verdict of the Hon'ble High Court
of Himachal Pradesh in "State of Himachal Pradesh Vs. Sanjay
Kumar @ Jimmy" a judgment dated 15.12.2000 Crl A. 1231/16 in
which the delay of three years was condoned. Reliance was also
placed on behalf of the appellant on the verdict of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in "Satpal Singh Vs. State of Haryana" 2010 (8)
SCC 719 in which the delay of four months in reporting the matter to
the police was not considered very significant. It has been submitted
on behalf of the State that pursuant to the incident of rape and the
medical examination of the prosecutrix (P) would have taken a bath
and attended to the calls of nature and the absence of semen in the
samples from the body of the prosecutrix (P) cannot be considered
very significant and that the absence of injuries on the body of the
prosecutrix (P) is also of no consequence. It has also been submitted
through the written submissions of the State that at the time of the
incident, the prosecutrix (P) was 18 ½ years of age and that she was
alone in the house of the accused which was far away from her native
place which itself indicated that she would not have been in a position
to offer resistance to the accused/appellant herein and furthermore, the
FIR itself indicated that the accused/appellant herein had been beating
his wife and his children.

 State of M.P." 2007 Crl. J. 4704 categorically lays down to the effect
that a finding of guilt in a case can be based on uncorroborated
evidence of the prosecutrix and the very nature of the offence made it
difficult to get direct corroborative evidence and that the evidence of
the prosecutrix ought not to be rejected on the basis of            minor
discrepancies and contradictions and where a victim states on oath that
she was forcibly subjected to sexual intercourse, her statement would
ordinarily be accepted even if it is uncorroborated and it is was also
contended on behalf of the State that it is well settled that the absence
of injuries on the private parts of the victim do not ipso facto falsify a
case and that the same cannot be construed as evidence of consent and
that further the opinion of a doctor that there was no evidence of any
sexual intercourse or rape is also not sufficient to disbelieve the
accusation of rape on the victim.

NOIDA. The accused inter alia through his statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_22">Section
313</a> Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 apart from denying the
incriminating evidence led against him stated that the witnesses cited
are interested witnesses and he was having a matrimonial dispute with
his wife and stated that he did not have any relation with his elder
daughter as she had run away with a boy without information and
stated that the prosecutrix had falsely implicated him at the instance of
his wife and his daughter and his wife wanted to send him to jail but
could not succeed. Though an opportunity was sought by the accused
i.e. the appellant herein to lead defence evidence but no such defence
evidence was led by him.

<p id="p_28"> 25.    On a consideration of the entire available record and the
submissions that have been made on behalf of either side, it is
essential to observe that the testimonies of PW3 and PW11, the
statement under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_23">Section 164</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
of the prosecutrix and the testimony recorded of the prosecutrix in
Court and the averments made in the FIR in question bring forth that
there is a categorical consistency in relation to the commission of rape
of the prosecutrix by the accused on 17.04.2014 and 18.04.2014.
Undoubtedly as observed elsewhere hereinabove, the allegations in
relation to the mode of occurrence however, the statement which
forms the basis of the FIR and the testimony and witnesses are both
identical in relation to the material particulars that the prosecutrix
washed her clothes after the incident and thus the same brings forth
that there could be no semen stains on the clothes of the prosecutrix.
</p>
<p id="p_29">26.    Though, no injuries were found on the person of the prosecutrix
as per the MLC Ex.PW1/A and there was no discharge or bleeding
and no fresh tear, nevertheless the hymen was shown to be torn.
Significantly, the prosecutrix had stated at the time of the conducting
of the MLC that she wanted her medical test conducted and had also
stated to the doctor that the accused had committed sexual assault
upon her twice and had threatened that he would kill her if she told
about the same to anyone.
</p>
<p id="p_30">27.    As per the FSL report dated 29.06.2015 Ex.PW16/D, two
sealed parcels qua FIR No. 251/14, PS Jagatpuri were received on
29.04.2014 for DNA fingerprinting and indicated that there was no

 semen found on any of the exhibits and thus there was no DNA
analysis conducted. It has thus been contended on behalf of the
appellant as already adverted to hereinabove that with the available
record through the variations in the testimony of the prosecutrix from
her testimony under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_24">Section 164</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 in relation to the sequences of events and also the variations in
the testimony of PW-5 i.e. Aunt of the prosecutrix and the prosecutrix
coupled with the factum that PW-5 despite having learnt about the
stated rape committed on the prosecutrix by the accused on
17.04.2014 and 18.04.2014 also did not lodge the complaint to the
police till the date 25.04.2014 and it was thus submitted on behalf of
the accused i.e. the appellant herein that the said delay in the
registration of the FIR is thus fatal to the prosecution version. It was
also submitted on behalf of the appellant that the factum that there
were matrimonial disputes between the accused and PW-5 i.e. the
Aunt of the prosecutrix coupled with the factum that PW-5 i.e. the
Aunt of the prosecutrix had called the police several times on the
complaints made by her but as stated by the prosecutrix that the police
had never arrested the accused, coupled with the statement of the
prosecutrix that the lady with whom the Aunt of the prosecutrix
worked, had told her that she could get the accused/appellant herein
jailed whenever she wanted, and that she used to tell to PW-5 that she
should get the accused/appellant arrested because of the domestic
maltreatment meted out to her, it has been submitted on behalf of the
accused/appellant that the appellant had clearly been falsely
implicated in the instant case and ought to be acquitted.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">CRL.A 378/17                                                Page 25 of 43</span>
<p id="p_31"> 28.    On behalf of the State, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor
for the State vehemently refuted the contentions raised on behalf of
the appellant and contended that the testimony of the prosecutrix was
consistent in relation to the material particulars in relation to the rape
committed on her twice forcibly by the accused and of the threats
meted out to her in the event of her making any complaint to anyone
of the incidents of rape committed upon her by the accused. It is also
contended on behalf of the State that the medical examination of the
prosecutrix was conducted only on 25.04.2014 in relation to the
incident of rape on 17.04.2014 and 18.04.2014 and thus as the
prosecutrix had stated that she had washed her clothes after the
incident, thus there was no possibility of any semen and thus the
absence of any semen found in the report of the FSL did not in any
manner suffice to detract from the veracity of the allegations leveled
against the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_32">29.    It was also submitted on behalf of the State that the delay in the
registration of the FIR in the instant case was clearly understandable,
taking into account the factum that the accused was the spouse of
PW-5 i.e. Aunt (Y) of the prosecutrix and thus there was delay in the
registration of the FIR.
</p>
<p id="p_33">30.    Another contention raised on behalf of the appellant was that
the uncorroborated testimony of the prosecutrix in the facts and
circumstances of the instant case did not suffice to bring forth the
allegations levelled against the appellant herein beyond a reasonable
doubt qua the charge of allegations in the instant case against the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">CRL.A 378/17                                                 Page 26 of 43</span>
 accused/appellant herein qua the commission of the offence
punishable under <a href="/doc/482448/" id="a_25">Section 376(2)(f)</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1677485/" id="a_26">Section 376(2)(n)</a> of the Indian
Penal Code, 1860 apart from charge of allegations qua the offence
punishable under <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_27">Section 506</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
</p>
<p id="p_34">31.    On a consideration of the entire available record and rival
submissions made on behalf of either side it is held that there is no
infirmity in the impugned judgment of the learned Trial Court
inasmuch as, as already observed hereinabove there is an inherent
natural consistency in the testimony of the prosecutrix (P) in relation
to the occurrences of rape having been committed upon her by the
accused/appellant on 17.04.2014 and 18.04.2014. The factum that
there was a delay in the registration of the FIR which was registered
on 25.04.2014 as observed hereinabove, was rightly held to be
understandable by the learned Trial Court, taking into account the
factum that the accused/appellant herein is the husband of the
maternal aunt (Y) of the prosecutrix (P) and the prosecutrix (P) in fact
stayed at the house of the maternal aunt (Y) and that of the
accused/appellant when the offence of rape was committed upon her
by the accused/appellant herein when there was no one else at home
apart from the prosecutrix(P) and the accused/appellant herein. That
the accused was the husband of the maternal aunt (Y) of the
prosecutrix coupled with the factum that the prosecutrix was under a
threat that she would be killed if she told anyone of the commission of
rape on her by the accused/appellant, all make it apparent that the
delay in the registration of the FIR in the instant case is not fatal.

<p id="p_35"> 32.    The verdict of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in "State of Punjab
Vs. Gurmit Singh" AIR 1996 SC 1393 lays down categorically that
the Courts cannot overlook the fact that in sexual offences delay in the
lodging of the FIR can be due to variety of reasons particularly the
reluctance of the prosecutrix or her family members to go to the police
and complain about the incident which concerns the reputation of the
prosecutrix and the honour of her family and it is only after giving it a
cool thought that a complaint of sexual offence is generally lodged. To
similar effect are the observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
"State of Himachal Pradesh Vs. Sanjay Kumar @ Sunny" 2016
(12) SCALE 831 wherein, it has been observed to the effect:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">               24. When the matter is examined in the aforesaid
               perspective, which in the opinion of this Court is
               the right perspective, reluctance on the part of the
               prosecutrix in not narrating the incident to
               anybody for a period of three years and not sharing
               the same event with her mother, is clearly
               understandable. We would like to extract the
               following passage from the judgment of this Court
               in <a href="/doc/741918/" id="a_28">Tulshidas Kanolkar v. State of Goa</a>:
               "5. We shall first deal with the question of delay.
               The unusual circumstances satisfactorily explained
               the delay in lodging of the first information report.
               In any event, delay per se is not a mitigating
               circumstance for the accused when accusations of
               rape are involved. Delay in lodging the first
               information report cannot be used as a ritualistic
               formula for discarding the prosecution case and
               doubting its authenticity. It only puts the court on
               guard to search for and consider if any
               explanation has been offered for the delay. Once it
               is offered, the court is to only see whether it is




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">CRL.A 378/17                                                  Page 28 of 43</span>
                satisfactory or not. In case if the prosecution fails
               to satisfactorily explain the delay and there is
               possibility of embellishment or exaggeration in the
               prosecution version on account of such delay, it is
               a relevant factor. On the other hand, satisfactory
               explanation of the delay is weighty enough to reject
               the plea of false implication or vulnerability of the
               prosecution case. As the factual scenario shows,
               the victim was totally unaware of the catastrophe
               which had befallen her. That being so, the mere
               delay in lodging of the first information report does
               not in any way render the prosecution version
               brittle."

               "7...The submission overlooks the fact that in India
               women are slow and hesitant to complain of such
               assaults and if the prosecutrix happens to be a
               married person she will not do anything without
               informing her husband. Merely because the
               complaint was lodged less than promptly does not
               raise the inference that the complaint was false.
               The reluctance to go to the police is because of
               society's attitude towards such women; it casts
               doubt and shame upon her rather than comfort
               and sympathise with her. Therefore, delay in
               lodging complaints in such cases does not

               accepted the explanation for delay as satisfactory
               by giving detailed reasons, we are dismayed to find
               that the High Court has been swayed by this delay
               in reporting the matter with omnibus statement
               that it is not satisfactorily explained without even
               an iota of discussion on the explanation that was
               offered by the prosecution in the form of
               testimonies of PW-1 and PW-2."</blockquote>
<p id="p_36">       To similar effect is also the verdict of the Hon'ble Supreme in
"Satpal Singh Vs. State of Haryana" 2010 (7) SCALE 322 wherein,
it has been observed to the effect:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">               13. In a rape case the prosecutrix remains worried
               about her future. She remains in traumatic state of
               mind. The family of the victim generally shows
               reluctance to go to the police station because of
               society's attitude towards such a woman. It casts
               doubts and shame upon her rather than comfort
               and sympathise with her. Family remains concern
               about its honour and reputation of the prosecutrix.
               After only having a cool thought it is possible for
               the family to lodge a complaint in sexual offences.
               (Vide Karnel Singh Vs. State of M.P. AIR 1995 SC
               2472; and State of Punjab Vs. Gurmeet Singh &amp;
               Ors. AIR 1996 SC 1393).

<blockquote id="blockquote_22">               14. This Court has consistently highlighted the
               reasons, objects and means of prompt lodging of
               FIR. Delay in lodging FIR more often than not,
               results in embellishment and exaggeration, which
               is a creature of an afterthought. A delayed report
               not only gets bereft of the advantage of
               spontaneity, the danger of the introduction of a



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">CRL.A 378/17                                                 Page 30 of 43</span>
                coloured version, an exaggerated account of the
               incident or a concocted story as a result of
               deliberations and consultations, also creeps in,
               casting a serious doubt on its veracity. Thus, FIR is
               to be filed more promptly and if there is any delay,
               the prosecution must furnish a satisfactory
               explanation for the same for the reason that in
               case the substratum of the evidence given by the
               complainant/informant is found to be unreliable,
               the prosecution case has to be rejected in its
               entirety. [vide State of Andhra Pradesh Vs. M.
               Madhusudhan Rao (2008) 15 SCC 582].
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">               15. However, no straight jacket formula can be laid
               down in this regard. In case of sexual offences, the
               criteria may be different altogether. As honour of
               the family is involved, its members have to decide
               whether to take the matter to the court or not. In
               such a fact-situation, near relations of the
               prosecutrix may take time as to what course of
               action should be adopted. Thus, delay is bound to
               occur. This Court has always taken judicial notice
               of the fact that "ordinarily the family of the victim
               would not intend to get a stigma attached to the
               victim. Delay in lodging the First Information
               Report in a case of this nature is a normal
               phenomenon" [vide Satyapal Vs. State of Haryana

<blockquote id="blockquote_25">               "So far as the delay in lodging the FIR is

               offences. There are several factors which weigh in
               the mind of the prosecutrix and her family
               members before coming to the police station to

                lodge a complaint. In a tradition bound society
               prevalent in India, more particularly, rural areas,
               it would be quite unsafe to throw out the
               prosecution case merely on the ground that there is
               some delay in lodging the FIR."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">               17. Thus, in view of the above, the delay in lodging
               FIR in sexual offences has to be considered with a
               different yardstick.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">               18. If the instant case is examined in the light of
               the aforesaid settled legal proposition, we are of the
               considered opinion that the delay in lodging the
               FIR has been satisfactorily explained."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_37">33.    Thus, in the instant case the delay in registration of the FIR has
been satisfactorily explained even if the aunt (Y) of the prosecutrix (P)
learnt of the commission of rape on both dates i.e. 17.04.2014 &amp;
18.04.2014, taking into account the factum that she is the wife of the
accused/appellant herein, the delay of marginal number of days i.e. the
delay of 8 days approximately till the date 25.04.2014 is clearly
explained.
</p>
<p id="p_38">34.    As regards the contention raised on behalf of the appellant that
there are no injuries on the person of the prosecutrix (P), which itself
negated the factum of any commission of rape on the prosecutrix (P)
by the accused/appellant herein coupled with the factum that there was
no semen detected in the exhibits i.e. the clothes of the prosecutrix (P),
it is essential to observe that the medical examination of the
prosecutrix (P) was conducted only on 25.04.2014 with the
commission of rape on the prosecutrix (P) on 17.04.2014 &amp;
18.04.2014.       The MLC Ex.PW1/A indicates the existence of the

 hymen being torn and indicates that the prosecutrix (P) did state to the
doctor who had examined her that she had been sexually assaulted by
the accused/appellant twice and that he had threatened to kill her if she
told anyone of the same and the MLC also indicates that despite the
same the prosecutrix wanted to get herself examined, and it cannot
also be overlooked that the prosecutrix (P) in her testimony stated that
after the incidents of rape she had bathed, coupled with the factum that
in view of the FIR having been registered on 25.04.2014, the medical
examination of the prosecutrix on 25.04.2014 could thus not bring
forth the fresh injuries on her person and could have thus also not
assisted in bringing forth the existence of any semen on any of the
clothes that were worn by the prosecutrix (P) at the time of the
medical examination. Thus, the absence of any injury and the absence
of semen on the clothes of the prosecutrix (P) does not in any manner
suffice to detract the veracity of the testimony of the prosecutrix (P)
which in the facts and circumstances of the instant case does not
require any corroboration whatsoever. The verdict of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in "Radhu Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh"2007
CRL. L.J. 4704 categorically lays down to the effect:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_28">        5. It is now well settled that a finding of guilt in a case
        of rape, can be based on the uncorroborated evidence
        of the prosecutrix. The very nature of offence makes it
        difficult to get direct corroborating evidence. The
        evidence of the prosecutrix should not be rejected on
        the basis of minor discrepancies and contradictions. If
        the victim of rape states on oath that she was forcibly
        subjected to sexual intercourse, her statement will
        normally be accepted, even if it is uncorroborated,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">CRL.A 378/17                                                 Page 33 of 43</span>
         unless the material on record requires drawing of an
        inference that there was consent or that the entire
        incident was improbable or imaginary. Even if there is
        consent, the act will still be a 'rape', if the girl is under
        16 years of age. It is also well settled that absence of
        injuries on the private parts of the victim will not by
        itself falsify the case of rape, nor construed as
        evidence of consent. Similarly, the opinion of a doctor
        that there was no evidence of any sexual intercourse
        or rape, may not be sufficient to disbelieve the
        accusation of rape by the victim. Bruises, abrasions
        and scratches on the victim especially on the
        forearms, writs, face, breast, thighs and back are
        indicative of struggle and will support the allegation
        of sexual assault. The courts should, at the same time,
        bear in mind that false charges of rape are not
        uncommon. There have also been rare instances
        where a parent has persuaded a gullible or obedient
        daughter to make a false charge of a rape either to
        take revenge or extort money or to get rid of financial
        liability. Whether there was rape or not would depend
        ultimately on the facts and circumstances of each
        case."
</blockquote><p id="p_39">35.    Undoubtedly, the testimony of the prosecutrix which is the sole
testimony to be considered has to be one which inspires confidence
and as observed hereinabove in the instant case, the available record
brings forth a consistency in relation to all material particulars qua the
commission of the offence. It has been laid down by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in "<a href="/doc/118746117/" id="a_31">Narinder Kumar V. State (NCT of Delhi</a>) in
Crl. Appeal Nos. 2066-67 of 2009 which observed to the effect:-

               based only on the solitary evidence of the

                prosecutrix and no corroboration would be
               required unless there are compelling reasons
               which necessitate the court for corroboration of
               her statement. Corroboration of testimony of the
               prosecutrix as a condition for judicial reliance is
               not a requirement of law but a guidance of
               prudence under the given facts and circumstances.
               Minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies
               should not be a ground for throwing out an
               otherwise reliable prosecution case. A prosecutrix
               complaining of having been a victim of the offence
               of rape is not an accomplice after the crime. Her
               testimony has to be appreciated on the principle of
               probabilities just as the testimony of any other
               witness; a high degree of probability having been
               shown to exist in view of the subject matter being a
               criminal charge. However, if the court finds it
               difficult to accept the version of the prosecutrix on
               its face value, it may search for evidence, direct or
               substantial, which may lend assurance to her
               testimony. (Vide: <a href="/doc/860754/" id="a_32">Vimal Suresh Kamble v.

 Vs. State of Assam (1998) 8 SCC 635, wherein it has been observed
to the effect:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">        8. The observations in Gurmit Singh's case were
        reiterated in <a href="/doc/905384/" id="a_35">Ranjit Hazarika vs. State of Assam</a>(1998)
        8 SCC 635 in the following terms: "The courts must,
        while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the fact that
        in a case of rape, no self-respecting woman would
        come forward in a court just to make a humiliating
        statement against her honour such as is involved in
        the commission of rape on her. In cases involving
        sexual molestation, supposed considerations which
        have no material effect on the veracity of the
        prosecution case or even discrepancies in the
        statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the
        discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be
        allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution
        case. The inherent bashfulness of the females and the
        tendency to conceal outrage of sexual aggression are
        factors which the courts should not overlook. The
        testimony of the victim in such cases is vital and
        unless there are compelling reasons which necessitate
        looking for corroboration of her statement, the courts
        should find no difficulty to act on the testimony of a
        victim of sexual assault alone to convict an accused
        where her testimony inspires confidence and is found
        to be reliable. Seeking corroboration of her statement
        before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases
        amounts to adding insult to injury. Why should the
        evidence of a girl or a woman who complains of rape
        or sexual molestation be viewed with doubt, disbelief
        or suspicion? The court while appreciating the
        evidence of a prosecutrix may look for some
        assurance of her statement to satisfy its judicial
        conscience, since she is a witness who is interested in
        the outcome of the charge leveled by her, but there is
        no requirement of law to insist upon corroboration of
        her statement to base conviction of an accused. The



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">CRL.A 378/17                                              Page 36 of 43</span>
         evidence of a victim of sexual assault stands almost on
        a par with the evidence of an injured witness and to
        an extent is even more reliable. Just as a witness who
        has sustained some injury in the occurrence, which is
        not found to be selfinflicted, is considered to be a good
        witness in the sense that he is least likely to shield the
        real culprit, the evidence of a victim of a sexual
        offence is entitled to great weight, absence of
        corroboration       notwithstanding.       Corroborative
        evidence is not an imperative component of judicial
        credence in every case of rape. Corroboration as a
        condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of the
        prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a guidance
        of prudence under given circumstances. It must not be
        overlooked that a woman or a girl subjected to sexual
        assault is not an accomplice to the crime but is a
        victim of another person's lust and it is improper and
        undesirable to test her evidence with a certain amount
        of suspicion, treating her as if she were an
        accomplice. Inferences have to be drawn from a given
        set of facts and circumstances with realistic diversity
        and not dead uniformity lest that type of rigidity in the
        shape of rule of law is introduced through a new form
        of testimonial tyranny making justice a casualty.
        Courts cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist
        upon corroboration even if, taken as a whole, the case
        spoken of by the victim of sex crime strikes the judicial
        mind as probable."

<p id="p_41">37.    The verdict of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in "Mohammad Ali
@ Guddu Vs. State of U.P."2015 Cr;.L.J. 1967 also lays down to
the effect:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">        "that the sole testimony of the prosecutrix if it is
        umimpeachable and beyond reproach can certainly
        result into a conviction and that the grammar of law
        permits the testimony of the prosecutrix to be accepted

         without any corroboration without material
        particulars, for she has to be placed on a higher
        pedestal than an injured witness, but, a pregnant one,
        when a Court on studied scrutiny of the evidence finds
        it difficult to accept the version of the prosecutrix,
        because it is not unreproachable, there is requirement
        for search of such direct or circumstantial evidence
        which would lend assurance to her testimony and
        where the testimony of the prosecutrix does not
        inspire confidence and the circumstantial evidence
        remotely do not lend support to the same, the
        conviction of the accused on the basis of the same will
        be erroneous."
