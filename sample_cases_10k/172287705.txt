<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     Page No. 2 of 9</span>


         keeping in view the request of the defendant, husband of the plaintiff
         advanced a loan of Rs. 4,00,000/- to the defendant by way of cheques.
         Defendant assured that the loan amount shall be refunded by 14.05.2012,
         in case the defendant failed to refund the loan amount within the period,
         then the husband of the plaintiff is entiled to recover the loan amount
         from the property bearing no. 2188, 2nd Floor,Bagichi Raghunath, Sadar
         Bazar, Delhi. That the defendant handed over the registered GPA of the
         abovesaid property as security to the husband of the plaintiff. That the
         husband of the plaintiff expired on 30.07.2011, thereafter, plaintiff
         requested the defendant several times to pay the loan amount alongwith
         interest. That the agreement executed was between the husband of the
         plaintiff and defendant on 15.06.2011 and the same got expired on
         14.05.2012. It is stated that the plaintiff issued a legal notice dated
         23.05.2012 upon the defendant demanding the loan amount and the same
         was received by the defendant. Despite the assurances and promises
         given by the defendant, the defendant failed to repay the loan amount and
         hence, the present suit has been filed the present suit for recovery of the
         said amount.      The present suit has been filed on the basis of loan
         agreement. It is stated that the cause of action arose in favour of the
         plaintiff and against the defendant on 15.06.2011 when the agreement
         was executed and the loan was advanced to the defendant. It further
         arose on 15.05.2012 when the time for repayment of loan got expired. It
         further arose when the plaintiff sent legal demand notice dated
         23.05.2012 sent to the defendant. Hence, the plaintiff has prayed that a
         decree for a sum of RS. 4,00,000/- alongwith interest @ 24% per annum

         defendant took the preliminary objections as follows:
   (4)            That the suit is not maintainable in the eyes of law as the same
         is based on false and frivolous grounds and the same is liable to be
         dismissed . That there is no cause of action for filing of the present suit
         as the plaintiff is not the legally wedded wife of the deceased Balwan
         Singh. It is stated that Mr. Balwan Singh was married with Guddo who is
         still alive and Mr. Balwan Singh had not obtained any divorce decree
         from any competent court of law and hence, Smt. Guddo is the legally
         wedded wife of Mr. Balwan Singh. It is stated that Mr. Balwan Singh
         died leaving behind his wife Smt. Guddo and three children namely
         Manoj Kumar, Amit Kumar and one daughter Ms. Sapna. That above
         said children were born out of the marriage of Balwan Singh and Smt.
         Guddo and plaintiff has no relation with Mr. Balwan Singh or his
         children. That the plaitiff has forged and fabricated the election I card
         and ration card just to cheat the public and to mis-represent the court.
         That the plaintiff has filed photocopy of ration card which shows that late
         Balwan Singh had two sons and 1 daughter and his assets are inherited
         by his class-1 legal heris in absence of any Will. Since there is no Will
         executed by Mr. Balwan Singh in favour of the plaintiff or other person,
         hence the suit is not maintainable.
</p><p id="p_3">         Reply on merits:

       free hold     built up property no., 2188, Ward No. XIV, at Bagichi

       of the said property. That the defendant agreed to sell the property to Mr.
       Balwan Singh for a sum of Rs. 22 Lacs, out of which Rs. 2 Las were
       paid through cheque and the remaining amount was to be paid to the
       defendant on or before 14.09.2011 within three months from the date of
       the deal. It is stated that no written agreement for sale and purchase was
       executed between Balwan singh and Defendant as they were known to
       each other. It is stated that at the request of Mr. Balwan Singh, defendant
       handed over the title documents to him for verification and for taking
       loan against the said property. It is stated that Mr. Balwan Singh expired
       on 30.07.2011 before completing the deal and before handing over the
       original documents to the defendant.         That plaintiff found out those
       documents and started blackmailing the defendant. That the defendant
       told the entire facts of the deal to the plaintiff but the plaintiff demaned
       double of the earnest money i.e. Rs. 4,00,000/- from the defendant. It is
       stated that the defendant told the plaintiff to make the payment of
       remaining amount of Rs. 20 Lacs on or before 14.09.2011 otherwise the
       earnest money already paid shall be forfeited.          That the defendant
       requested the plaintiff to make the remaining payment or to hand over the
       original documents to him. However, the plaintiff has neither made the
       payment nor returned the documents. It is stated that the loan agreement
       is forged and fabricated and has never been signed by the defendant.
       Para no. 3 of the plaint has also been denied. It is denied that if the
       defendant failed to refund the loan amount then the same could be
       recovered from the defendant's aforesaid property. It is denied that the
       original title documents were handed over by the defendant to Mr.
       Balwan Singh as security. It is stated that the defendant never executed
       and signed the alleged agreement. It is denied that the defendant had

         given number of assurances and made promises to repay the amount. It
         is also denied that the defendant is liable to pay interest @ 24% p.a. on
         the alleged loan amount. Hence, it is prayed that the plaint of the plaintif
         be dismissed with heavy cost in favour of the defendant.
   (6)              Replication to the written sttement was filed by the plaintiff
         wherein the plaintiff has denied the preliminary objections. It is stated

</p><p id="p_13">         7. Original loan agreement dated 15.06.2011 Ex. PW1/10
                  The exhibition of the document Ex.PW1/1, PW1/3, PW1/6,
         PW1/8 and PW1/9 were objected to as they were produced as new
         documents not having been placed on record and neither their copies
         having been supplied in advance.         The court observed that these
         objections shall be decided during the final arguments.
   (9)            During her examination in chief the plaintiff has stated that she
         does not want to file affidavit . She further deposed that Mr. Balwan
         Singh has taken a loan from my husband of Rs. 4 Lac on 15.06.2011 in
         her presence and Uma and Kamlesh were also present at that time. She
         further deposed that the defendant has not paid the amount till date. The
         amount was paid through cheque. At this stage, I shall decide the
         objections made by counsel for defendant to the exhibition of the
         documents Ex. PW1/1, PW1/3, PW1/6,PW1/8 and PW1/9. The stage for
         filing of documents in a civil suit is at or before settlement of issues.
         Order 13 rule 1 CPC says that the parties shall produce on or before
         settlement of issues all the documentary evidence in original, copies of
         which have been filed alongwith the plaint or written statement.
         Admittedly, these documents were filed and produced for the first time


CS No. 559/16 (10789/16)                             Premlata VS Raj Kumar Thakur
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   Page No. 7 of 9</span>


       only on 20.01.2016 much beyond the stage of settlement of issues
       without any explanation as to why they could not be produced earlier.
       Therefore, since there is no explanation and no leave of the court was
       sought nor any application filed in this regard, therefore, these
       documents cannot be admitted and read into evidence at this stage.
       Therefore, the objection raised by the counsel for defendant is sustained.
   (10)               During cross examination plaintiff/PW1 deposed that
       Guddi, the wife of Late Sh. Balwan Singh is still alive and there are four
       children out the wedlock of Mr. Balwan Singh and Guddi. That Late Sh.
       Balwan Singh had never disowned his children at any point of time. That
       there are no divorce proceedings between Guddi and Balwan Singh and
       she continues to be the wife of late Sh. Balwan Singh. She deposed that
       Smt. Guddi has not given any authority to her to file the present suit. She
       deposed that it is wrong to suggest that the transaction between Mr.
       Balwan singh and Raj Kumar did not take place in her presence. But still
       none of the documents relating to the alleged present transactions bears
       her signatures. She deposed that it is wrong to suggest that the alleged
       loan agreement 15.06.2011 Ex. PW1/10 is forged and fabricated by her.
       In the very next line she deposed that it is wrong to suggest that Sh.
       Balwan Singh made the payment of RS. 1.75 Lacs and Rs. 2 lacs by way
       of cheque and Rs. 25,000/- in cash to the defendant. She deposed that
       she is not aware of any transaction between late sh. Balwan Singh and
       defendant for purchase of property bearing no. 2188, Bagichi Raghunath,
       Second Floor, Sadar Bazar, Delhi. She also depsoed that it is also correct
       that she is not legally married to late Sh. Balwan Singh. Now I shall

</p><p id="p_20">       1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled for recovery of Rs. 4,00,000/-? OPP
   (13)             This is a suit for recovery of money.       It is alleged by the
       plaintiff that she is a wife of late Sh. Balwan Singh. It is alleged that late
       Sh. Balwan singh gave a friendly loan to the defendant and that late Sh.
       Balwan Singh has expired and that the defendant has not returned the
       loan either to late Sh. Balwan Singh before his death and has also refused
       to return the same to the plaintiff. Plaintiff has already admitted that
       Smt. Guddi is the legally wedded wife of late Sh. Balwan Singh and that
       no divorce ever took place between late Sh. Balwan Singh and Smt.
       Guddi. Plaintiff also deposed that there were four children out of the
       wedlock of late Sh. Balwan Singh and Smt. Guddi and they were never
       divorced at any point of time. Therefore, even as per the own admissions
       and evidence of plaintiff/PW1, she never became the legally wedded
       wife of late Sh. Balwan Singh and even if the factum of allegation of a
       loan having been given to the defendant by late Sh. Balwan Singh is to
