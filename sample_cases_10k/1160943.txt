</p>

<p id="p_5">Rajesh Bindal J.
</p><p id="p_6">                This order shall dispose of a bunch of 7 appeals bearing R.F.A. Nos.
1978, 794, 795, 796, 1584, 1585 and 1586 of 1998, as the same arise out of
common acquisition. However, the facts have been extracted from R.F.A. No.
1978 of 1998.
</p><p id="p_7">                The land owners are in appeal before this Court against the award of
the learned Court below seeking further enhancement of the compensation for the
acquired land.
</p><p id="p_8">                Briefly, the facts are that vide notification dated 27.12.1988, issued
under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_2">Section 4</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, `the Act'), State of
Punjab acquired 21 acres, 4 kanals and 9 marlas of land at Boha Town for the
establishment of New Anaj Mandi. The same was followed by notification dated
8.6.1989 issued under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_3">Section 6</a> of the Act. The Land Acquisition Collector (for
short, `the Collector') vide his award dated 8.10.1990, determined the market value
at Rs. 30,000/- per acre for nehri land; Rs. 15,000/- per acre for barani land and Rs.
15,000/- per acre for gair mumkin kind of land. Aggrieved against the same, the
appellants filed objections, which were referred to learned Additional District
Judge, Mansa, who keeping in view the material placed before him by the parties,
awarded Rs. 38,000/- per acre for nehri land, Rs. 18,000/- per acre for barani land
and Rs.17,000/- per acre for gair mumkin land as compensation.
</p><p id="p_9"> R.F.A. No. 1978 of 1998                                     [Page numbers]

                Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
                Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the evidence
produced by them in the form of six sale deeds, out of which three pertained to the
acquired land, have not been given due weight by the learned Court below while
assessing the value of the acquired land. Relying upon the judgments of this Court
in Harchal Singh v. The State of Punjab, 1991(1) RRR 353; <a href="/doc/1860378/" id="a_4">Kehar Singh v.
Punjab State</a>, 1992(1) RRR 81; Harjit Singh @ Kaka Singh (died) v. State of
Punjab and another, 2004(1) RCR (Civil) 484 and <a href="/doc/99108/" id="a_5">The Jalandhar Improvement
Trust, Jalandhar v. Smt. Vidya Suri and others</a>, 2006(1) RCR (Civil) 631, it was
submitted that the land in question had urban potential as it is situated quite close
to the abadi area, where the land in the vicinity had already been developed. The
categorisation of the the land in chahi and barani was not proper and the entire
land should have been assessed at the same rate. Further the submission is that the
best piece of evidence is in the form of sale deeds (Ex.A.29, Ex. A.30 and Ex.
A.31), which is part of the acquired land. Even if it is considered that these
transactions were for a small piece of land, a reasonable cut could be applied.
Another fact which requires consideration is that these sale transactions are dated
17.12.1985, whereas the land in question was acquired vide notification dated
27.12.1988. Summing up the arguments, it is further contended that the learned
court below has not even discussed the evidence led by the appellants as it had
made a vague assessment after merely referring to the evidence led by the parties.
</p><p id="p_10">                On the other hand, learned counsel for the State submitted that the
land in question was acquired for setting up of a grain market for which the
amount of compensation is to be paid by the Punjab State Agricultural Marketing
Board (for short, `the Board') and it is the Board only which is the contesting
party.
</p><p id="p_11">                A perusal of the impugned award shows that the land owners
produced in evidence six sale deeds (Ex. A.28 to Ex. A.33). Sale deed (Ex. A.33)
is dated 12.5.1995, i.e., nearly seven years after the acquisition. Accordingly, the
consideration thereof is totally ruled out.
</p><p id="p_12">                There are three sale deeds (Ex. A.29, Ex. A.30 and Ex. A.31) which
form part of the acquired land. The sale deeds are dated 17.12.1985, whereas the
land in question was acquired on 27.12.1988. The area forming part of these sale
deeds is 3-1/3 marlas each. Average compensation paid therein is Rs. 1,12,000/-
per acre, as is noticed by the learned Court below in the impugned award. It is an
admitted fact on record that the land is situated close to city which had great
potential for urbanisation and in fact, the pressure for that purpose was on the land
 R.F.A. No. 1978 of 1998                                      [Page numbers]

in question and the other land situated in the vicinity. Thickly populated abadi area
was not far off. The land is situated on main Ratia-Budhladha road. The
transactions forming part of sale deeds Ex. A29, Ex. A30 and Ex. A31 had taken
place on 17.12.1985, whereas the land was acquired more than three years
thereafter, i.e., on 27.12.1988. For this period of three years gap, an increase of
25% can very well be granted. Accordingly, adding another sum of Rs. 29,000/-
therein, the value of the sale transactions forming part of Ex. A29, Ex. A30 and
Ex. A31 would come out to Rs. 1,41,000/- per acre.
</p><p id="p_13">                Now the issue is as to whether this should be taken as the fair value
of the acquired land or a reasonable cut is to be applied considering the fact that
the transactions were for a very small piece of land, namely, 3x3-1/2 marls each,
which were purchased for commercial purposes and located on the main road.
Accordingly, in my considered view, a cut of 65% would be reasonable and
reducing a sum of Rs. 91,000/- on that account, the value of the acquired land is
determined at Rs. 50,000/- per acre, but this value cannot be for the entire chunk of
land for the simple reason that the value on the main road is always higher as
compared to the value of the land behind it. Even the sale transactions, referred to
above and relied upon, are also forming part of the land situated on the main road.
The value so determined above shall be for the land upto the depth of 100 meters
from the main road which shall form group `A' and for the rest of the land, the
value shall be 10% less than the value determined for the front portion, namely,
Rs. 45,000/- per acre. The categorisation of the land into Chahi, Barani and Gair
Mumkin is being done away with for the simple reason that it is a land which is
quite close to the urbanised area and had great potential for urbanisation and as
such could not be considered as an agricultural land. The land owners shall also be
entitled to all the statutory benefits available to them under the Act.
</p><p id="p_14">                Accordingly, the appeals are allowed.
