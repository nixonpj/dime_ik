                 --------------------------------------
             Dated this the 7th day of November, 2019

                            ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">            The petitioner herein has been arrayed as accused

No.2 among the two accused in the instant Crime No.1287/2017 of

Pooyapally Police Station, which has been registered for offences

punishable under Secs.363, 376, 377 &amp; 34 of the IPC and Secs.3(a)

r/w 16 r/w 17 of the POCSO Act, 2012, on the basis of FIS given by

the defacto complainant/first informant on 4.8.2017 in respect of

the alleged incident which has happened on 4.4.2017 at about

11.30 am.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.     There are two accused persons in this case and two

minor victim girls. The allegations in this case as made out in the

FIS given by the one of the minor victim girl is that, the first

informant minor victim girl aged 17 years and another minor

victim girl aged 14 years had gone along with both the accused

persons to a hotel on 4.4.2017 at about 11.30 am and there A1 had

sexual intercourse with the first informant minor victim girl, and

A2 had sexual intercourse with the second victim girl, and thereby

the accused persons have committed the abovesaid offences.
 B.A. No. 7908 of 2019
                                  ..3..
</p>
<p id="p_3">

It appears that A1 was arrested in this case on 5.8.2017 and thereafter

remanded and later let out on regular bail as per Anx.A1 order dated

30.8.2017 rendered by this Court in B.A. No. 6185/2017 filed by the

said accused No.1. Further, according to the prosecution the

petitioner herein (A2) could not be apprehended as he gone abroad

and he returned back only recently and has been arrested on

5.10.2019 and after his remand has been under detention since then.

</p><p id="p_4">      3.     The counsel for the petitioner would urge that the

abovesaid allegations are all false and baseless and that alleged

incidents are said to have happened as early as on 4.4.2017, whereas

the FIS and Crime has been lodged as late as on 4.8.2017 and that the

prosecution has not given any explanation for the long delay in this

regard and the long and unexplained delay would vitiate the entire

criminal proceedings and would raise serious suspicions about the

very believability and credibility of the prosecution story. Further

that, there are no allegations made anywhere in the prosecution case,

even remotely suggesting that the any of the accused persons have

committed       the offence of Sec.377 of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a> (deals with carnal

intercourse against the order of nature). Further it is stated that, the

petitioner is a young man aged 28 years and that since he has suffered
 B.A. No. 7908 of 2019
                                   ..4..
</p>
<p id="p_5">

detention since 8.10.2019, his further detention may not be necessary

more particularly accused No.1 was released on regular bail on

completion of 25 days of remand.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      4.     The learned Prosecutor has opposed the plea for regular

bail and has pointed out that there is every possibility that the

petitioner intimidating and influencing both the minor victim girls, if

he is let out on bail. Further, the petitioner could not be arrested for a

very long period as he had gone abroad and there is every possibility

that the petitioner abscondoning, etc.

</p><p id="p_7">      5.     After hearing both sides and after careful evaluation of the

facts and circumstances of the case and taking note of the fact that A1

in the very same crime was released on regular bail on completion of

about 25 days after his remand as can be seen from Anx.A1 order, and

also taking into account that the petitioner       has already suffered

detention since 8.10.2019, this Court is inclined to take the view that

his further incarceration could be avoided and he could be ordered to

be released on regular bail subject to stringent conditions. However,

taking note of the abovesaid serious apprehension raised by the

prosecution, it is proposed to order as a safeguard that the petitioner

shall not enter into or reside anywhere within the territorial limits of
 B.A. No. 7908 of 2019
                                         ..5..
</p>
<p id="p_8">

the Police Station where both the minor victim girls are residing or

studying until the conclusion of trial process, subject to certain

exceptions which will be dealt with hereinafter. Further that, the

petitioner shall surrender his Passport before the Special Court

concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      6.       Accordingly it is ordered that the petitioner shall be

released on bail on his executing bond for Rs.40,000/- and on his

furnishing two solvent sureties for the like sum, both to the

satisfaction of the competent court below concerned. However the

grant of bail will be subject to the following conditions:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       i.     The petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer
       (I.O.) on every 2nd and 4th Saturdays, at any time between 9 am and
       1 pm, for the next 6 months, and thereafter he will report before the
       I.O., as and when directed.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       ii.    The petitioner shall not intimidate or attempt to influence the
       victim, witnesses; nor shall he tamper with the evidence.

       institution or residence of both the minor victim girls.</blockquote><p id="p_10">


</p><p id="p_11">       v.     The petitioner shall not enter into or reside anywhere within
       the territorial limits of the Police Station where both the minor

<p id="p_12">

       victim girls are residing or studying until the conclusion of trial
       process in this case, except for the limited purpose of reporting
       before the Investigating Officer concerned in this crime, or for
       attending to the Court in relation to this case or any other cases or
       for contacting his lawyers/advocates concerned.


       vi.   However if on account of any emergent personal need the
       petitioner wants to visit the said area, he may do so but only with
       the prior permission of the Investigating Officer concerned.


       vii. The petitioner will immediately surrender his Passport before
       the Special Court concerned notified to deal with POCSO Cases,
       Kollam, immediately on his release at any rate within one week
       there from.
</p>
<p id="p_13">              If there is any violation of the abovesaid conditions by the

petitioner then the jurisdictional court concerned will stand hereby

empowered to consider the plea for cancellation of bail if required,

and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law.

</p><p id="p_14">              With these observations and directions, the above Bail

Application will stand disposed of.
