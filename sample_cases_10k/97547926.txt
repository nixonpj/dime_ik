                 CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHUTOSH KUMAR
                                       ORAL ORDER

9   21-02-2019                 These batch of cases, which have been filed by
                   the unsuccessful candidates who had applied for being
                   appointed as Constable-cum-Driver, have been heard
                   today.
</p><p id="p_3"> Patna High Court CWJC No.13823 of 2017(9) dt.21-02-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                           7/9</span>




                      Several instances of irregularities have been
          pointed out, especially one case, where one of the
          recommendees of the Commission, while had gone to
          give his joining was found not to possess even the basic
          trait of driving. A FIR had to be registered as it was
          found that the person had impersonated or was wrongly
          appointed.
</p><p id="p_4">                      The matter is still under investigation.
                      The other aspect which was pointed out by the
          learned counsel appearing for the parties, in unison, is
          that when the list was recommended, one of the
          members of the Board did not sign the list for the reason
          that he wanted to personally verify the marking of the
          candidates on the OMR sheets and the marks given to
          them in the merit list. This has raised suspicion in the
          mind of unsuccessful candidates, some of whom are the
          petitioners here, that the particular member of the board
          smelt rat.
</p><p id="p_5">                      Learned counsel for the petitioners have also
          pointed out that the cut off marks in each category has
          not been published and even the list of unsuccessful
          candidates has not been published. Though it may not be
          necessary for the Commission to indicate the marks
          obtained by the successful candidates; nonetheless, the
          cut off marks in each category has to be made known for
 Patna High Court CWJC No.13823 of 2017(9) dt.21-02-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                           8/9</span>




          showing the bonafides/fairness in the preparation of the
          result which was published, especially in view of serious
          objections raised by some of the candidates.
</p><p id="p_6">                      This Court finds that on an earlier occasion, the
          bench hearing the matter on 04.12.2018 had directed
          for the entire OMR sheets of the successful candidates
          to be produced before this Court.
</p><p id="p_7">                      Mr. P.N. Shahi, learned AAG-4 who represents
          the Commission has informed this Court that all the
          OMR sheets have been collected together and have been
          kept in three receptacles which can be brought before
          this Court any time that the Court desires. In fact, it has
          also been stated that the receptacles in which the OMR
          sheets have been kept can be deposited in the custody
          of the High Court for it to be opened any time that it is
          required.
</p><p id="p_8">                      So far for the inspection of OMR sheets.
                      This Court further directs the respondent
          Commission to collect information from the different
          district headquarters where the selected/successful
          candidates have been sent for joining and seek
          information whether any case has been registered
          against such persons who were found to be imposters or
          who did not have the requisite trait of driving but have
          been recommended by the Commission. All such

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                       9/9</span>




                      names/instances/FIRs registered, if any, shall be collated
                      in one list and shall be produced for the inspection of
                      this Court on the next date.
</p><p id="p_9">                                  This Court further makes it clear that if the list
                      of such aberration is not substantial, it would be difficult
                      for this Court to accept the proposition that there was a
                      wide scale irregularity. On the converse, if the number is
                      large which is inexplicable, the Court would have every
                      occasion to view the merit list with suspicion.
</p><p id="p_10">                                  Let the aforesaid two directions be carried out
                      by the Commission by the next date. It would be open
                      for the counsel for the petitioners to bring any further
                      evidence in support of their claim that the entire process
                      was marred by irregularities, in the meanwhile.
