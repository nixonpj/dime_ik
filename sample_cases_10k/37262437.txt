         (SMT.SANGITA CHOURASIA &amp; ORS Vs THE STATE OF M.P. AND ORS.)


18-06-2015

      Shri Vijay Shukla, learned counsel for the petitioners.
      Shri A.P. Singh, learned Govt. Adv. for the State.
      Heard.
      The petitioners have filed this petition against the order
dated 27.2.2003 (Annexure-P-2) passed by the Collector and order
dated 7.1.2005 (Annexure-P-6) passed the Commissioner.
      The petitioners were appointed on the post of Contract
Teachers Class-II and Class-III in pursuance to the advertisement
issued by the competent Authority. Subsequent to appointment of
the petitioners, the respondent No.6 questioned the selection of</pre>
<p id="p_1">Contract Teachers in an appeal filed before the Collector. The
Collector vide impugned order dated 27.2.2003 held that there
were certain irregularities in the selection process and ultimately
set aside the whole selection of Contract Teachers Class-II and
Class-III undertaken by the Gram Panchayat Baldevgarh. Against
the aforesaid order, the petitioners preferred an revision before the
Commissioner and contended that they were not made party in the
appeal preferred by the respondent no.6 before the Collector.
Neither they were given opportunity of hearing by the Collector
before cancellation of the select list and the order was passed
hence, the order passed by the Collector is in violation of rule of
natural justice.
</p><p id="p_2">      The Commissioner, dismissed the revision vide impugned
order dated 7.1.2005 after holding that it was obligatory on the
part of the petitioners to file an application before the Collector so
 they could be added as party. The Commissioner further observed
that there were apparent irregularities in the process of selection
and the Collector has considered the record of the case. The
Collector cancelled the selection. In such circumstances, the order
passed by the Collector is in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_3">      The question for consideration before this Court is whether
the order passed by the Collector without giving any opportunity of
hearing to the petitioners is in accordance with law. It is an
admitted fact that the petitioners were given appointment in
pursuance to the process of selection initiated by the Janpad
Panchayat on the post of Contract Teachers Class-II and Class-III.
The petitioners were not made party by the respondent No.6 in the
appeal filed before the Collector. The Collector had also not given
any opportunity of hearing at the time of cancellation of selection
process. In consequence of cancellation of selection process, the
appointment of the petitioners were also cancelled. This is not a
case where the selection process was cancelled before
appointment. The Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/198387/" id="a_1">Aligarh Muslim
University and others vs. Mansoor Ali Khan</a> reported in (2000)
7 SCC 529 has relaxed the rule of natural justice in certain
circumstances.
</p><p id="p_4">      In the present case, the Collector has found certain
irregularities in the selection process. The petitioners who were
selected and appointed were entitled hearing before cancellation of
their appointments. It was obligatory on the part of the respondent
no.6 to make the petitioners as necessary party in the appeal. In
my opinion, the appeal filed by the respondent no.6 before the
Collector was not maintainable in absence of necessary
 parties/respondents. The Commissioner could have remitted back
the matter to the Collector for passing fresh order after giving
opportunity of hearing to the petitioners. If the order passed by the
Collector is permitted to stand, then it would amount that the
services of the petitioners be terminated without giving any
opportunity of hearing.
</p><p id="p_5">Learned counsel for the petitioners has contended that in
pursuance to the stay order passed by this Court, the petitioners
are in service and some of the petitioners have also been
regularized.
</p><p id="p_6">In this view of the matter, in my opinion, the order passed by the
Collector is contrary to law and is in violation of rule of natural
justice. Consequently, the petition is disposed of with the following
directions:
</p><p id="p_7">(1) The impugned orders passed by the Collector and
Commissioner (Annexure-P-2) and (Annexure-P-6) respectively are
hereby set aside. The matter is remitted back to the Collector
Tikamgarh to pass fresh order after giving opportunity of hearing to
all the affected parties.
</p><p id="p_8">Looking to the long pendency of the case, it is desirable that the
Collector may decide the controversy preferably within a period of
six months from the date of receipt of the copy of the order.
It is made clear that this Court has not opined about the merit of
the matter.
</p><p id="p_9">Petition is disposed of as indicated above. No order as to the costs.
Certified copy as per rules.
</p>
