(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE PRAKASH CHANDRA JAISWAL)
Date:   28-07-2017


                     Heard learned counsel for the appellant as well as

   learned APP for the State.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                  2. This appeal has been preferred against the judgment

   and order of conviction and sentence dated 12.01.2012 passed by the

   learned Additional Sessions Judge-III, Saran at Chapra in Sessions

   Trial No. 351 of 2011 arising out of Daudpur P.S. Case No. 64 of

   2010, whereby convicting the appellant for the offence punishable

   under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">Section 302</a> of the Indian Penal Code and sentencing him to
 Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.134 of 2012 dt.28-07-2017

        undergo life imprisonment and also slapping him with fine of

        Rs.15,000/- and in default of payment of fine to further undergo R.I.

        for one year.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                          3. The factual matrix of the case is that Daudpur P.S.

        Case No. 64 of 2010 was instituted under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">34</a> of the

        Indian Penal Code against the appellant, namely, Raghunath Thakur

        and one unknown accused on the basis of written report of the

        informant Santosh Barnwal, son of Sri Brij Mohan Prasad Barnwal,

        with the allegation in succinct that, his brother, namely, Shailendar

        Kumar Barnwal used to collect R.D. amount daily in the area. On

        09.07.2010 in the evening, he had gone for the said collection in

        village Jaitpur Tiwari Tola. While the informant was proceeding via

        Tiwari Tola on an invitation, he abruptly heard alarm of 'save-save'

        in the said area. He witnessed two persons, namely, Raghunath

        Thakur and one unknown miscreant assaulting his brother by means

        of Bhujali. He rushed to his brother, but his brother had died

        sustaining injury by that time. After committing murder, the accused

        persons left the scene. The bone of contention is previous animosity.

</p><p id="p_8">                          4. The aforesaid case was investigated by the Police.

        During the course of investigation, the I.O. recorded further

        statement of the informant, statement of the witnesses, inspected the

        place of occurrence and prepared inquest report and sent the dead

        body for autopsy and filed the chargesheet against the appellant
 Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.134 of 2012 dt.28-07-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         3/13</span>




        under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_4">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_5">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                          5. On the basis of the chargesheet and the case diary,

        the learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_6">Sections

        302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_7">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code and committed the case to the Court

        of Sessions for its trial. Charge against the appellant was framed

        under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_8">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_9">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code to which he pleaded

        not guilty and claimed to be tried.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                          6. During the course of trial, in ocular evidence, the

        prosecution has been able to adduce altogether nine prosecution

        witnesses namely, Omprakash Barnwal (PW-1), Sunil Kumar

        Barnwal (PW-2), Ramnath Bhartiya (PW-3), Dr. Shambhunath Singh

        (PW-4), Santosh Barnwal (PW-5), Bikram Prasad (PW-6), Jay

        Prakash (PW-7), Md. Hussnain Khan (PW-8) and Arvind Kr. Pandey

        (PW-9). Out of the aforesaid witnesses, Ramnath Bhartiya (PW-3)

        and Bikram Prasad (PW-6) turned hostile while Arvind Kr. Pandey

        (PW-9) happens to be formal witness. In documentary evidence, the

        prosecution has filed and exhibited several documents.

</p><p id="p_11">                          7. The statement of the appellant was recorded under

        <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal procedure. The case of the

        defence is complete denial of the occurrence claiming to have been

        falsely implicated in this case. The appellant has not adduced either

        any ocular or documentary evidence in buttress of his case.

</p><p id="p_12">                        8. After hearing the parties and perusing the record, the
 Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.134 of 2012 dt.28-07-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         4/13</span>




        learned lower court convicted the appellant for the offence punishable

        under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_11">Section 302</a> of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to

        undergo life imprisonment and also slapped him with fine of

        Rs.15,000/- and in default of payment of fine to further undergo R.I.

        for one year.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                          9. The point for consideration in this case is, as to

        whether the prosecution has been able to bring home the charge

        levelled against the appellant beyond all reasonable doubts or not.

</p><p id="p_14">                          10. It is submitted by learned counsel for the appellant

        that the witnesses examined by the prosecution are interested

        witnesses in this case and the statement of the aforesaid witnesses are

        full of contradiction, so the same cannot be relied upon for

        conviction of the appellant. It is further submitted by learned counsel

        for the appellant that the ocular evidence has also not been

        corroborated by the medical evidence. One of the F.I.R. named

        witness, namely, Rajesh Singh has not been examined by the

        prosecution rather withheld by it and no explanation has been

        assigned by the prosecution for his non-examination which goes to

        create serious doubt about the prosecution case. It is further

        submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant that the occurrence

        is said to have taken place at 06:30 P.M. and the police is said to

        have arrived at the place of occurrence on giving information by

        some other person at 06:45 P.M and a written report was furnished
 Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.134 of 2012 dt.28-07-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                         5/13</span>




        by the informant to him which indicates that the occurrence had not

        taken place at the aforesaid time rather preceding to that and a

        written report prepared earlier was handed over to the police by the

        informant on its arrival which creates serious doubt about the sanctity

        and veracity of the said written report. PW-2, namely, Sunil Kumar

        Barnwal is not the eye witness of the occurrence and his statement

        was not recorded by the police under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_12">Section 161</a> of the Code of

        Criminal Procedure. Hence, the statement of the aforesaid witness

        cannot be relied upon for conviction of the appellant. Barring the

        interested witness, no other witness of the vicinity of the place of

        occurrence has been examined by the prosecution. PW-9, namely,

        Arvind Kumar Pandey was also not examined by the I.O. under

        <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_13">Section 161</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure. So his statement has

        also no credence. It is also submitted by learned counsel for the

        appellant that the occurrence took place on 09.07.2010 and F.I.R.

        was lodged on 10.07.2010 at 04 A.M., but the same was sent to the

        court concerned on 11.07.2010 which creates serious doubt about the

        prosecution case, as there was sufficient time for manipulation of the

        case after deliberation.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                          11. On the other hand, it is submitted by learned APP

        that though PW-2 Sunil Kumar Barnwal does not happen to be the

        eye witness of the occurrence, but the informant (PW-5) and his

        companion (PW-1) have supported the occurrence as alleged in the
 Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.134 of 2012 dt.28-07-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                         6/13</span>




        F.I.R. in toto. Albeit they happen to be the interested witnesses of the

        case, but their statements are consistent inter se and with the

        prosecution case and nothing cogent and convincing has been elicited

        in their cross examination by the defence to rule out their testimony.

        The aforesaid ocular evidences of the prosecution also stand

        corroborated by medical evidence. The Investigating Officer of this

        case has also been examined by the prosecution who has proved the

        place of occurrence and recording of the statement of the witnesses.

        Thus prosecution has successfully substantiated the charge under

        <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_14">Section 302</a> of the Indian Penal Code levelled against the appellant

        beyond all reasonable doubts and the learned lower court has passed

        the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence

        correctly appreciating the evidence, facts and law involved in the

        case which is liable to be sustained and this appeal is liable to be

        dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                          12. From perusal of the testimony of PW-1, namely,

        Om Prakash Barnwal who happens to be the cousin brother of the

        informant, it appears that the said witness happens to be the eye

        witness of the occurrence. He is also F.I.R. named witness and the

        companion of the informant at the time of occurrence. In Para-1 and

        Para-2 of his examination-in-chief, he has stated that when he arrived

        near Jaitpur Tiwari Tola, he heard the alarm of 'save-save'.

        Responding to halla, Santosh Barnwal rushed to the place of halla
 Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.134 of 2012 dt.28-07-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                         7/13</span>




        and he followed him on motorcycle. The said alarm of 'save-save'

        was of Shailendra Kumar Barnwal. He witnessed the appellant,

        namely, Raghunath Thakur and one unknown miscreant assaulting

        Shailendra Kumar Barnwal indiscriminately by means of Bhujali.

        Sustaining Bhujali injury on his neck, he fell dead. He had sustained

        4-5 more injuries at other places, on ear and head. In Para-12 of his

        cross examination, he has further stated that Santosh Barnwal was

        with him when they arrived at the place of occurrence. Both the

        accused were present there. On his arrival at the place of occurrence,

        accused escaped assaulting on the neck of the deceased.

</p><p id="p_17">                          13. The informant Santosh Barnwal (PW-5) also

        happens to be the eye witness of the occurrence and he appears to

        have supported the occurrence in toto. In Para-1, 2, 3 and 4 of his

        examination-in-chief, he has stated that on the date and time of

        occurrence, he was proceeding via said passage on an invitation to

        Jaitpur Tiwari Tola. On listening alarm of 'save-save', he went there

        and witnessed Raghunath Thakur and one unknown miscreant

        assaulting his brother indiscriminately by means of Bhujali. When he

        arrived close to the aforesaid place, Raghunath Thakur escaped

        assaulting on the neck of his brother by means of Bhujali. Sustaining

        injury, his brother died. In Para-8 of his cross-examination, he has

        further stated that he and Om Prakash Barnwal (PW-1) had arrived at

        the place of occurrence at first. At the time of his arrival there,
 Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.134 of 2012 dt.28-07-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                         8/13</span>




        accused persons had not escaped rather were assaulting the deceased.

</p><p id="p_18">                          14. From the aforesaid testimony of PW-1 and PW-5, it

        appears that both the aforesaid witnesses have claimed each other to

        their companion to the place of occurrence and corroborated their

        presence at the place of the occurrence at the time of occurrence and

        witnessing the occurrence by them. Nothing convincing and cogent

        has been elicited by the defence in the cross-examination of the

        aforesaid witnesses having potential to rule out their presence at the

        place of occurrence at the time of occurrence and witnessing the

        occurrence by them.
</p>
<p id="p_19">                          15. Albeit, PW-2 Sunil Kumar Barnwal who happens

        to be the own brother of the informant, in his examination-in-chief,

        has claimed himself to be the eye witness of the occurrence and

        witnessed the occurrence of assaulting the deceased by the appellant

        and one unknown miscreant by means of Bhujali. But the informant

        has ruled him out to be the eye witness of the occurrence by stating

        in Para-9 of his cross examination that Sunil Kumar Barnwal and

        Ramnath Bhartiya had arrived at the place of occurrence responding

        halla made by them.
</p>
<p id="p_20">                          16. I.O., Jay Prakash (PW-7) of this case has also stated

        in Para-12 of his examination-in-chief that Sunil Kuamr Barnwal had

        divulged him that when he arrived at the place of occurrence, the

        dead body of the deceased Shailendra Kumar Barnwal was lying
 Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.134 of 2012 dt.28-07-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                         9/13</span>




        there. The aforesaid statement of the informant and the I.O. candidly

        indicates that PW-2 Sunil Kumar Barnwal had arrived at the place of

        occurrence responding halla made by the informant and Om Prakash

        Barnwal and witnessed Shailendra Kumar Barnwal lying dead there.

        Which means that the said witness had not seen the appellant and one

        unknown miscreant assaulting the deceased by means of Bhujali and

        thus he does not happen to be the eye witness of the occurrence.

</p><p id="p_21">                          17. Though PW-1 and PW-5 happens to be cousin

        brother and own brother respectively of the deceased and may be

        dubbed as interested witnesses of the case, but it is the settled

        principles of law that merely being the interested witnesses,

        testimony of such witnesses must not be discarded outrightly rather it

        should be scanned and scrutinized cautiously and carefully. On

        careful and minute scanning of the testimony of PW-1 and PW-5, we

        find no material contradiction between the testimonies of the

        aforesaid witnesses inter se and between their testimonies and

        prosecution case rather their testimonies are worth credence and

        reliable.
</p>
<p id="p_22">                          18. On perusal of the medical evidence, such as post

        mortem repot and testimony of Dr. Shambhunath Singh (PW-4) who

        conducted the autopsy of the dead body of the deceased, it appears

        that the doctor has found six incised wound on various parts of the

        person of the deceased including the neck and has opined the cause

        of death due to hemorrhage and shock due to said injuries specially

        No.2 i.e. neck injury caused by sharp cutting weapon. Thus, medical

        evidence also goes to corroborate the aforesaid prosecution case.

</p><p id="p_23">                          19. As per the prosecution case, the bone of contention

        is the previous animosity. The informant (PW-5) in Para-4 of his

        examination-in-chief has stated that the occurrence had taken place

        due to demand of extortion earlier. He (deceased) had informed the

        SDJM earlier regarding the same in writing on the date of occurrence

        and the said statement of the informant stands corroborated by

        exhibit-7 which is an informatory petition dated 09.07.2010 given by

        the deceased to SDJM, Chapra regarding the demand of weekly

        extortion of Rs. 500/- by the appellant and others on 07.07.2010 at 12

        O'clock and extending threatening of dire consequences. The said

        petition was received in the office of SDJM on 09.07.2010 itself. The

        said document has been approved by PW-9 who happens to be the

        formal witness of the case. Thus, the motive behind the occurrence,

        which was of demand of extortion by the appellant from the deceased

        with the threat of dire consequences, stands substantiated by the

        prosecution. I.O. Jay Prakash (PW-7) has proved the place of

        occurrence.

<p id="p_24">                          20. Submission of the learned defence counsel that one

        of the F.I.R. named witness, namely, Rajesh Singh has not been

        examined by the prosecution and no explanation has been assigned

        by the prosecution for his non-examination which creates serious

        doubt about the prosecution case does not appear convincing and

        acceptable to us. Because it is the prosecution who has to decide as

        to which witness it wants to examine in support of its case. It cannot

        be forced to examine any particular witness. Moreover, the witnesses

        examined by the prosecution as discussed above have fully

        substantiated the prosecution case by their consistent, trustworthy

        and reliable testimony. Hence, non-examination of the said witness

        does not go to shatter the prosecution case.
</p>
<p id="p_25">                          21. Further submission of the learned defence counsel

        is that the occurrence is said to have taken place at 06:30 P.M. and

        the police arrived within 15 minutes at the place of occurrence on the

        information given by some other person and the written report was

        furnished to it by the informant on his arrival indicates that the

        occurrence had taken place preceding to the aforesaid time as there

        was no evidence adduced by the prosecution that the informant had

        kept pen and paper at the aforesaid time and wrote down the written

        report and handed over the same to the police on his arrival within

        short span of time of 15 minutes. Said submission of learned defence

        counsel also does not appear to be convincing and acceptable to us

        because albeit the police is said to have arrived at 06:45 P.M. and the

        occurrence is said to be of 06:30 P.M, but it might not be the exact

        time as mentioned in the written report. There might be some

        variation of time and a bit earlier time might have been mentioned in

        the written report as time of occurrence. Moreover, the burden was

        on the defence to cross-examine the prosecution witness regarding

        keeping of the pen and paper at the time and place of occurrence by

        the informant. But it failed to discharge its aforesaid burden.

</p><p id="p_26">                          22. Further submission of the learned defence counsel

        that F.I.R. was lodged on 10.07.2010 at 04 A.M., but the same was

        sent to the Court on 11.07.2010 after delay of one day, which creates

        serious doubt about the prosecution case also does not appear

        convincing and acceptable to us, because the delay of one day in

        sending the F.I.R. to the Court does not appear to be so inordinate

        and abnormal to smack otherwise. Moreover, in view of the aforesaid

        consistent, reliable and worth credence ocular and documentary

        evidence of the prosecution, the aforesaid delay in sending the F.I.R.

        to the Court does not have potential to rule out the prosecution case.

</p><p id="p_27">                          23. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case

        and evidence of the prosecution, we find and hold that the

        prosecution has successfully substantiated its case and accusation

        levelled against the appellant by adducing cogent, consistent, reliable

        and worth credence ocular and documentary evidence. We do not

        find any irregularities and impropriety in the impugned judgment and

        order of conviction and sentence passed by the learned lower court

        warranting our intervention. Accordingly, the appeal is hereby

                   dismissed and impugned judgment and order of conviction and
