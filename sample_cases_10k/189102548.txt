HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD
 
 

?Court No. - 65
 

 
Case :- CRIMINAL REVISION No. - 3064 of 2019
 

 
Revisionist :- Mohd. Nasir
 
Opposite Party :- State Of U.P. And 2 Ors.
 
Counsel for Revisionist :- Pradeep Kumar Mishra
 
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
 

 
Hon'ble Dinesh Kumar Singh-I,J.
</pre> 
<p id="p_1">Heard Sri Vinay Saran, learned Senior counsel assisted by Sri Pradeep Kumar Mishra, learned counsel for the revisionist and Sri G. P. Singh, learned A.G.A. for the State.
</p> 
<p id="p_2">This revision has been preferred with a prayer to set-aside the judgment and order dated 26.06.2019 by which the application No. 5 Kha under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 193</a> Cr.P.C. was rejected, passed by First Additional Sessions Judge Badaun passed in Sessions Trial No. 170 of 2018, arising out Crime No. 613 of 2016, under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Section 302</a>, <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_3">307</a> of I.P.C., Police Station Kotwali, District Badaun. 
</p> 
<p id="p_3">It is argued by the learned counsel for the applicant that impugned order has been erroneously passed by the trial court by rejecting the application of the informant/prosecution dated 24.08.2018 whereby a prayer was made that the co-accused Sharafat S/o Ahmad Hussain and Raja S/o Sharafat against them cognizance be also taken. The reliance has been placed upon law laid down in Dharam Pal and Others Vs. State of Haryana and Another 2013 0 AIR(SC) 3018. 
</p> 
<p id="p_4">Relevant para no. 28 and 29 of the above-mentioned case are reproduced hereinbelow:
</p> 
<p id="p_5">28. In that view of the matter, we have no hesitation in agreeing with the views expressed in Kishun Singh's case (supra) that the Session Courts has jurisdiction on committal of a case to it, to take cognizance of the offences of the persons not named as offenders but whose complicity in the case would be evident from the materials available on record. Hence, even without recording evidence, upon committal under <a href="/doc/323386/" id="a_4">Section 209</a>, the Session Judge may summon those persons shown in column 2 of the police report to stand trial along with those already named therein. 
</p> 
<p id="p_6">29. We are also unable to accept Mr. Dave's submission that the Session Court would have no alternative, but to wait till the stage under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_5">Section 319</a> Cr.P.C. was reached, before proceeding against the persons against whom a prima facie case was made out from the materials contained in the case papers sent by the learned Magistrate while committing the case to the Court of Session. 
</p> 
<p id="p_7">It is argued that in the present case, according to the F.I.R. there were five accused named and out of whom charge-sheet have been submitted against two accused namely Anwar Kamal alias Lalla Kuraishi and Nanhe Kasai only while against rest of the accused Sarafat, Raja and Hashim, the Investigating Officer has not found them guilty and hence, final report was submitted against them. It is further argued that during course of the proceedings, the co-accused Hashim has expired but still Sarafat and Raja are alive who were prayed to be summoned but the trial court vide order dated 24.08.2018 has wrongly rejected the application holding that the prosecution should wait till the stage of Section 319 Cr.P.C. 
</p> 
<p id="p_8">I find that the point of law cited by learned counsel for the applicant, which is cited above, the Sessions Court has jurisdiction to take cognizance against such accused/offenders also against them if it finds material on record after committal of case before it. There is no need for the court to wait till the stage of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_6">Section 319</a> Cr.P.C.. Therefore, in view of the above, the impugned order is set-aside without issuing notice to the Opposite Party Nos. 2 and 3, because it is only innocuous order being passed to decide the matter afresh in the law laid down in the above cited case.
</p> 
<p id="p_9">In case, the Opposite Party Nos. 2 and 3 have any prejudice then they may approach this Court. Accordingly, the impugned order is set-aside with a direction to trial court to decide the matter afresh in accordance with law laid down in Dharampal (Supra). 
</p> 
<p id="p_10">Accordingly, this revision is disposed of. 
</p> 
<p id="p_11">Order Date :- 26.8.2019
