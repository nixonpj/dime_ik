                                                      Date of decision:12.5.2009

Present:    Mr. Amarjit Singh Virk, Advocate for the petitioner.

            Mr. Ajay Singh Ghangas, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana
            for the respondent-State.

<p id="p_1">            On the last date of hearing, leaned counsel for the State had

submitted that the petitioner has given his specimen signatures, however, a

communication had been received from FSL, Madhuban asking for some old

hand-writing/signatures of the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_2">            Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the

petitioner has a salary register where his old signatures are available besides he

has given his specimen hand-writing also before the Naib Tehsildar. Besides,

the signatures of the petitioners on old bank account are also available, however,

no old hand-writing is available with him.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            Learned counsel for the State has submitted that for the purpose of

meeting the requirement of the FSL, Madhuban old hand-writing is also

required.    Otherwise it is accepted that the petitioner has joined the

investigation.
</p><p id="p_4">                                                     Cr. Misc. No.M-11969 of 2008
                                         [2]

             Learned counsel appearing for the complainant has submitted that

the petitioner is the king-pin in the entire FIR and, therefore, he is not entitled to

the concession of pre-arrest bail.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             After giving my thoughtful consideration to the matter, it may be

noticed that the petitioner during the investigation of the case has cooperated

with the investigation and he has given his specimen hand-writing as also his

specimen signatures. The same are subject matter of consideration by the FSL

Madhuban. The charge-report in the case has not been filed.

</p><p id="p_6">             In the circumstances, it would be just and expedient that the interim

bail granted by this Court on 12.5.2008 continues till the filing of charge-report

by the Police.     On filing of the charge-report, the petitioner shall file an

application seeking regular bail which shall be considered on merit on the basis

of allegations available on record and uninfluenced by any observation of this

Court. Meanwhile, the petitioner shall also join the investigation as and when

called.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             The criminal miscellaneous petition stands disposed of.
