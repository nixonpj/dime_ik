<div class="doc_title">Grasim Industries Ltd. vs Labour Department on 3 April, 2018</div><pre id="pre_1">    HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH; BENCH AT INDORE

                  Writ Petition No.4685 of 2016.
              (Grasim Industries Limited v/s State of M.P. and others)

Indore; Dated : 03.04.2018:-
     Shri Shashank Sharma, learned counsel for the
petitioner.
      Shri Piyush Shrivastava, learned Govt. Advocate for
the Respondent Nos.1 and 2/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Shri Amit Dube, learned counsel for the Respondent
No.3.
</p><p id="p_2">      Learned counsel for the petitioner and the Respondents
jointly submit that the identical writ petitions have been
decided by this Court vide judgment dated 19.12.2016.
Therefore, the present petition be also decided in the same
terms. The order dated 19.12.2016 is reproduced below :-
</p>
<p id="p_3">  "03.    The facts of the case reveal that the petitioner Company is
  incorporated and registered Company under the provisions of
  <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, 1956 and is having a factory at Birlagram, Nagda,
  District Ujjain. It has been further stated that service conditions of the
  employees are governed by M.P. Employment (Standing Orders) Act,
  1961. It has been further sated that the age of superannuation as per
  standard orders is 58 years with discretion of employer to extend it upto
  60 years, as may be necessary. It has been further stated that the dispute
  arouse between the workman and the employer in respect of
  continuance of employees upto the age of 60 years. The dispute was
  raised before the Labour Conciliation Officer, Ujjain and the
  Conciliation Officer has referred the dispute for adjudication, keeping
  in view the statutory provisions as contained under <a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_2">section 10</a> of the
  Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The Annexure-P-1 dated 20-02-2015 is
  on record and the dispute as per the appendix has been referred to
  Labour Court, Ujjain for adjudication.
</p><p id="p_4">          Petitioner's contention is that during pendency of the dispute the
  Labour Commissioner, Indore has passed the impugned order dated
  02-12-2015(Anneuxre-P-5) and has transferred the dispute, which is
  pending for adjudication at Labour Court, Ujjain to the Industrial
  Tribunal, Indore. Learned counsel for the petitioner has raised a ground
  before this court that without hearing the petitioner employer such an
  order could not have been passed for transferring the dispute to
  Industrial Tribunal and in all fairness an opportunity of hearing should
  have been granted to the petitioner employer.
</p><p id="p_5">          To bolster his arguments he has placed reliance upon a
  judgment
  passed in the case of Management of M.S. Nally Bharat Engineering
  Company Ltd., Vs. State of Bihar reported in (1990) 0 Supreme (SC)
 18705.
</p><p id="p_6">        On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for the workman
has vehemently argued before this court that the dispute in question can
be resolved by the Industrial Tribunal and as large number of cases
were pending before various Labour Court in order to ensure that a
similar order is passed in all those cases, the matter has been
transferred from the labour court to the Industrial Tribunal. He has
prayed for dismissal of the writ petition.
</p><p id="p_7">        This court has carefully gone through the order dated
20-02-2015 and the same reveals that the Additional Labour
Commissioner/Conciliation Officer has forwarded the dispute to the
Labour Court, Ujjain for adjudication.
</p><p id="p_8">        The proceedings were started before the Labour Commissioner
for adjudication and parties have marked their presence also. However
another order was passed subsequently, which is on record Annexure-
P-5 dated 02-12-2015 and the dispute has been transferred to Industrial
Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_9">        The judgment delivered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Management of M.S. Nally Bharat Engineering Company Ltd.,
(supra) in paragraph-24 and 25 held as under :-
</p>
<p id="p_10">  "24. In the present case, the State has withdrawn the pending
  reference from the Labour Court, Dhanbad and transferred it to
  another Labour Court at the distant District of Patna, on the
  representation of the workman, without getting it verified from
  the management. The State in fairness ought to have got it
  verified by giving an opportunity to the management which is a
  party to the pending reference. Denial of that opportunity is a
  fatal flaw to the decision of the government.
</p>
<p id="p_11">  25. The management need not establish particular prejudice for
  want of such opportunity. In S.L. Kappor Vs. Jagmohan (1980) 4
  SCC 379 Chinnappa Reddy, J., after referring to the observation
  of Donaldson, J., in Altco Ltd. Vs. Suterland (1971) 2 Lloyds Rep
  515 said that the concept that justice must not only be done but
  be seen to be done in basic to our system and it is concerned not
  with a case of actual injustice but with the appearance of injustice
  or possible injustice. It was emphasized that the principles of
  natural justice know of no exclusionary rule dependent on
  whether it would have made any difference if natural justice had
  been observed. The non observance of natural justice is itself
  prejudice to any man and proof of prejudice independently of
  proof of denial of natural justice is unnecessary."
</p>
<p id="p_12">        In light of the aforesaid, the judgment delivered by Hon'ble
Supreme Court as the employer, who is party to the dispute was not
given opportunity of hearing, the impugned order passed by the
Labour Commissioner dated 02-12-2015 (Annexure-P-5) is hereby
quashed.
</p><p id="p_13">        The parties are directed to appear before the Labour Court on
04-01-2017. It is needless to mention that the Labour Commissioner
shall thereafter be free to pass an appropriate order, in accordance with
law. In all other connected cases also the impugned orders are hereby
quashed. The parties are directed to appear before the respective
Labour Commissioner on 04-01-2017.
</p><p id="p_14">        No order as to costs."
</p><p id="p_15">          The order dated 19.12.2016 shall apply mutatis
 mutandis to the present petition. In view of the above, the
 present petition is decided with the direction to the
 petitioner and the Respondents to appear before the Labour
 Court, Ujjain on 24.04.2018.
</p><p id="p_16">         No order as to costs.
</p><p id="p_17">         Cc as per rules.
</p><p id="p_18">                                       [ VIVEK RUSIA ]
                                            JUDGE
