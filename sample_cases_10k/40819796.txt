                         (BHAGWANDAS Vs MUNNA)


01-02-2017

      Shri R.S. Khare, learned counsel for the applicant.
      Shri Prakash Gupta, learned Panel Lawyer for the respondent
no.2, State.
      Heard.
      This is the first application under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Section 438</a> of Cr. P. C. for
grant of anticipatory bail to the applicant, as he is under apprehension
of his arrest in connection of Crime No./Complaint Case No. 95 of
16, registered as complaint case pending before the JMFC,
Tikamgarh for commission of offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_2">Sections
467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_3">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_4">471</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_5">420</a> of IPC.
      The case is registered on the basis of a private complaint
case.
      This court passed the following interim order on 03.11.2016
:-


           "Shri R.S. Khare, learned counsel for the applicant.
           Shri Prakash Gupta, learned Panel Lawyer for the State.
           Heard on admission.
           Issue notice, returnable in four weeks.
           Also heard on IA No. 20062 of 16, an application for
     grant of interim anticipatory bail.
           The case has been registered as Crime No. 95 of 16 on
     the basis of a private complaint before the JMFC, Tikamgarh
     for commission of offence under <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_6">Sections 467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_7">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_8">471</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_9">420</a>
     of IPC.
           The Supreme Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/855018/" id="a_10">Inder Mohan
 Goswami and another vs. State of Uttaranchal and others</a>
reported in (2007) 12 SCC 1 has held as under in regard to
issuance of non-bailable warrant in the event of registration of a
Criminal Case on a private complaint :-
           "54. As far as possible, if the court is of the opinion
     that a summon will suffice in getting the appearance of the
     accused in the court, the court, the summon or the bailable
     warrants should be preferred. The warrants either bailable or
     non-bailable should never be issued without proper scrutiny
     of facts and complete application of mind, due to the
     extremely serious consequences and ramifications which
     ensue on issuance of warrants. The court must very carefully
     examine whether the criminal complaint or FIR has not been
     filed with an oblique motive.
     55. In complaint cases, at the first instance, the Court should
     direct serving of the summons alongwith the copy of the
     complaint. If the accused seems to be avoiding the
     summons, the Court, in the second instance should issue
     bailable warrant. In the third instance, when the Court is
     fully satisfied that the accused is avoiding the Court's
     proceedings intentionally, the process of issuance of non-
     bailable warrant should be resorted to. Personal liberty is
     paramount, therefore, we question Courts at the first and
     second instance to refrain from issuing non-bailable
     warrants."


      In view of the law laid down by the Apex Court, the
application is allowed and the applicant is extended the benefit of
ad interim anticipatory bail.
             It is further directed that in the event of the arrest of the
      applicant in connection of aforesaid crime, on furnishing a
      personal bond of Rs. 50,000- (Rs. Fifty Thousand) alongwith
      one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court,
      the applicant shall be released on ad interim anticipatory bail.
            C c as per rules."


      In view of the principle laid down by the Apex Court in
<a href="/doc/855018/" id="a_11">Inder Mohan Goswami and another vs. State of Uttaranchal and
others</a> reported in (2007) 12 SCC 1 quoted above, the interim
order dated 03.11.2016 is hereby made absolute.
       C c as per rules.
