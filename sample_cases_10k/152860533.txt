RAJIVE BHALLA, J (Oral)

           By way of this order, we shall dispose of Civil Writ Petition

Nos.14622, 23480 of 2010 and 90 of 2011, as they involve

adjudication of similar questions of fact and law. For the sake of

convenience, facts are being taken from CWP No.14622 of 2010.

</p><p id="p_3">           The petitioners pray for issuance of a writ in the nature of

certiorari for quashing orders dated 14.03.2008 (Annexure P-9) and

24.02.2010 (Annexure P-12), passed by the Collector-cum-Divisional

Deputy Director, Rural Development and Panchayat, Jalandhar and

the Director, Rural Development and Panchayat Department, Punjab

(exercising the powers of Commissioner), respectively.

</p><p id="p_4">           Counsel for the petitioner, states that while dismissing the

petition under Section 11 of the Punjab Village Common Lands

(Regulation) Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the '1961 Act'),

neither the Collector nor the Appellate Authority have considered the

revenue record     that   clearly establishes   that the petitioner's

predecessors were in cultivating possession of the land in dispute,

prior to 26.01.1950. It is further contended that the Collector has not

adverted to this evidence and, though, the Appellate Authority has

referred to relevant jamabandies but while deciding the petition, has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Civil Writ Petition No.14622 of 2010                    -3-</span>

merely recorded that the petitioner has not been able to produce any

evidence of his cultivating possession, before 26.01.1950.      It is

argued that as the impugned orders have been passed without

considering the evidence on record, the writ petition may be allowed,

order passed by the Appellate Authority, may be set aside and the

Appellate Authority should be directed to decide the appeal afresh

and in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_5">           Counsel for the Gram Panchayat submits that as the land

in dispute has been mutated in the name of the Gram Panchayat,

and the petitioners have not produced any evidence about their

possession before 26.01.1950, the impugned orders should be

affirmed and the writ petition should be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_6">           We have heard counsel for the parties and perused the

impugned orders.
</p>
<p id="p_7">           The petitioner, filed a petition under Section 11 of the

1961 Act, claiming exclusion of the land in dispute from "Shamilat

Deh" on the plea that they were in cultivating possession of the land

in dispute prior to 1950. In support thereof, the petitioner produced

certain revenue record, in evidence. The Collector, without adverting

to the revenue record, dismissed the petition on the sole ground that

the land has been recorded as ownership of the Gram Panchayat.

The Appellate Authority adverted to the revenue record, but, while

dismissing the appeal, recorded a cryptic finding, without discussing

the relevant revenue record, that the petitioner has not been able to

produce evidence regarding his cultivating possession, of the land in

dispute, before 1950. We are, therefore, satisfied that the Appellate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Civil Writ Petition No.14622 of 2010                      -4-</span>

Authority, has passed the impugned order without considering

relevant evidence and would, therefore, be required to re-consider

the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_8">              In view of what has been stated hereinabove, we allow

the writ petition, in part, set aside order dated 24.02.2010, passed by

the Director, Rural Development and Panchayat Department, Punjab

and restore the appeal to his court for adjudication afresh and in

accordance with law, after taking into consideration the revenue

record produced by the petitioner and the Gram Panchayat.

</p><p id="p_9">              Parties are directed to appear before the learned

Commissioner on 07.06.2012, who shall decide the matter within

three months.</p><pre id="pre_2">
