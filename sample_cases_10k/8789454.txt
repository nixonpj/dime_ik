</p>
<p id="p_2">            The aforesaid FIR was registered at the behest of complainant

Navpreet Kaur, who is wife of the petitioner. As per the FIR, the complainant

has studied upto BBA, MBA and her marriage was solemnised with the

petitioner on 03.09.2016. On pre-marriage and post-marriage ceremonies, the

parents of complainant had spent a huge amount beyond their capacity as per

demands of the accused. At the time of finalisation of the matrimonial

alliances, the accused had told the parents of the complainant that the

petitioner is an intelligent and educated boy having passed the Diploma of

Medical Engineering from R.A.D. Centre, Ludhiana and is Director of J.P.

Cycles Pvt. Ltd. He does not take any intoxicant and is physically fit. The

Roka ceremony was solemnised at Raddison Hotel, Ludhiana on 25.12.2015,

where parents of the complainant had given one gold chain of 5 Tolas to the

petitioner and Rs.11,000/- as Shagun. Similarly, everybody who attended the

function was given Rs.1100/- as Shagun. A total sum of Rs.2,50,000/- was

function. The parents of complainant had given one diamond ring, gold Kara,

gold ginni and Rs.51,000/- in cash as Shagun. The other items as AC and

LED were given to the petitioner, whereas costly clothes were given to

accused Surinder Kaur (mother-in-law) and Harpreet Kaur (sister-in-law/

Jethani). Shagun was given to everybody, who attended the function and an

amount of Rs.15 lakh was incurred on this function alone. Thereafter, the

petitioner had demanded camera Sony make on the occasion of his birthday

on 03.08.2016 and this demand was fulfilled. At the time of marriage, about

600 persons participated in the Barat which was warmly welcomed. As per

the demand of the accused, one refrigerator, washing machine, double bed,

almirah and iron Peti were given to the accused as Streedhan. One gold set

each to accused Surinder Kaur (mother-in-law) and Harpreet Kaur (sister-in-

law/ Jethani) and one gold set to the grandmother-in-law, 11 Milnis with gold

ear-rings and gold rings, one gold Kara, one gold bracelet, one gold chain and

beddings, 101 utensils and other gifts to the petitioner in the shape of

Streedhan of the complainant. However, after the marriage, all the accused in

one voice started taunting the complainant that her parents had not solemnised

the marriage as per the status of the accused, nor they had given the dowry

articles as per the status and liking of the accused. When accused Balwinder

Singh (father-in-law) and Surinder Kaur (mother-in-law) came to know that

the aforesaid Creta car is registered in the name of the complainant, they

started raising demand from the parents of the complainant for transfer of

registration of the car in the name of accused Balwinder Singh (father-in-

law). They had also given a threat that in case the demand is not fulfilled, they

will give beatings to the complainant and will turn her out from the

matrimonial house. Under the compelling circumstances, the parents of

complainant had spent a sum of Rs.1 lakh on accessories of the Creta car.

</p><p id="p_4">             After few days, the complainant had come to know that the

accused had told a lie about his educational qualification and when she asked

the petitioner to show the certificates of his educational qualification, he made

false excuse that his niece had torn those certificates. After some time, the

complainant also came to know that there is an iron rod in the left leg of the

petitioner as his left leg got fractured in the year 2007. The petitioner is also

having stone and is suffering from cervical and other ailments, but this fact

was kept concealed from the complainant. The petitioner is also suffering

from sleeping problem and accused Surinder Kaur (mother-in-law) used to

make him to sleep. The petitioner is also not having control over his hands

and accused Surinder Kaur (mother-in-law) used to make him to eat meals.

All the accused in connivance with each other and under pre-planned scheme

concealed these facts from the complainant and her parents. One day, the

complainant after getting permission from the petitioner went to beauty

parlour along with accused Surinder Kaur (mother-in-law), but petitioner at

the instance of other co-accused gave merciless beatings to the complainant as

she got late by 5 minutes. Thereafter, again when the complainant had gone

to see the newly born child of accused Harpreet Kaur, the petitioner caught

hold her from her neck and also gave kick blows in her stomach.

</p><p id="p_6">            On 13.06.2017, the complainant delivered a female child in

Suman Hospital and all the expenses of the hospital were borne by the parents

of the complainant. The accused were not happy with the birth of a female

child. The accused harassed the complainant for demand of dowry many

times and the petitioner used to beat her. He even tried to kill her and

ultimately, the parents of complainant took her with them and now, she is

residing in her parental house. Panchayats were convened time and again, but

the accused persons are not ready to rehabilitate the complainant. Neither they

have returned the Streedhan of the complainant nor paid any maintenance to

her.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that from the

wedlock, a daughter was born and the petitioner is taking care of the daughter,

who is about 1½ years of age as the complainant has left the matrimonial

home. The marriage was simple and no dowry was demanded before or after

the marriage as alleged in the FIR. The parents of the complainant are living

in the same locality and are continuously interfering in the day to day family

affairs of the petitioner. They, rather, insisted the petitioner to stay in his in-

laws' house. The complainant left the matrimonial home on 10.03.2018 and

had taken away all the gold ornaments and the ornaments given to her by the

family of the petitioner. The complainant is a lady of hot temperament. The

efforts made by the petitioner to get her back have failed and the present FIR

is motivated. Since it has always been the intention of the petitioner to keep

his wife with him, he had filed a petition under <a href="/doc/322349/" id="a_4">Section 9</a> of the Hindu

Marriage Act, 1955, which is pending before the matrimonial Court and now

fixed for 16.05.2019. The petitioner also served a notice dated 31.07.2018 to

the complainant for taking back the articles i.e. AC, LED, refrigerator,

washing machine, almirah, sofa etc. from the house of the petitioner.The

complainant has also filed a complaint under <a href="/doc/1933289/" id="a_5">Section 12</a> of the Protection of

Women from <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_6">Domestic Violence Act</a> against the entire family of the

petitioner which is pending before the Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             On the other hand, learned counsel for the complainant has

argued that it is on account of harassment and demand of dowry, the

complainant had no option except to leave the matrimonial home. Otherwise,

no wife would like to leave her matrimonial home. The recovery of dowry

articles is yet to be effected which include the gold ornaments, as only part of

recovery has been effected in the case. There are specific allegations against

the petitioner and, therefore, custodial interrogation of the petitioner is

required as recovery is yet to be effected.

            Vide order dated 25.01.2019 passed by this Court, arrest of the

petitioner was stayed and the parties were directed to remain present in Court.

Pursuant thereto, the parties came present in Court and the matter was sent to

the Mediation and Conciliation Centre of this Court. However, the matter

could not be resolved there.
</p>
<p id="p_12">            The marriage of the petitioner solemnised with the complainant

on 03.09.2016 and the birth of a female child on 13.06.2017 is not in dispute.

The allegations as made in the FIR do reflect that there are temperamental

differences between the parties. There are allegations in the FIR that the

petitioner is solely dependent upon his mother. The female child of 1 ½ years

is being looked after by the petitioner and his family members as the

complainant has left the matrimonial home.
</p>
<p id="p_13">            The allegations levelled by the complainant that she was

subjected to cruelty and harassment on account of demand of dowry and her

condition became worse when she gave birth to the girl child are yet to be

established during the trial. Number of times the matter has been intervened

by the Panchayat and compromise was also effected, but differences continue

to survive. In the FIR, there are allegations against the petitioner that his

behaviour was not like an educated person and the complainant came to know

that there is an iron rod in the left leg of the petitioner as his left leg was

fractured in the year 2007. The petitioner has also stone and suffering from

cervical and other ailments and these facts were concealed by the accused

from the complainant. The petitioner is also suffering from sleeping problem

and it is his mother, who is used to make him sleep. The petitioner is so

dependent upon his mother that whenever he is used to wake up, the work of

his topknot, clothes, tying turban, shoes, socks etc. is done by his mother. The

petitioner is not used to take his meal with his own hand. May be that the

petitioner is a pampered son, but having rod in his left leg and he is a patient

of cervical and stone cannot be stated to be a ground that the petitioner has

harassed the complainant. The complainant may have personal problems with

the petitioner-husband, but these facts have been made part of the complaint.

</p><p id="p_14">             Therefore, without commenting on the motive of the

complainant, but considering the fact that out of the wedlock, a girl child is

born, who is about 1 ½ years of age and is living with her father, this Court

finds that the petitioner deserves to be admitted on anticipatory bail. The part

recovery itself is no ground to decline him the benefit of anticipatory bail.

</p><p id="p_15">             Accordingly, the present petition is allowed and in case the

police finds any material against the petitioner warranting his arrest, he shall

be given one week clear notice in advance so as to enable him to avail the

appropriate remedy according to law.
</p>
<p id="p_16">             However, the petitioner shall join the investigation as and when

directed by the investigating agency and shall abide by the terms and

conditions laid down under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_7">Section 438(2)</a> Cr.P.C.</p><pre id="pre_2">
