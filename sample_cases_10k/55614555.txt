learned   Counsel   for   applicant,     and   Shri   Pathak,   learned

Counsel for non-applicant. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">2)               By this application, it is prayed by applicant wife that

Hindu   Marriage   Petition   No.125/2017   filed   by   non-applicant

husband for restitution of conjugal rights, which is  pending on

the  file   of 4th  Joint Civil  Judge, Senior Division, Nagpur,   be

transferred to the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division, Akola.

Pending   present   application,   this   Court   by   interim   order   had

granted stay to further proceedings of  Hindu Marriage Petition

No.125/2017.

<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">3)               Non-applicant pending this application has taken out

Civil Application No.1429/2017 and submitted that in addition

to the proceedings initiated by him for restitution of conjugal

rights as aforesaid, applicant wife has filed application  under

the provisions of Protection of Women from <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_1">Domestic Violence

Act</a>,   2005   being   Criminal   Application   No.93/2017,   which   is

pending on the file of learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class,

Murtizapur   and   Hindu   Marriage   Petition   No.72/2017   for

divorce,   which   is   pending   on   the   file   of   Civil   Judge,   Senior

Division, Akola.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">4)               The proceedings for restitution of conjugal rights are

initiated   by   non-applicant   husband   at   Nagpur.     It,   therefore,

goes   without   saying   that   after   initiating   proceedings   by

applicant as aforesaid at Murtizapur and Akola, non-applicant

has   filed   proceedings   for   restitution   of   conjugal   rights   at

Nagpur.     As  such,   proceedings are  pending at  three different

Courts and non-applicant in that case is required to appear at

Courts at Murtizapur and Akola in addition to Court at Nagpur

wherein  he has initiated proceedings for restitution of conjugal

rights.</p><pre id="pre_2">



5)               Admittedly, applicant is residing at Murtizapur after




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">    ::: Uploaded on - 07/11/2017                    ::: Downloaded on - 08/11/2017 00:59:42 :::</span>
                                         4                           mca690.17

</pre><p id="p_10">there was matrimonial discord between the parties.   It is thus

the case of applicant that it is not convenient for her to attend

proceedings   initiated   by   non-applicant   at   Nagpur,   which   is

approximately 244 kms. from Murtizapur.   It is also the case of

applicant   that   for   attending   proceedings   at   Nagpur,   she   is

required to be accompanied by some member of the family and

in that event, she would be required to incur heavy expenses. 



</p><p id="p_11">6)               In that view of the matter and having considered the

fact that applicant is admittedly residing at Murtizapur and has

also initiated proceedings for grant of divorce before Court of

Civil Judge, Senior Division, Akola, in the interest of both the

parties, it would be just and proper to transfer the proceedings

initiated by non-applicant by way of  application for restitution

of conjugal rights, which is found pending in the Court of 4th

Joint   Civil   Judge,   Senior   Division,  Nagpur     to  the   competent

Court at Akola, though in that situation, non-applicant may be

required to travel from Nagpur to Akola.  However, for the sake

of convenience, both Hindu Marriage Petition Nos.72/2017 and




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">    ::: Uploaded on - 07/11/2017                 ::: Downloaded on - 08/11/2017 00:59:42 :::</span>
                                            5                          mca690.17

125/2017 can be placed for hearing before one and same Court

or   can   be   clubbed   together   by   the   concerned   Court   on   an

application made by parties to that effect.



</p><p id="p_12">7)               One   of   the   prayers   made   in   Civil   Application

No.1429/2017   by   non-applicant   is   also   for   transfer   of

proceedings   initiated   by   applicant   under   the   provisions   of

Protection   of   Women   from   <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_2">Domestic   Violence   Act</a>,   2005   to

Court at Akola.   The prayer made appears to be reasonable in

view of the fact that proceedings initiated by non-applicant at

Nagpur     since   for   convenience   of   applicant   is   allowed   to   be

transferred to Akola, non-applicant husband in that event would

be in a better position if proceedings under the provisions of

Protection  of  Women  from <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_3">Domestic  Violence  Act</a>, 2005   are

also transferred to Court at Akola, which in that event may not

cause any inconvenience to applicant wife as   she will have to

attend her divorce proceedings before Court at Akola.   In the

circumstances,   proceedings   initiated   by   applicant   under   the

provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence

under the provisions of the Protection of Women from <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_4">Domestic
