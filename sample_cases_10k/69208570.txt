                    I Addl.City Civil &amp; Sessions Judge,
                              Bangalore.

      This suit is filed by the plaintiff seeking judgment

and    decree    against the    defendant for recovery of

Rs.5Lakhs with interest and for grant of permanent

injunction restraining the defendant from alienating the

suit schedule property.

      2. In brief, plaintiff's case is that the defendant has

borrowed Rs.5 Lakhs from him as hand loan on 2.9.2014

agreeing to repay the same with interest at the rate of

24% p.a., within six months. In pursuance of the same,

defendant has executed loan agreement, pronote and

consideration receipt. In addition, defendant had given

documents of suit schedule property as security to the

loan to the plaintiff to proceed against the suit property

for recovery of loan amount if he fails to repay the loan

amount. Subsequently, the defendant who has paid 3 to

4 months' interest has failed to pay either interest or
                                3                O.S.No.7105/2016


principal amount inspite of several requests and inspite

of service of legal notice dated 18.8.2016.         Hence, the

suit.

        3. In response to the service of notice, defendant

has appeared through his counsel, but he has not filed

written statement.

        4. In proof of the suit claim, plaintiff got examined

himself as PW.1 and got marked Exs.p.1 to P4.

Defendant's side evidence taken as 'nil' since there was

no representation.

        5. Heard plaintiff's counsel arguments. Defendant's

side     arguments    taken   as   'nil'   as   there   was   no

representation.

        6. The points that arise for consideration of this

court are:

  1.Whether the plaintiff proves that the defendant
    has borrowed Rs.5 Lakhs from him on
    2.9.2014 agreeing to repay the same with
    interest at the rate of 24% pa ?

  2.     Whether the plaintiff further proves that the
        defendant has offered documents of suit
                                    4              O.S.No.7105/2016


     schedule property as security to the loan
     transaction ?

  3. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief
     sought for ?

  4. What order or decree ?

     7. My findings on the above points are:

       Point   No.1   :    In the affirmative
       Point   No.2   :   In the negative
       Point   No.3   :   Partly in the affirmative
       Point   No.4   :   As per final Order

for the following:
                           REASONS
     8. Point No.1 :           Plaintiff has contended that the

defendant has borrowed Rs.5 Lakhs as hand loan from

him on 2.9.2014 by executing loan agreement, pronote

and consideration receipt and agreed to repay the said

loan amount with interest at the rate of 24% p.a., within

six months. But, subsequently, the defendant has paid

interest for 3 to 4 months, and thereafter he has failed to

pay either interest or principal amount inspite of his

requests and issue of legal notice; hence this suit.
                               5              O.S.No.7105/2016


     9.    Plaintiff who has filed affidavit by way of

evidence in proof of his contention, has reiterated      the

plaint averments. He has produced loan agreement,

pronote, consideration receipt, copy of legal notice, postal

receipt with endorsement which are marked as Exs.P.1 to

P.4. Perusal of the same reveals that the defendant has

borrowed Rs.5 Lakhs from the plaintiff on 2.9.2014

agreeing to repay the same with interest at the rate of

24% p.a., and then he failed to repay the loan amount

inspite of issue of legal notice.       So, Exs.P.1 to P.4

supports    the    evidence      of   PW.1   which   stands

unquestioned.     Hence, there is no reason to disbelieve

the evidence of PW.1. So, from the evidence of PW.1 and

Exs.P.1 to P.4, it could be safely held that the plaintiff

has proved that the defendant had borrowed Rs.5 Lakhs

from him on 2.9.2014 agreeing to repay the same with

interest at the rate of 24% p.a. In the result, I answer

point No.1 in the affirmative.
                             6              O.S.No.7105/2016


     10. Point No.2 : Plaintiff has contended that the

defendant had given documents of the suit schedule

property as security to the loan amount to the plaintiff to

proceed against the suit property for recovery of loan

amount in case defendant fails to repay the loan amount.

No doubt, Ex.P.1 shows that the defendant has offered

suit property documents as security to the loan amount

to the plaintiff to proceed against the suit property for

recovery of loan amount in case defendant fails to repay

the loan amount as agreed. But, plaintiff has not

produced any such documents relating to the suit

property said to have been offered by the defendant.

Even plaintiff has not produced any document to show

that the suit property stands in the name of the

defendant. So, in the absence of any such documents,

fact that the defendant has offered the suit property

documents as security to the loan amount, cannot be

accepted. Hence, I hold that plaintiff has failed to prove

that the defendant had offered suit property documents
                                7                 O.S.No.7105/2016


as security to the loan transaction. In the result, I answer

Point No.2 in the negative.

     11. Point No.3 : Plaintiff has filed this suit seeking

judgment and decree against the defendant for recovery

of Rs.5 Lakhs with interest and for permanent injunction

restraining the defendant from alienating the               suit

schedule property in favour of third parties. But, since

the plaintiff is able to prove Point No.1 and failed to prove

Point No.2, I am to hold that the plaintiff is entitled for

judgment and decree       for recovery of the loan amount

with interest and not entitled for the relief of permanent

injunction.

     12. Plaintiff has claimed future interest at the rate

of   24%      p.a.,   which   is   exorbitant.     Taking   into

consideration the prevailing rate of interest in the

banking institutions at present, if the plaintiff is awarded

future interest at the rate of 6% p.a., it would be

reasonable. In the result, I answer Point No.3 partly in

the affirmative.
                                 8              O.S.No.7105/2016


     13. Point No.4 : Regard being had to the findings

on Points No.1 to 3 and the discussion made there

under, I am to hold that the suit of the plaintiff deserves

to be decreed in part.

     In the result, I proceed to pass the following :
                      ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">     The suit of the plaintiff is decreed in part with costs.
     Defendant is directed to pay a sum of Rs.5 Lakhs to

the plaintiff with interest at the rate of 24% p.a., thereon

from February 2015 till the date of decree and future

interest at the rate of 6% p.a., from the date of decree till

realization.
