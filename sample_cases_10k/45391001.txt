he signed Ex. PW-1/A, Portion-A was not written. He further
stated that this portion was written after registration of the FIR
by SI Man Singh (PW-1) at about 10.30 pm at the spot. PW-8
SI Jagdish Yadav has stated in his cross-examination that he
had only mentioned the FIR Number in Portion-A and except
that he had not written any other words. It is on the basis of
above responses of these witnesses that Ld. Amicus Curie
has submitted that recording of secret information vide
Ex. PW-1/A is doubtful because the particulars in Portion-A
were not in existence when this document is projected to have
been written. I have carefully gone through the testimony of
the witnesses of Ex. PW-1/A on record. The secret
information was recorded by PW-1 SI Man Singh vide
Ex. PW-1/A. PW-2 HC Kuldeep Singh and PW-9 HC Ram
Kumar are the witnesses of this recording. It is correct that
FIR Number and case particulars could not have been written
when this information was recorded because FIR was not
registered by them. But nothing has come in the testimony of
either the author of this document i.e. PW-1 HC Man Singh or
the witnesses of this document i.e. PW-2 HC Kuldeep Singh
and PW-9 HC Ram Kumar to suggest or indicate that FIR
Number and case particulars were written when the secret

information was recorded. Though, nothing has been put to
PW-1 SI Man Singh on this aspect, it has specifically come in
the cross-examination of PW-2 HC Kuldeep Singh and PW-9
HC Ram Kumar that when they signed this document,
Portion-A, which contains FIR Number and case particulars,
was not written on it. Rather PW-9 HC Ram Kumar has
clarified    further     that    this   Portion-A   was      written     after
registration of the FIR. Further, different versions of PW-8 SI
Jagdish Yadav and PW-9 HC Ram Kumar as to who recorded
this Portion-A will not demolish the authenticity of this
document because it is the time of recording of Portion-A
which is material and not the person. Testimony of all the
witnesses of this document is consistent on the fact that
Portion-A was not written when secret information was
recorded by PW-1 SI Man Singh vide Ex. PW-1/A. Moreover,
this aspect could have been explained only by SI Man Singh
(PW-1), who has not been cross-examined on this fact and
testimony of the witnesses of Ex. PW-1/A does not leave any
doubt that it was recorded prior to registration of the FIR.

was held by the Supreme Court that when the search, arrest

question of non-compliance of provisions of <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_20">Section 42</a> of

respect to search, seizure and arrest, <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_22">Section 42</a> of the NDPS

of the accused. It is submitted that though as per the
prosecution story, a Notice under <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_25">Section 50</a> of the NDPS Act

of the NDPS Act and clarified further that he never stated
before the Court that the Notice under <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_29">Section 50</a> of the

is contradiction in the statements of PW-10 SI Sohan Pal,
MHC(M) and Inspector Shiv Dayal (PW-7) with respect to the
time of deposit of pulandas of the case property in the
Malkhana, and second that there is contradiction in the
statements of PW-10 SI Sohan Pal, MHC(M) on one hand and
SI Man Singh (PW-1) and Inspector Shiv Dayal (PW-7) on the
other hand about number of pulandas deposited and the seals
on them.

cross-examination that Inspector Shiv Dayal (PW-7) had
deposited the case property in the Malkhana on 13.08.2008 at
about 12.00 Noon. It is argued by Ld. Amicus Curie that this
statement of MHC(M) about time of deposition of case
property demolishes the entire prosecution case because as
per the rukka and the FIR, Charas was recovered on

of the case property be deposited by the SHO (PW-7
Inspector Shiv Dayal) in the Malkhana through HC Sohan Pal
(PW-10) at 12.00 Noon. It is true that statement of PW-10 HC
Sohan Pal in the cross-examination about time of deposition
of the pulandas of the case property is contrary to the
prosecution case. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the
impact of this contradiction in the light of other evidence on
record.
</p><p id="p_38">24.          According to rukka Ex. PW-1/E prepared by SI Man
Singh (PW-1), Charas was recovered from the possession of
the accused at 05.50 pm. On the basis of this rukka, FIR was
registered by PW-3 HC Lovkesh Kumar on 13.08.2008 at
about 08.10 pm vide Ex. PW-3/A. It has come in the testimony
of PW-7 Inspector Shiv Dayal, SHO that before handing over
of the pulandas of the case property to MHC(M) PW-10 SI
Sohan Pal he mentioned the FIR Number on them. His
testimony on this fact has gone unassailed. Therefore, in any
circumstances, pulandas of the case property could not be
deposited before 08.10 pm. Since there is positive evidence
on record in the form of testimony of the witnesses i.e. PW-1
SI Man Singh, PW-7 Inspector Shiv Dayal and documents i.e.

two pulandas sealed with the seals of "MS" alongwith Form
FSL were deposited by Inspector Shiv Dayal on 13.03.2008,
whereas according to the prosecution case and deposition of
Inspector Shiv Dayal (PW-7) three pulandas bearing the seals
of "MS" &amp; "SD" were deposited by him in the Malkhana. on
13.08.2008.
</p><p id="p_40">26.          In    order     to    analyze     the   impact     of    above
contradictions, it is necessary to examine the relevant material
on record. After recovery of Charas from the possession of
accused, two samples were taken by SI Man Singh (PW-1),
which were converted into two pulandas S-1 &amp; S-2. The two
packets of recovered Charas were converted into separate
pulandas with mark S-3 &amp; S-4, which were kept in a third
pulanda. Testimony of PW-1 SI Man Singh is specific on the
fact that he affixed his seal of "MS" on the three pulandas
besides affixing his seal on FSL Form. Nothing has come in

his cross-examination to create any doubt about these facts.
He is duly corroborated on these facts by PW-1 SI Man Singh,
PW-9 HC Ram Kumar and public witness Arvind Kumar
(PW-4). Testimony of all the witnesses of recovery and
seizure is specific that the three pulandas of the case property
were handed over to Inspector Shiv Dayal (PW-7) at the spot,
who after satisfying himself affixed his seal of "SD" on those
pulandas at the spot and thereafter carried them with him
while leaving the spot. Testimony of Inspector Shiv Dayal
(PW-7) has gone unassailed on the above facts about number
of pulandas and seal impressions on them. Testimonies of
PW-7 Inspector Shiv Dayal is specific and has gone
unassailed on the fact that he handed over three sealed
pulandas bearing the seals of "MS" &amp; "SD" alongwith FSL
Form and carbon copy of seizure memo to HC Sohan Pal,
MHC(M) for depositing in the Malkhana on 13.08.2008. The
factual description of the pulandas of the case property has
come on record on their production in the Court during trial for
the first time in the testimony of PW-1 SI Man Singh. Total
three pulandas were produced. Pulandas marked S-1 &amp; S-2
containing remnant samples were produced with the seal of
"MS FSL DELHI" and the third pulanda containing recovered
Charas packets marked S-3 &amp; S-4 was produced with the

seals of "MS" &amp; "SD". Since the sample pulandas were sent to
FSL Rohini for analysis, the remnant samples were returned
with the seal of "MS FSL DELHI" and FSL Result Ex. P-X
clearly shows that parcel S-1 &amp; S-2 were received in the
laboratory with the seals of "MS" &amp; "SD", which were intact
and tallied with the specimen seals as per forwarding letter
(Form FSL). Therefore, the positive evidence on record in the
form of statements of witnesses of recovery and seizure, the
documentary evidence in the form of seizure memo and the
actual production of case property in the Court during trial
clearly establishes that three pulandas of the case property
were deposited in the Malkhana on 13.08.2008, which were
marked as S-1, S-2 &amp; S-3, all sealed with the seals of "MS" &amp;
"SD". Therefore, no doubt is created about statutory
compliance of <a href="/doc/1363838/" id="a_34">Section 55</a> of the NDPS Act. Inconsistency in
the statement of PW-10 HC Sohan Pal, MHC(M) is
inconsequential and could be possible due to failure of
memory over a period of time. {Reference to Dalel Singh's

arrived at the spot after apprehension and seizure and has
deposed as PW-5 on these facts. In view of the testimony of
this witness on record and the document Ex. PW-8/D,
compliance of <a href="/doc/669884/" id="a_38">Section 57</a> of NDPS Act is duly proved.
</p><p id="p_43">29.          A contention has been raised by Ld. Amicus Curie
that according to deposition of PW-10 SI Sohan Pal, two
sealed sample parcels were handed over to Ct. Uday Veer
Singh (PW-6) on 03.09.2008 for depositing at FSL Rohini,
which were brought back on the same day by Ct. Uday Veer
Singh (PW-6) due to objections from FSL Rohini. It is pointed
out that according to PW-10 SI Sohan Pal the two sealed
sample parcels bearing the seals of "MS" &amp; "SD" were sent
again through Ct. Uday Veer Singh (PW-6) on 04.09.2008, but
Ct. Uday Veer Singh while deposing as a witness in the Court

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                        26</span>

as PW-6 is totally silent about carrying the sample pulandas to
FSL Rohini at all on 03.09.2009. It is argued that silence of
PW-6 Ct. Uday Veer Singh about taking of sample pulandas
to FSL Rohini on 03.09.2009 and testimony of PW-10 HC
Sohan Pal that the samples were returned from FSL Rohini
with certain objections on 03.09.2009 create serious doubt
whether the report received from FSL Rohini is about the
samples of the Charas, which was allegedly recovered from
the possession of the accused.
</p><p id="p_44">30.          In order to appreciate the above arguments put-
forth, it was deemed necessary to peruse the record of
movement of the sample pulandas form Malkhana to FSL
Rohini. The requisite record was produced by IO SI Jagdish
Yadav, who was examined as a Court Witness and due
opportunity was given to the defence for cross-examination.
IO placed on record the certified copy of the letter dated
03.09.2008 (date of letter is wrongly typed in the deposition of
this witness as 03.02.2008) as Ex. CW-1/A by which sample
pulandas were returned to the police station. The Court
witness stated that objections have been indicated at Serial
No. 6, 11, and 12 of this letter by tick-mark and that he
removed the objections by attaching attested and legible
copies of the documents and about the quota and made

endorsement in this regard on the back of this letter at point P
to P-1 bearing his signature at point-X. The witness further
stated that sample was again sent on 04.09.2008 for
examination.
</p><p id="p_45">31.          Though, PW-6 Ct. Uday Veer Singh is silent about
taking the sealed sample pulandas to the FSL on 03.09.2008
but testimony of PW-10 HC Sohan Pal and the record i.e.
Register No. 19, Ex. PW-10/A clearly establish that the
sample pulandas were taken from MHC(M) (PW-10 HC
Sohan Pal) by Ct. Uday Veer Singh (PW-6) on 03.09.2008 for
depositing at FSL, which were returned on the same day by
FSL with certain objections. Ex. CW-1/A is the letter of FSL
dated 03.09.2008 vide which sample pulandas were returned.
This document of FSL indicates that objections raised were
with respect to attested and legible copies of the FIR, seizure
memo, quota for receiving the case property for the month of
September, 2008 and proper, complete and current Road
Certificate. There is no reason to disbelieve the testimony of
IO SI Jagdish Yadav as Court witness that the sample
pulandas were sent again on 04.09.2008 after removing the
objections. The three objections indicated in the letter of FSL
(Ex. CW-1/A) are related to the procedural formalities about
deposition of the samples at FSL and do not relate to the seal

on the pulanda, description or contents of the pulanda so as
to create any doubt about the case property. Return of the
sample pulandas by FSL on 03.09.2008 and its re-deposition
on 04.09.2008 is duly explained by the IO SI Jagdish Yadav,
who was recalled as a Court witness and there is no doubt
that the sample pulandas marked S-1 and S-2 were received
intact in FSL Rohini and are the true representatives of the
two packets of Charas recovered from the possession of the
accused.
</p><p id="p_46">32.                  Different   contradictions   pointed     out     by     the
Ld. Amicus Curie in the testimony of the witnesses are that :

             according to the prosecution story only seal of SI

             recording of their statements and about the time till

</p><p id="p_52">33.                  The impact of discrepancies and inconsistencies in
the statements of the recovery witnesses was considered by
the Apex Court in "State of Punjab V/s Lakhwinder Singh &amp;
Another, 2010(1) Drugs Cases (Narcotics) 192" where one
witness stated that the seal was handed over to "X" and the
other stated that it was handed over to "Y". The Apex Court

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                        30</span>

held that such contradictions are very minor discrepancies,
which do not in any manner affect the substratum of the case
and the offence alleged against the accused.
</p><p id="p_53">34.          In Dalel Singh's case (Supra) the witnesses of
recovery and seizure of contraband had given different
versions in their depositions about weight of the seized
contraband and the Apex Court held that since the documents
clearly brought out the weight of the contraband, the error
committed by the witnesses can be attributed to failure of
human memory, which is inconsequential.
</p><p id="p_54">35.          On careful perusal of deposition of public witness
Arvind Kumar (PW-4), it is found that he has spoken about
personal search of the accused in which Rs. 600/- &amp; original
Notice under <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_39">Section 50</a> of the NDPS Act were recovered and
search of thaila in possession of accused from which two
packets of Charas were recovered. Though, he has stated
specifically that personal search of the accused was
conducted by SI Man Singh (PW-1), which is not in tune with
the prosecution story, but with respect to search of thaila, he
does not say that it was conducted by SI Man Singh (PW-1).
Therefore, there is nothing contrary in the statement of public
witness Arvind Kumar (PW-4) viz-a-viz statement of other
witnesses on this aspect. However, contradiction in his

FIR No. 106/2008; PS : Chandni Chowk           State V/s.Vijay @ Ajay
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                        31</span>

statement about the person who conducted personal search
of the accused can be ignored as it does not go to the
substratum of the case affecting recovery.
</p><p id="p_55">36.          Coming to the contradiction pointed out in the
statement of PW-9 HC Ram Kumar about time of registration
of the FIR viz-a-viz other evidence on record, testimony of
PW-3 HC Lovkesh Kumar, Duty Officer and the documents
i.e. rukka (Ex. PW-1/E), endorsement of Duty Officer on the
rukka vide Ex. PW-3/B and FIR Ex. PW-3/A, clearly establish
that FIR was registered at 08.10 pm. Therefore, in no
circumstances the rukka could have been taken by PW-9 HC
Ram Kumar at the police station at 10.00 pm i.e. after
registration of the FIR. Error committed by PW-9 HC Ram
Kumar is inconsequential because the documentary evidence
and testimony of other witnesses has gone unassailed about
the time of FIR and does not leave any scope of doubt.
</p><p id="p_56">37.          Contradictions pointed out by Ld. Amicus Curie in
the statement of witnesses about who brought the taraju baat,
the time when the secret informer left the spot, the number of
seals handed over to the public witness, the place and time of
recording the statement of the witnesses and the time till the
witnesses remained at the spot do not affect the substratum of
the case and the recovery of Charas from the accused. In

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                        32</span>

view of above referred decisions of the Supreme Court they
are    minor      inconsistencies       and   deviations   which       are
inconsequential in nature.
</p><p id="p_57">38.          At one stage, during arguments it was submitted by
Ld. Amicus Curie that testimony of public witness Arvind
Kumar (PW-4) cannot be looked into as he has been declared
hostile.
</p><p id="p_58">39.          I have gone through the testimony of public witness
Arvind Kumar (PW-4). He has been cross-examined by Addl.
PP for the State. In the cross-examination by the Addl. PP,
the witness his signatures on the Notice under <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_40">Section 50</a> of
the NDPS Act and the seizure memo at point-X. He had also
admitted that all the pulandas alongwith Form FSL were
sealed by SI Man Singh with his seal of "MS" and by SHO
with the seal of "SD". He admitted that the pulandas alongwith
Form FSL and carbon copy of the seizure memo were taken
by SHO. I see no reason why this witness was cross-
examined by Addl. PP for the State. This witness has stated in
his examination-in-chief that he had signed the documents.
Being a public witness his incapacity to identity the documents
by name is understood. Due to passage of time, the witness
might have forgotten to depose about sealing of the case
property. It is a settled legal principle that if a witness has not

deposed on the line of the prosecution case on certain facts or
has turned hostile, his testimony cannot be rejected entirely.
In the present case though the public witness Arvind Kumar
(PW-4) has been cross-examined by Addl. PP for the State
but it has no impact on his deposition which is otherwise on
the lines of the prosecution story on material facts relating to
identification of the accused, circumstances of the incident,
search, recovery and seizure of the contraband from the
possession of the accused. Testimony of the public witness
Arvind Kumar          (PW-4) is found trustworthy and nothing has
come in the cross-examination to create any doubt about his
credibility.
</p><p id="p_59">40.            The last contention raised by Ld. Amicus Curie is
that there is delay in sending the sample pulandas to the FSL.
I have gone through the material on record about keeping of
the pulandas and their movement from one hand to another till
they were deposited at FSL Rohini. The delay has no
consequence on the fact that the samples were taken from
the Charas packets recovered form the possession of the
accused, which has been proved and established by the
cogent and reliable evidence. It has been established on
record that the sample pulandas alongwith pulanda of the
recovered Charas were handed over to SHO at the spot, who

deposited them intact in the Malkhana. Testimony of
witnesses on record is cogent on the fact that the sample
pulandas were deposited intact at FSL. Therefore, delay in
sending the sample pulandas did not and could not have
caused any prejudice to the accused. {Reference to "Hardip
Singh V/s State of Punjab, 2008 Drugs Cases (Narcotics)
409"}.
</p><p id="p_60">41.          It is established by the testimony of the witnesses
examined in the Court that PW-1 SI Man Singh constituted a
raiding party comprising of himself, PW-2 HC Kuldeep Singh,
PW-9 HC Ram Kumar and a public witness PW-4 Arvind
Kumar on the directions of PW-7 Inspector Shiv Dayal, SHO
pursuant to a secret information Ex. PW-1/A. Testimony of all
the witnesses of raiding party is consistent on the fact that
accused was apprehended on the pointing of the informer and
two packets of Charas were recovered from a thaila in his
possession. Testimony of the recovery witnesses is consistent
on the fact that prior to search, accused was duly informed
about the secret information with the police and about his
legal right to give his search in the presence of a Gazetted
Officer or a Magistrate vide Ex. PW-1/B, but the accused
refused to avail and his refusal was recorded vide
Ex. PW-1/C.

</p><p id="p_62">42.          Testimony of search and recovery witnesses on
record is consistent on the fact that the packets of Charas
were wrapped in brown tape. It is established that weight of
one packet was 425 Grams and other was 475 Grams. 100
Grams of Charas was taken out as sample from each packet
and were converted to pulandas with mark S-1 &amp; S-2 and the
packets of Charas were kept as it is and then put in a
separate pulanda. It is proved that all the three pulandas were
sealed by PW-1 SI Man Singh with his seal of "MS", who also
filled the FSL Form at the spot.
</p><p id="p_63">43.          Testimony of PW-7 Inspector Shiv Dayal, SHO is
cogent on the fact that he reached at the spot, where SI Man
Singh met him alongwith the accused and the staff and
handed over to him three sealed parcels. He has been
corroborated on these facts by all the recovery witnesses
including the public witness. Deposition of PW-5 Dr. Rajiv
Sharma, ACP about his arrival at the spot has gone
unassailed and he is also corroborated on the fact by the
other witnesses. Testimony of PW-7 Inspector Shiv Dayal,
SHO has gone unassailed on the fact that he affixed his seal
of "SD" on the three pulandas of the case property and FSL
Form. Testimony of PW-7 Inspector Shiv Dayal, SHO and
PW-5 Dr. Rajiv Sharma, ACP has gone unassailed on the fact

that they satisfied themselves about arrest and recovery of
Charas at the spot. It is proved by the testimony of PW-1 SI
Man Singh, other recovery witnesses and PW-7 Inspector
Shiv Dayal, SHO that pulandas of the case property were
handed over to SHO at the spot alongwith Form FSL and
carbon copy of the seizure memo.
</p><p id="p_64">44.          Registration of the FIR Ex. PW-3/A on the basis of

is proved by the testimony of PW-7 Inspector Shiv Dayal,
SHO, PW-10 HC Sohan Pal and Malkhana Register
Ex. PW-10/A that sealed pulandas of the case property were
deposited by the SHO in the Malkhana.
</p><p id="p_65">45.          Testimony of PW-8 SI Jagdish Yadav is cogent and
trustworthy on the fact that investigation of this case was
assigned to him after registration of the FIR and he conducted
the proceedings at the spot including preparation of Site Plan
(Ex. PW-8/A), arrest of the accused (Ex. PW-2/A), personal
search of the accused (Ex. PW-2/B) and interrogation of the

documents         i.e.    RC     No.     65/21      (Ex.   PW-10/B)        and
acknowledgment receipt (Ex. PW-10/C). The result given by
