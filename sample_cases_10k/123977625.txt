    CORAM: HON'BLE MR JUSTICE NAVANITI PRASAD SINGH
                                 And
             HON'BLE JUSTICE SMT NILU AGRAWAL

                                      ORAL JUDGMENT

    (Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE NAVANITI PRASAD SINGH)

    Date: 26-09-2016

                         We have heard the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_19">                         2 The present intra-Court appeal has been preferred by

        the State against the decision of the learned Single Judge dated

        22.02.2010 passed in CWJC No 963 of 2010 (Uttam Kumar -Versus-

        State of Bihar &amp; Others) and analogous case. The writ petition was

        allowed by the learned Single Judge following the judgment passed

        by another Single Bench presided by the same learned Judge being

        CWJC No 128 of 2008 (Raj Mohan Sah &amp; Another -Versus- State of

        Bihar &amp; Others). In the case of Raj Mohan Sah (supra), which was

        also a case of the same cadre, the learned Single Judge held that those

        writ petitioners were recruited through Bihar Public Service

        Commission (for brevity BPSC) after undergoing complete selection

        process pursuant to Third Graduate Combined Entrance Examination

        (Advertisement No 1 of 1990). Those appointments were made in the

        year, 2004. The learned Single Judge has noticed that though the

        posts were permanent posts with perennial requirement, they were

        appointed as Statistical Assistant but on contractual basis. This was
 Patna High Court LPA No.129 of 2011 dt.26-09-2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          3/5</span>




        so because, as a matter of fact, it was found that notwithstanding the

        posts being permanent with perennial requirement, requisition was

        made for contractual appointments.          The learned Single Judge,

        accordingly, held that the appointments would be deemed to be

        permanent appointments made in regular post with effect from the

        date they were appointed on contract. Following this decision in the

        case of Raj Mohan Sah (supra), the writ petition filed by the present

        writ petitioners/respondents was allowed. Let it be noted that in this

        case, initially as per Advertisement No 1 of 1990, there was a

        requisition for 75 candidates out of which in fact only 37 were

        appointed and that too on 08.11.2004. For the remaining posts, there

        was again a requisition but this time the requisition was made in the

        year, 2006 and ultimately the appointments were made in the year,

        2009 which included these petitioners/respondents and initially this

        was again on contract basis which, as per judgment of learned Single

        Judge, ought to be treated as a permanent appointment.

</p><p id="p_20">                         3 State, being aggrieved, filed this intra-Court appeal.

        State pointed out that against the judgment of the learned Single

        Judge, in the case of Raj Mohan Sah (supra), it had preferred an

        appeal that is, LPA No 630 of 2010 and LPA No 1469 of 2010 which

        were both allowed on 19.07.2011 upsetting the judgment of the

        learned Single Judge, thus, reversing the judgment of the learned

        Single Judge in Raj Mohan Sah's case. State pleads that following
 Patna High Court LPA No.129 of 2011 dt.26-09-2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                          4/5</span>




        the said Division Bench, we must also allow this Letters Patent

        Appeal and take away the benefit of being made regular employee to

        the writ petitioners/respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_21">                         4    We have examined the judgment in the case of

        Division Bench of this Court in LPA No 630 of 2010 (State of Bihar &amp;

        Others -Versus- Raj Mohan Sah &amp; Others) and analogous appeal. In

        our view, the said judgment of Division Bench would support the writ

        petitioners rather than the State-appellant though technically it has

        overruled the learned Single Judge and reversed the benefit given by

        the learned Single Judge. The said judgment itself points out that if

        the writ petitioners were to be treated by the State to be appointed on

        permanent post then the judgment of the learned Single Judge would

        operate, meaning thereby their selection, though being on contractual

        basis, their appointments would be deemed to be on regular

        permanent basis. Therefore, in principle, what the Division Bench

        said was that if the decision was for permanent regular appointments,

        then though they were shown to be contractual appointees, they would

        be treated as regular permanent appointees. But if the posts were for

        contractual appointees only, the post being temporary, they could not

        be permanent employees on temporary post. Both the propositions, to

        us, appear to be correct and, therefore, what would be relevant is to

        see which of the two consequences applied to the facts of the present

        case. We need not go far, for a supplementary counter affidavit has
            Patna High Court LPA No.129 of 2011 dt.26-09-2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                     5/5</span>




                   been filed by the respondents in the appeal that is the writ petitioners

                   bringing on record the Resolution of the State Government (Annexure

                   A) dated 10.02.2015 circulated under Memo No 715 dated 12.02.2015

                   whereby it has accepted the position that the posts were permanent

                   posts and wrongly requisitions were made for contractual appointees

                   on the said post. Accordingly, the State has resolved to treat all such

                   contractual appointees like the writ petitioners/respondents as

                   permanent appointees after due selection by the BPSC from the date

                   they were initially appointed. State does not contest this position.

                   The result would be that out of the two cases, as shown by the

                   Division Bench earlier, the State now having treated the post to be

                   permanent and the appointments also to be permanent appointments,

                   the second course would apply and, accordingly, the judgment of the

                   learned Single Judge would consequently hold the field. Thus, in

                   substance, the appeal technically by the State would not be entertained

                   and the judgment of the learned Single Judge has to be upheld.

</p><p id="p_22">                                    5 Consequently, the appeal preferred by the State, would

                   stand dismissed.
