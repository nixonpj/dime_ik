Jabalpur, Dated : 31-10-2017
Shri Mahendra Choubey, learned counsel for the applicant.
Shri Y.D.Yadav, learned GA for the respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">This is the first application under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> of Cr.P.C for grant of
bail to the applicant in connection with Crime No. 131/2017
registered at Police Station Bandri District Sagar for offence under
<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Sections 302</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_3">323</a>, <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_4">201</a>, <a href="/doc/1274033/" id="a_5">194</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_6">34</a> of IPC.
</p><p id="p_2">According to the case of the prosecution, the applicant herein along
with the co-accused persons is stated to have caused the death of the
deceased Udham Yadav. The incident relates to 23-06-2017 and the
deceased died on 24-06-2017 and the post mortem was also
conducted on 24-06-2017. There are three injured eye-witnesses in
this case, who states that they have seen the assault on the deceased
and they tried to intercede, in which they were also injured. These
three witnesses are Mahendra, Ramu and Harna and their statements
were recorded on 26-06-2017, three days after the incident and no
reason has been given for the delay in recording the statement. The
applicant has been named in the FIR by the wife of the deceased, who
was the hearsay witness. The port-mortem report clearly shows that
but, for two injuries caused on the leg of the deceased, which
resulted in external bleeding, all the other injuries are minor in
nature being contusions or abrasions. The viscera report of the
deceased shows that he had consumed ethyl alcohol. Learned counsel
for the applicant has also submitted that had the deceased been
taken for medical treatment immediately, he might have survived and
 that his condition worsened on account of being held up in police
station, which caused an inordinate delay in treatment of the
deceased.
</p><p id="p_3">Looking at the facts and circumstances of the case and that but, for
the two injuries, which are caused on the non-vital part of the body
resulting in hemorrhage and that the fact that all the other injuries
are minor in nature and the fact that the applicant is in judicial
custody since 25-06-2017 and that the charge-sheet having been
filed, I am inclined to allow the application and direct that the
applicant herein be enlarged on bail upon his furnishing a personal
bond in the sum of Rs. 50,000/- ( Rupees Fifty Thousand ) with a
solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court.
C.C as per rules.
