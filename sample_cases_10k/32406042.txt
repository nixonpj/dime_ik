        possession  of  one button actuated knife  without  any valid 

        license   in   contravention   of   the   notification   of   Delhi 

        administration. Accordingly, a case vide FIR No.  155/09 for 

        offence   u/s   25/54/59   <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_2">Arms   Act</a>   was   registered   with   PS 

        Jaitpur, New Delhi against accused Sheru.

</blockquote><p id="p_4">    2. After   the   completion   of   investigation,   charge   sheet   for 

        offence   u/s   25/54/59   <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_3">Arms   Act</a>   was   filed   against   the 

        accused. Cognizance of the offence was taken. After supply 

        of   the   copies   to   the   accused,   charge   for   the   offence   u/s 

        25/54/59 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_4">Arms Act</a> was framed against accused Sheru which 

        was   read   over   and   explained   to   the   accused   to   which   he 

        pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
</p>
<p id="p_5">    3. Prosecution   in   order   to   prove   its   case   examined   four 

        prosecution  witnesses.  HC Shiv Charan, duty officer who 

        registered the FIR, has been examined as PW­1. HC Rakesh 

        Kumar and HC Praveen Kumar,   recovery witnesses, have

         been   examined   as   PW­2   and   PW­3   respectively.   IO   SI 

        Sherpal has been examined as PW­4. Prosecution evidence 

        was closed vide order dated 13.05.2013. 

</p><p id="p_6">    4. After   prosecution   evidence,   accused   was   examined   under 

        <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_5">Section   313</a>   Cr.P.C   and   his   statement   was   recorded 

        separately wherein he has denied all incriminating evidence 

        against him and stated that he has been falsely implicated. 

        No defence evidence was led on behalf of accused. 

</p><p id="p_7">    5. Final  arguments were heard on behalf of State as well as 

        defence.
</p>
<p id="p_8">    6. The main arguments of Prosecution are:­ 

        (1)  Sufficient  material  is available on record to prove the 

        guilt   of   accused.   (2)   Contradictions   appearing   in   the 

        testimonies of Prosecution witnesses are minor in nature and 

        don't go to the root of case. (3) Generally Public Persons do 

        not come forward to join in a police case. 

</p><p id="p_9">    7. The main arguments of Defence are:­ (1) The testimonies of 

        Prosecution witnesses are full of contradictions and raising 

        doubts  over the truthfulness of  Prosecution story. (2)Non­

        joining   of   independent   witnesses   despite   their   availability

         also   makes   the   case   of   Prosecution   doubtful.   (3)   Sketch 

        memo   and   seizure   memo   were   prepared   before   sending 

        rukka,   however the said documents bear the FIR  number, 

        which creates doubt over the prosecution case. 

</p><p id="p_10">    8. I have considered the arguments of both side and also gone 

        through   the   entire   record   including   the   testimonies   of 

        witnesses.

<p id="p_11">    9. IO SI Sherpal has deposed that on 26.08.2009, he alongwith 

        HC Pravin Kumar and Ct. Rakesh were checking the vehicle 

        after putting barricades near Yamuna Pushta Road Khadda 

        colony   Jaitpur   vide DD  no. 25 A. At  about  3:15 pm  one 

        motorcycle (black colour pulsar) was coming from the side 

        of   Jaitpur  and   seeing that  police  party  were checking the 

        vehicle,   its   driver   stopped   motorcycle   suddenly   and   was 

        trying to took U turn. On suspicion driver/accused Mohd. 

        Sheru along with motorcycle was apprehended. Thereafter, 

        Mohd.   Sheru   was   checked   and   one   buttondar   knife   was 

        recovered   from   the   right   pocket   of   his   pant.   He/PW­1 

        prepared   sketch   of   the   knife   which   is   Ex.   PW­2/A   and 

        measured the same. Thereafter, he kept the knife in a white

         cloth and prepared a pullana. Pullanda was sealed with the 

        seal   of   SPS.   Pullanda   was   seized   vide   seizure   memo   Ex 

        PW­2/B.   Seal   after   use   was   handed   over   to   HC   Pravin. 

        Thereafter accused Mohd. Sheru was asked to produce the 

        documents   relating   to   the   aforesaid   motorcycle.   On 

        interrogation   he   disclosed   that   aforesaid   motorcycle   has 

        stolen and it was revealed that aforesaid motorcycle was the 

        stolen property of case registered as FIR no. 17/09, PS Modi 

        Nagar and its original number was 4SDJ­7345. Accused has 

        also used the forged number plate. Aforesaid motorcycle was 

        also seized vide memo Ex PW­2/F. Thereafter, he prepared 

        rukka   Ex   PW­4/A   and   present   case   was   got   registered 

        through Ct. Rakesh.

<p id="p_12">    10.IO   has   further   deposed   that   during   the   course   of   the 

        investigation he prepared site plan Ex PW­4/B. He arrested 

        accused   Mohd.   Sheru   vide   memo   Ex   PW­2/C   and   his 

        personal search was carried out vide memo Ex PW­2/D and

         lock   up   after   medical   examination   and   case   property   was 

        deposited in Malkhana.
</p>
<p id="p_13">    11. Ct. Rakesh and HC Praveen have also deposed on the lines 

        of PW­4/IO.
</p>
<p id="p_14">    12.After appreciation of the testimonies of the witnesses as well 

        as   the   material   placed   on   record   by   the   prosecution,   the 

        Court has no hesitation in holding that the prosecution has 

        miserably   failed   to   prove   the   case   against   the     accused 

        beyond reasonable doubt in view of following reasons: 

</p><p id="p_15">    13.No independent/public witness had joined the investigation 

        to witness the recovery, search or other proceedings despite 

        their availability as stated by the witnesses. IO has admitted 

        in his cross­examination that public persons were present at 

        the spot. They were requested to join the proceedings, but 

        none agreed. No notice was served to them on their refusal. 

</p><p id="p_16">    14. The   failure   on   the   part   of   the   prosecution   to   join   public 

        witnesses   especially   when   they   are   available   also   cast   a 

        doubt on the prosecution story. No plausible explanation has 

        come   on   behalf   of   the   prosecution   for   non   joining   of 

        independent   witnesses.   Reference   may   be   made   to   the 


FIR no. 155/09                     State Vs. Mohd. Sheru
PS Jaitpur                                                                     6 of 8

        127 (Delhi HC), NANAK CHAND VS. STATE OF DELHI, 

        1992 Crl. LJ 55 (Delhi HC).
</p>
<p id="p_17">    15.Perusal   of   record   reveals   that   the   sketch   memo   and 

        recovery/seizure memo bears the FIR number although this 

        document was prepared prior to registration of FIR. It has 

        not been explained as to how and under what circumstances, 

        FIR   number   appeared   on   the   sketch   memo   and   recovery 

        memo. This also creates a suspicion regarding the recovery 

        of the alleged knife.
</p>
<p id="p_18">    16.Identity   of   the   knife   is   in   doubt.   The   knife   allegedly 

        recovered from the possession of accused was neither sent 

        for chemical analysis nor fingerprints were lifted from the 

        knife for the purpose of comparison by the expert.

</p><p id="p_19">    17. No efforts were made to handover the seal to independent 

        public persons after use and seals remained with the junior 

        police official  only. Since the handing over of the seal to 

        public witness has not been proved and hence it cannot be 

        ruled out that police had the opportunity to tamper with the

PS Jaitpur                                                                7 of 8
         case property as the seals were in their possession. This also 

        creates a doubt upon the prosecution story. Reference may 

        be made to the judgment titled as "Prem Singh Vs. State" 

        reported as 1996 CRI. L. J/ 3604 in this respect.

</p><p id="p_20">    18.In view of foregoing discussions, this Court is of the view 

        that prosecution has failed to bring such material on record 

        which   would   have   gone   to   establish   the   guilt   of   accused 

        beyond reasonable doubt holding him guilty for the offence 

        under <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_6">section 25</a> Arms Act. Hence, accused is acquitted of 

        the charges for offence under <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_7">section 25</a> Arms Act.
