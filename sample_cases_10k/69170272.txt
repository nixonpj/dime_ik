                                JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.     Through the instant petition filed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 561-A</a> of the Code of

       Criminal Procedure (hereinafter for short, <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_2">Cr.P.C</a>), petitioners seek

       quashment of the complaint under Sections 12 and 23 of J&amp;K

       Protection of Women from <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_3">Domestic Violence Act</a>, titled "<a href="/doc/161892787/" id="a_4">Vandana

       Choudhary vs. Rakesh Choudhary and ors</a>., pending in the court of

       Munsiff, Samba. Petitioners also seek quashment of ex-parte order

       dated 29.08.2017 passed by the said Court in the complaint, by virtue

       of which the trial court has directed petitioner No.1 to pay/provide

       Rs.3,000/- as monthly interim maintenance allowances to the

       respondent from the date of passing of the order.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.     The case of the petitioners is that marriage of petitioner No.1 with the

       respondent was solemnised on 25.02.2004 at Vijayupr, District

       Samba, according to Hindu Rites &amp; Customs and out of the said

       wedlock, one daughter, namely, Shriya Choudhary and one son,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      2                      CRMC No.226/2018</span>




     namely Udhey Choudhary were born, who are putting up with the

     petitioners. It is stated that respondent has left her matrimonial house

     without any reason, cause or excuse and is living in her parental house

     and has deserted/abandoned the petitioner No.1 as well as her children

     and is continuously living with her parents since 5 th August, 2015.

     The petitioner No.1 filed a divorce petition against the respondent,

     which is pending in the court of Additional District, Judge

     (Matrimonial Cases) Jammu since September, 2015 and in the said

     divorce petition, the respondent appeared and also filed the objections,

     but in the meanwhile, the respondent filed the complaint/application

     under Sections 12 and 23 of J&amp;K Protection of Women from

     <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_5">Domestic Violence Act</a>, 2010 against the petitioners before the court

     of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Samba. It is further stated that on

     29.08.2017 the said complaint was transferred to the court of Munsiff

     Magistrate First Class, Samba and the learned Magistrate without

     summoning the petitioners, passed the impugned order dated

     29.08.2017, thereby directing the petitioner No.1 to pay Rs. 3000/- per

     month as interim maintenance allowance to the respondent from the

     date of passing of the said order.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.   The petitioners seek quashment of the complaint under Sections 12

     and 23 of J&amp;K Protection of Women from, <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_6">Domestic Violence Act</a>,

     titled "<a href="/doc/161892787/" id="a_7">Vandana Choudhary vs. Rakesh Choudhary and ors</a>., pending

     in the court of Munsiff, Samba and also the ex-parte order dated

     29.08.2017 on the following grounds:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">               "That the impugned order dated 29.08.2017 is against the facts
               and law and is liable to be set aside;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">               That the respondent is continuously living with her parents since
               5th August, 2015 and she even has abandoned her minor children
               who are putting up with the petitioners;

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">              That from the perusal of the aforesaid complaint/application
              under Sections 12 and 23 of the Act, no relief u/s 23 of the Act, has
              been sought by the respondent, but the court below without
              considering the contents of the complaint as well as the provisions
              and rules of the Act passed the ex-parte impugned order against
              the petitioner No. 1;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">              That the respondent has not placed any material on record on the
              basis of which h the trial court could have observed its prima facie
              satisfaction regarding commission of any act of domestic violence,
              as such under said circumstances even the main
              complaint/application filed by respondent is not maintainable and
              is liable to be dismissed;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">              That admittedly the respondent is living separately from the
              petitioners since August, 2015 and has filed the aforesaid
              complaint in the month of August, 2017, so how could the
              petitioner allegedly commit act of domestic violence upon the
              respondent when the respondent already has been living in her
              parental house;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">              that there is no mention of any act of domestic violence in the
              complaint filed by the complainant, moreover neither the
              protection officer submitted any report of domestic incident to the
              Magistrate on behalf of aggrieved person nor the Magistrate
              received any domestic incident report from the protection Officer,
              but the trial court in absence of any incident regarding domestic
              violence passed the ex-parte impugned order which on the fact of
              it is contrary to the provisions and rules of the Act;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">              that the trial court has not issued any summon or afforded any
              opportunity of being heard to the petitioners before passing the
              impugned order, therefore, the impugned order is passed in
              violation of Principle of Natural Justice, as such is required to be
              quashed;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">               that the respondent has neither sought any relief under <a href="/doc/1933289/" id="a_8">Section 23</a>
              of the Protection of Women from <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_9">Domestic Violence Act</a>, nor the
              respondent filed the affidavit to seek any interim relief of
              maintenance in terms of <a href="/doc/207919/" id="a_10">Section 23</a> of the Act, therefore, the
              impugned order passed by the trial court is illegal, unwarranted
              under law and without jurisdiction and the same is required to be
              quashed."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">4.   I have heard the rival contentions of parties. Counsel for petitioner has

     reiterated all grounds taken in petition and also argued that there was

     no report of protection officer before taking cognizance. In support of

     his contention, learned counsel for the petitioners relied upon the

     judgments of this Court reported in 2014(4) JKJ 347 case titled

     <a href="/doc/12984986/" id="a_11">Vinay Sharma and ors. vs. Shweta Sharma and ors</a>.; and 2014

     Manhas</a>. Learned counsel for the respondent has supported the order

     impugned and stated that petitioners have raised factual aspects,

     which cannot be considered in this petition.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.   I have given my thoughtful consideration to whole aspects of the

     matter.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.   The operative part of order dated 29.08.2017, passed by JMIC

     (Munsiff), Samba reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">               "On the basis of the affidavit furnished by the aggrieved person
               and the statement recorded by this Court, this court has a reason
               to believe that the aggrieved person has come to the court with the
               terms of a „wife‟ of respondent No. 1, namely, Rakesh Choudhary.
               She is the victim of physical/mental torture on the part of
               respondents. Admittedly, at present she is not living with the
               respondents, but it would not rightful to say that she is not being
               subjected to mental torture by respondents especially respondent
               No. 1 on account of the fact that she being the wife of respondent
               No. 1 has been neglected/deserted and thrown out by the
               respondents without any source of survival. She can be said to be
               under constant emotional/mental distress due to maltreatment
               caused to her by the respondents. Respondent No. 1 cannot escape
               easily from his liability of taking care of his wife, but it is very
               unfortunate as stated by the aggrieved person, the respondent No.
               1 has forgotten his obligation of taking care of his wife (aggrieved
               person).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">                   Aggrieved person has disclosed that she is not doing any work,
               having no independent source of income, so being a woman,
               without any sufficient source of income, victim of disloyalty of her
               life partner de serves to be prevented of being put to starvation
               and social exploitation for want of daily basic requirement of life
               for her survival.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                   Hence, for the reasons stated herein above and without
               adverting upon the merits of the case, ex-parte interim relief is
               desired to be granted in favour of the aggrieved person.
                   As the respondent No. 1 is prima-facie found to have
               committed cruelty and caused the aggrieved person to suffer
               physical, mental injury and emotional distress and made her to
               come to the court which is the last resort for the aggrieved person
               for redressal of her grievances, as such, respondent No.1 is
               directed to provide Rs. 3000/- as monthly maintenance allowance,
               to the applicant/petitioner from the date of passing of this order.
               For further proceedings file put up on 15.09.2017"

<p id="p_7">7.   The first and foremost argument of counsel for petitioners, in brief, is

     that there is no report of Protection Officer, so complaint/petition

     before Court below is not maintainable;

     person. Under <a href="/doc/1373165/" id="a_24">Section 12</a> of the DV Act, an application has to be

     presented by an aggrieved person, either by the person herself or a

     Protection Officer or any other person on behalf of the aggrieved

     person to the Magistrate, seeking relief as provided under the <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_25">DV Act</a>.

     A proviso has been added to <a href="/doc/1067476/" id="a_26">Section 12(1)</a> of the Act, that before

     passing any such order on any application received, the Magistrate

     shall take into consideration any domestic incident report received by

     him from the Protection Officer or the Service Provider. <a href="/doc/711689/" id="a_27">Section 9</a> of

     the DV Act entails the duties and functions of a Protection Officer,

     whose primary duty is to assist the Magistrate in the discharge of his

     functions under the Act, to make a domestic incident report to the

     Magistrate in the form prescribed, upon receipt of a complaint of

     domestic violence, while forwarding copies of the complaint to the

     Police Officer in charge of the Police Station within the local limits of

     whose jurisdiction, domestic violence is alleged to have been

     committed, as well as to the Service Provider. <a href="/doc/378538/" id="a_28">Section 9(2)</a> of the DV

     Act further provides that the Protection Officer shall be under the

     control and supervision of the Magistrate and shall perform the duties

     imposed on him by the Magistrate and the Government.

     Moreover, <a href="/doc/921557/" id="a_29">Section 4</a> of the DV Act provides that any person, who has

     reasons to believe that an act of domestic violence has been, or is

     being, or is likely to be committed, may give information about it to

     the concerned Protection Officer.

</p><p id="p_13">10.   On a conjoint reading of <a href="/doc/711689/" id="a_30">Sections 9</a> and <a href="/doc/1373165/" id="a_31">12</a> of the DV Act, it is

      manifestly clear that it is duty of the Protection Officer to work under

      the control and supervision of the Magistrate and to perform duties

      imposed upon him by the Magistrate and in case, he has received a

      complaint on domestic violence, then to make a domestic incident

      report and submit it to the Magistrate, as well as to forward copies of

      the complaint to the Police Officer in charge of the police station

      within local limits of whose jurisdiction, domestic violence is alleged

      to have been committed. The proviso added to <a href="/doc/1067476/" id="a_32">Section 12(1)</a> of the

      DV Act is only to the effect that in case a domestic incident report has

      been received by the Magistrate, the same shall be considered before

      passing any order on an application received. <a href="/doc/1373165/" id="a_33">Section 12</a> of the DV

      Act per se does not hold that a Magistrate on receipt of complaint is

      obligated to call for a domestic incident report, before passing any

      order on an application. So it is not mandatory for a Magistrate to

      obtain a domestic incident report before the Magistrate passes any

      order provided under various sections of the Act; so receipt of

      domestic incident report is not a pre-requisite for issuing notice to the

      respondent. Magistrate, on the basis of an application supported by

      affidavit, on being satisfied can even grant ex parte orders in favour of

      the aggrieved person under <a href="/doc/1860699/" id="a_34">Sections 18</a>, <a href="/doc/1130386/" id="a_35">19</a>, <a href="/doc/485875/" id="a_36">20</a>, <a href="/doc/363610/" id="a_37">21</a> or 22 of the <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_38">DV

      Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">11.   As already discussed above, proviso to <a href="/doc/1067476/" id="a_39">Section 12(1)</a> only stipulates

      that the Magistrate shall take into consideration any domestic incident

      report received by him from the Protection Officer or the service

      provider. <a href="/doc/1067476/" id="a_40">Section 12(1)</a> does not directly stipulate that a report 'shall'

      be called for, before any relief can be granted.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">12.   So argument of counsel for petitioners that report of protection officer

      is sine qua non for issuing process in petition under <a href="/doc/1373165/" id="a_41">section 12</a> of Act,

      is not maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">13.   Another argument of counsel for petitioners is that court cannot grant

      exparte order under <a href="/doc/207919/" id="a_42">section 23</a> of Act thereby granting monetary relief

      under <a href="/doc/485875/" id="a_43">section 20</a> of Act. This argument is without any basis. <a href="/doc/1933289/" id="a_44">Section
