Date

ORAL JUDGMENT</pre> 

 


 


 
	  

<p id="p_1">The
	applicant   Radheshyam Developers has taken out this Judges'
	Summons seeking direction to the Official Liquidator to sign the
	E-Dhara Form in respect of land bearing Survey Nos.358/1+2, 361/1/A,
	350/1, 350/2, 351 and 352 situated at village Karamsad, Anand
	Sojitra Road, Vithal Udhyognagar showing the correct name of the
	Company in liquidation being Shree Vallabh Glass Works Limited (in
	Liquidation) in respect of which the sale has been confirmed in
	favour of the applicant by oral judgment dated 17.01.2007 passed in
	Official Liquidator Report No.157 of 2006.  The applicant has also
	prayed for the direction to the respondent No.2 to take appropriate
	steps for removing the endorsement of charge in the revenue records
	in respect of the subject property owned by the applicant and/or any
	other suitable directions for removing the endorsement of respondent
	No.2 in the revenue records pertaining to the subject property.  The
	applicant has further prayed for direction to the Official
	Liquidator to inform the revenue authorities for removal of any
	other name from the revenue records in respect of the subject
	properties and further to direct him that only the name of the
	Company in liquidation and now in the name of the purchaser be
	recorded in the revenue records against the subject properties.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_2">An
	affidavit in support of the Judges' Summons is filed by one Mr.
	Shyamlal Shah, the partner of the applicant Firm.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_3">Mr.
</p><p id="p_4">	N. K. Pahwa, learned advocate appearing for the applicant has
	submitted that the property in question was purchased by the
	applicant and sale deed was executed.  However, there was a charge
	of the respondent No.2 Bank, namely, Nadiad Mercantile Cooperative
	Bank Limited, registered on the subject properties.  He has further
	submitted that the applicant has purchased the properties free from
	all encumbrances or the charges over the subject properties and
	hence, no sooner the property was purchased by the applicant, the
	charge attached with the subject properties should immediately be
	removed.  Since the said charge was not removed, the applicant has
	to file the present application seeking appropriate direction before
	this Court.  He has further submitted that this issue was already
	concluded by this Court vide order dated 06.10.2008 passed in
	Company Application No.433 of 2008.   It is in respect of the
	properties belonging to the same Company in liquidation.  The Court
	while disposing of the said application, observed that the dues of
	the Bank are pertaining to the pre-liquidation period and hence, the
	Court directed the respondent Nos.2 &amp; 3 in that case to intimate
	to the revenue authorities to remove their attachment over the
	properties as the dues are pertaining to the pre-liquidation period.
	 Even in that case, the decision of this Court eralier rendered in
	Company Application No.554 of 2007 and other cognate matters dated
	15.05.2008 was relied upon.  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_5">Mr.
</p><p id="p_6">	Pahwa further relied on the decision of this Court in the case of
	Sarthak Industries Limited  V/s. Official Liquidator of Shree
	Vallabh Glass Works Limited (Company in liquidation) passed in
	Company Application No.395 of 2008 decided on 06.10.2008 wherein
	the attachment on the property purchased by the purchaser was
	ordered to be removed.  The Court has also observed in that case
	that if the dues of the Company in liquidation are pertaining to the
	period of pre-liquidation, the auction purchasers are not liable to
	discharge the same.  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_7">Based
	on the aforesaid judgments and legal position, Mr. Pahwa has
	submitted that the attachment on the properties purchased by the
	applicant is required to be removed and for that purpose, necessary
	directions be issued to the revenue authorities.  He has further
	submitted that after confirmation of sale and before the sale deed
	is executed, it has been brought to the notice of the applicant that
	there was change in the survey numbers of certain properties
	purchased by the applicant and hence, as per the order passed by
	this Court on 22.03.2010, the applicant has filed further affidavit
	showing the correct survey numbers.  He has, therefore, submitted
	that the charge of the respondent No.2 Bank on the subject
	properties be directed to be removed.  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_8">The
	Official Liquidator has filed his report on 21.12.2009.  Ms. Amee
	Yajnik, learned advocate appearing for the Official Liquidator has
	submitted that since this Court vide its order dated 06.10.2008
	passed in Company Application No.395 of 2008 observed that the
	purchaser is not liable to the dues of pre-liquidation period, the
	prayer made by the applicant is required to be granted.  It appears
	from the report filed by the Official Liquidator and submissions
	made by Ms. Yajnik that due to the decision already taken by this
	Court in earlier matters and since that has become final, the
	Official Liquidator has no other alternative but to take necessary
	consequential steps for the purpose of removal of attachment of the
	properties purchased by the applicant through Court auction.  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_9">Mr.
</p><p id="p_10">	S. S. Panesar, learned advocate appearing with Mr.  Y.H. Vyas for
	the respondent No.2 Bank has submitted that this Court has no
	jurisdiction to entertain this application.  The applicant will have
	to approach the Board of Nominees as pursuant to the order passed by
	the Board of Nominees, the attachment was levied on the properties
	and hence, the Court should not grant any relief prayed for in this
	application.    
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_11">Having
	heard learned advocates appearing for the parties and having
	considered their rival submissions in light of the affidavits and
	counter affidavits as well as the report of the Official Liquidator,
	the Court is of the view that the applicant is quite justified in
	making the prayer for removal of the attachment on the properties
	purchased by the applicant. The Court has already discussed this
	issue at great length in Company Application No.554 of 2007 decided
	on 15.05.2008.  For the reasons recorded in that case and subsequent
	decisions, the Court sees no reason not to grant the reliefs prayed
	for in the present application.  It is, however, made clear that
	whatever attachment of the respondent No.2 Bank is there on the
	properties purchased by the applicant, the same shall be removed
	forthwith.  The Court is not going into the details of the Survey
	Numbers which are subsequently changed.  However, the same shall be
	considered by the Revenue Authorities while removing the attachment
	of the respondent No.2 Bank.  In any case, it is to be seen that
	exact area purchased by the applicant shall remain the same and even
	if the survey numbers are changed, the area should not exceed.  If
	the Bank is having its attachment on other properties which are not
	purchased by the applicant, this order would not compel the Revenue
	authorities to remove the attachment.    
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_12">Subject
	to the above observations and directions, this application is
	accordingly allowed and the Official Liquidator is directed to take
	necessary consequential steps as indicated above.  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_13">This
	application is accordingly disposed of. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_14">At
	this stage, request is made by Mr. S.S. Panesar for stay of this
	order.  Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, it is
	rejected.
