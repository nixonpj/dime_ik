Item No. 46
Court No. 14
    ac
                                               F.M.A. 309 of 2012
                                               (CAN 2939 of 2015)
                                               (CAN 1939 of 2015)

                                            Gobardhan Chattopadhyay
                                                     -versus-
                                            Jugal Prosad Yadav &amp; Ors.


                           Mr. Amitava Mukherjee,
                           Ms. Arpita Saha.
                                 ... For the Petitioner/Appellant.

                           Mr. Probal Kumar Mukherjee,
                           Ms. Shebatee Datta.
                                 ... For the Respondents.</pre>


<p id="p_1">                           Re : CAN 2939 of 2015,
                                CAN 1939 of 2015.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                            The   present   application    has   been   taken   out   for
               restoration of this appeal, which was dismissed for default on 13th
               March, 2014. Since the application for restoration was not filed within
               the prescribed period of limitation, the appellant has filed an
               application for condonation of delay.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                            It is alleged by the petitioner that the instant appeal was
               admitted for hearing by the Division Bench, presided over by Justice
               Pinaki Chandra Ghose, as His Lordship then was, on 16th March,
               2012.   Subsequently, the said appeal was again listed for hearing
               under the heading Order 41 Rule 11 matter on 13th March, 2014
               before the other Division Bench of this Court, presided over by Justice
               Banerjee, as his Lordship then was.        Since the appeal had already
               been admitted, the learned lawyer of the appellant missed the said
               item in the list as it was not expected to be listed under the heading
               hearing of Order 41 Rule 11 matter on that date. As a result, the
               appellant was not represented before their Lordship on 13th March,
               2014 resulting dismissing of the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                            It is further alleged that the appellant was completely
               unaware of such order of dismissal of the appeal till 9th December,
               2014 and it is only when the lawyer's clerk went in the concerned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>




department for taking steps in connection with the said appeal, he
came to know that the appeal stood dismissed on 13th March, 2014.
Thereafter, the present application for restoration as well as the
application for condonation of delay were filed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             After considering the explanation given by the appellant
for the reasons for his default in appearance before the Court on 13th
March, 2014; we are of the view that the reason which prevented the
appellant from appearing before the Court on the said date has been
sufficiently explained by the appellant in this application. The delay
in filing this application has also been sufficiently explained by the
appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             Accordingly, we restore the appeal and readmit the same
after condonation of delay.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             Both the applications being CAN 2939 of 2015 and CAN
1939 of 2015 are allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             Let the lower court records be called for by special
messenger at the cost of the appellant. Such cost should be put in
within a week from date.
</p>
<p id="p_9">             The concerned department is directed to examine the
lower court records immediately on its arrival and serve notice of
arrival of lower court records upon the learned advocate-on-record of
the appellant immediately after the records are found complete on
such examination.
</p>
<p id="p_10">             The appellant is directed to file requisite number of
informal paper books in the concerned department within eight weeks
from the date of service of notice of arrival of lower court record upon
the learned advocate-on-record of the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_11">             Since the respondent no. 1 is represen-ted by his learned
advocate, service of notice of appeal upon the respondent no. 1 is
dispensed with.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>




<p id="p_12">            The appellant is directed to put in the requisite for
service of notice of appeal upon the remaining respondents within a
week.
</p>
