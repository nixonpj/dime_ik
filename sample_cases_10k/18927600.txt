<p id="p_1">[Order of the Court was made by C.T.SELVAM, J.]

	Challenge is made to the order of detention passed by the second respondent vide Proceedings in C3/D.O./30/2018 dated 30.05.2018, whereby the detenu, by name, Sathish, son of Natarajan, aged about 36 years, was ordered to be detained under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Drug Offenders, Forest Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders, Sand Offenders, Slum-grabbers and Video Pirates Act, 1982 <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_2">(Tamil Nadu Act</a> 14 of  1982) branding him as a "GOONDA".
</p><p id="p_2">	2. The detenu has come to adverse notice in the following cases:-
</p><p id="p_3">S.No
Cr.No. &amp; Police Station
Offences
</p><p id="p_4">1.
Cr.No.62/2009
Cuddalore Port P.S.
294, 323, 324 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>
</p><p id="p_5">2.
Cr.No.36/2018
Cuddalore Port P.S.
147, 148, 294(b), 323, 324, 307 and 302 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>
The ground case has been registered against the detenu in Cr.No.329 of 2018 on the file of Inspector of Police, Cuddalore Old Town Police Station, for offences u/s 392, 353 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a>.  The detention order has been passed by second respondent in C3/D.O./30/2018.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	3. Though many grounds have been raised in the petition, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, confines his argument only in respect of non-application of mind on the part of the detaining authority in passing the order of detention.  
</p>
<p id="p_7">	4. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the detenu was arrested in the ground case in Cr.No.329/2018 on 19.05.2018; whereas the detention order was passed on 30.05.2018, i.e. Nearly after a lapse of 11 days.  This inordinate delay in passing of detention order would vitiate the same. Further, the Grounds of Detention would reveal that 2 adverse cases have been registered against the detenu and a ground case was registered against him in Cr.No.329 of 2018 for offences u/s 392 and 353 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>.   Admittedly, the detenu has not moved any bail applications in the ground case.  Therefore, the likelihood of coming out on bail is very remote ; whereas the statement of the Sponsoring Authority has been taken into consideration by the Detaining Authority that the relatives of the detenu are taking steps to file bail applications in the ground case.  When a bail application has not been moved, the logical conclusion would be that there is no likelihood of coming out on bail.  Therefore, we are of the view that the finding of the Detaining Authority that there is likelihood of the detenu coming out on bail, is nothing but a clear non-application of mind and the Detaining Authority has not passed the order on merits ; but passed, based on mere ipsi dixit.  Hence, we are of the view that the detention order is liable to be set aside.

The detenu, namely, Sathish, son of  Natarajan, aged about 36 years, is directed to be released forthwith unless his detention is required in connection with any other case.
