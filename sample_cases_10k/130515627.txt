<p id="p_1">3.   01.08.2014                       Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and

                  learned A.P.P. for the State.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                      The petitioner seeks bail in Buxar (T) P.S. Case

                  No. 353 of 2013 dated 04.09.2013 instituted under <a href="/doc/886598/" id="a_1">Section

                  365</a> of the Indian Penal Code.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                                      Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that

                  only on the basis of the allegation made in the F.I.R., he has

                  been made an accused without there being any direct link of

                  the petitioner in the disappearance of the son of the informant.

                  It is submitted that the brother-in-law (Sala) of the informant

                  is the main link between the informant and the demand and

                  later payment of Rs. 2,00,000/- by way of ransom and also the

                  petitioner who is alleged to have assured that the son of the

                  informant would be returned. It is further submitted that

                  during investigation nothing incriminating has come and also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.13065 of 2014 (3) dt.01-08-2014</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           2/3</span>




             that the mobile phone from which the ransom call was made is

             not in the name of the petitioner.                Learned counsel further

             submits that though as per the allegation, the son of the

             informant went missing on 09.06.2013 but F.I.R. had been

             lodged on 04.09.2013 and the gap of almost three months is

             not convincingly explained. Learned counsel further submits

             that even with regard to the allegation that the wife of the

             person missing i.e., the daughter-in-law of the informant who

             is alleged to have relations with many other persons, it has not

             come that the petitioner was also one among them and thus

             the allegation itself is far fetched and false. Learned counsel

             submits that a co-accused namely, Sunil Kumar @ Sunil

             Kumar Yadav, who has been made an accused on the basis of

             his confessional statement, has been granted bail by a co-

             ordinate Bench of this Court on 13.05.2014 in Cr. Misc. No.

             7084 of 2014. It is submitted that the petitioner has been

             remanded in the present case on 16.12.2013.

</p><p id="p_4">                                  Learned A.P.P., upon going through the case

             diary, does not dispute the fact that nothing incriminating has

             come against the petitioner during trial and only there is

             suspicion.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                                  Considering the facts and circumstances of the

             case and submissions of learned counsel for the parties, let the

             petitioner be released on bail on furnishing bail bonds of Rs.

             10,000/- (ten thousand) with two sureties of the like amount
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">       Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.13065 of 2014 (3) dt.01-08-2014</span>

                   each to the satisfaction of the learned A.D.J.- IInd, Buxar in

                   Buxar (T) P.S. Case No. 353 of 2013. The petitioner shall

                   cooperate in the trial and be present before the Court on each

                   and every date. Failure to do so on two consecutive dates,

                   without sufficient cause, shall lead to cancellation of his bail

                   bonds.</p><pre id="pre_2">
