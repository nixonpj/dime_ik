after   going   through      medical     records,   duration   of

treatment, follow up treatment for head injury, I award

a sum of Rs.75,000/- towards 'medical expenditure'

(present).   Considering the         nature   of    injuries and

consequent pain and suffering, impact of injuries on

education of claimant, I award a sum of Rs.50,000/-

aged about 24 years at the time of accident. He had

completed Bachelor degree in Business Administration

in first class - distinction.        He was aspiring to get

</p>
<p id="p_26">
admission    to    Master's      Degree    in    Business

Administration by securing a seat through C.E.T

examination. It was impeded by injuries suffered in the

accident. Therefore, I award a sum of Rs.1.00 lakh

towards 'loss of education'. The claimant has to bear

with permanent physical disability during the rest of his

life. Therefore, a sum of Rs.40,000/- is awarded under

the head 'loss of amenities and enjoyment of life". The

claimant had suffered head injuries, he is likely to face

complications. Therefore, it is necessary to make some

provision for 'future medical expenditure'. A sum of

Rs.20,000/- is awarded under the head 'future medical

expenditure'. The claimant had frequent visits to

hospital and he was taken care of by an attendant

during hospitalization. Therefore, a sum of Rs.15,000/-

is awarded under the head 'conveyance and food and

attendant charges. Thus, claimant is entitled to total

compensation of Rs.3,00,000/-.

     The appeal is accepted in part. The impugned

interest, period of accrual of interest and ratio of

payment and investment is confirmed.
