          learned   counsel   is   appearing   for   the 

          acquiring   body   and   Shri   A.M.   Phule,   learned 

          AGP is appearing for the State.


</p><p id="p_2">          2.               The lands, which are subject matter 

          in   all   these   Appeals,   were   acquired   for 

          Dongargaon   High   Level   Barrage.   The   Special 

          Land   Acquisition   Officer   had   offered   the 

          compensation   for   the   land   acquired   for   the 

          said   project   at   the   rates   starting   from 

          Rs.2435/-   per   Aar   to   Rs.3565/-   per   Aar   for 

          dry   land   and   double   of   the   said   amount   for 

          irrigated                land.       In       the            Reference 

          Applications,   the   Reference   Court   has 

          determined the market value of the said land 

          at   Rs.13,250/-   per   Aar   for   dry   land   and 

          Rs.26,500/- per Aar for irrigated land.


</p><p id="p_3">          3.               Dissatisfied with the enhancement in 

          the compensation so awarded by the Reference 

          Court,   the   acquiring   body   has   preferred 

          present   First   Appeals.   Since   some   delay   has

          occasioned, the acquiring  body has preferred 

          present   Applications   seeking   condonation   of 

          delay. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">          4.               The delay occasioned is of 740 days 

          in   some   matters   and   maximum   delay   caused   is 

          of   841   days   in   some   matters.   The   time 

          consumed in making  procedural  compliances  is 

          the   main   reason   assigned   by   the   acquiring 

          body for occurrence of delay. 


</p><p id="p_6">          5.               The   learned   counsel   for   the 

          claimants  has strongly  opposed  for condoning 

          delay   stating   that   the   reasons   stated   for 

          occurrence   of   delay   for   such   a   huge   period 

          are   not   cogent.   The   learned   counsel   submits 

          that for lack of sufficient cause provided by 

          the   acquiring   body,   the   applications   be 

          rejected.

          the   submissions   made   by   the   learned   counsel 

          appearing for the respective parties.

</p><p id="p_10">          7.               It is true that the delay caused is 

          of   a   long   period.   However,   the   reasons 

          assigned   by   the   applicants   cannot   be 

          outrightly   rejected.   Though,   the   particulars 

          explaining the delay are not provided in the 

          applications,   it   can   be   understood   that   in 

          obtaining   sanction   from   higher   authorities 

          and   in   seeking   legal   opinion   and   then   for 

          procurement   of   the   Court   fees,   some   time 

          could have been certainly consumed. Moreover, 

          I am more concerned with the submission made 

          by   the   learned   counsel   for   the   applicants 

          that   the   enhancement   in   the   amount   of 

          compensation   is   arbitrary.   As   noted   herein 

          above,   when   the   Special   Land   Acquisition 

          Officer   had   offered   compensation   at   maximum 

          rate   of   Rs.3,920/-   per   Are   and   minimum   rate 

          of Rs.2,435/ per Are, the Reference Court had 

          enhanced   it   to   Rs.13,250/-   per   Are   for   dry 

          land   and   Rs.26,500/-   per   Are   for   irrigated 

          land. In the circumstances, it appears to me 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">::: Uploaded on - 05/10/2018               ::: Downloaded on - 07/10/2018 00:55:56 :::</span>

          that   the   delay   caused   in   filing   the   appeals 

          needs to be condoned. It cannot be forgotten 

          that   public   money   is   involved   in   these 

          matters. In the circumstances, in the larger 

          interest   I   am   inclined   to   condone   the   delay 

          so that the objections raised in the Appeals 

          can be heard on their  own merits.  Hence  the 

          following order:
