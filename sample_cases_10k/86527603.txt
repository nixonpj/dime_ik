<p id="p_1">1.             The petitioner, Gurnam Singh was a Constable with
Border Security Force. He was attached to the 105th Bn. which
was detailed for duties at Murshidabad in the State of West
Bengal.
</p><p id="p_2">2.             On 12.1.2009 a civilian named Kartik Mondal,
lodged a complaint with the Commandant of the Battalion
against the petitioner alleging that on 5th January 2009, the
petitioner approached him at his shop and abused and
threatened to kill him and his son if he failed to give `35,000/-
to the petitioner. The complaint reads as under:-

        With due respect I beg to state that I am a poor

<p id="p_3">3.             The complaint exhibited during trial as „Ex.L‟ has
been reproduced by us verbatim and hence the grammatical,
syntax and the spelling errors.
</p><p id="p_4">4.             It   is   apparent   that   the   complaint   related   to
extortion and the allegations being serious, required a probe.
A preliminary inquiry was held to investigate the matter.
During the inquiry, with reference to the service book of the
petitioner it was noted that when he joined service, petitioner
gave his residential address to be Village Jounmohr under
jurisdiction of P.S. Ajnala, District Amritsar, Punjab and that
Amrit Mondal had deposited `15,000/- on 4.8.2008 at the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">     W.P.(C) No.8580/2010                                     Page 2 of 18</span>
 Berhampore Branch of the State Bank of India and `14,000/-
on 26.8.2008 with the Jiyaganj Branch of the State Bank of
India      for    being     credited      in     Account     No.10734663685
maintained by the State Bank of India Ajnala Branch, which
account was in the name of one Pradhan Singh. As per Amrit
Mondal petitioner had handed him over `35,000/- requiring
him to deposit the same with any branch of State Bank of India
in Account No.10734663685 so that through the Core Banking
System the money could be credited in the account of Pradhan
Singh but he had deposited, in two instalments, only `29,000/-
and had spent the rest when his wife delivered a baby and
hence the petitioner was wanting `6,000/- to be returned.
</p><p id="p_5">5.               During     preliminary        inquiry,   various   documents
surfaced and which we note were exhibited during the
Summary Security Force Court proceedings.                       In brief, the
documents         were,     a   computer         generated    printout   „Ex.P‟
obtained from the Lalbagh Branch of the State Bank of India
evidencing that account No.10734663685 maintained with the
State Bank of India, Branch Ajnala (Branch Code being
No.1259) was in the name of one Pradhan Singh and that on
4.8.2008, and on 26.8.2008 vide two receipts, „Ex.U‟, a sum of
`15,000/- and `14,000/- was deposited with the State Bank of
India Berhampore Branch and Jiyaganj Branch respectively,
(both in the State of West Bengal) and the money was credited
in account No.10734663685 at Branch Code No.1259 i.e. in the
account of Pradhan Singh at the State Bank of India, Branch
Ajnala. Further documents were, a written statement, sent via
fax by the Assistant Sub-Inspector P.S. Ajnala, purported to be

 of Pradhan Singh acknowledging `29,000/- being credited in
his account No.10734663685 as entered in his passbook;
photocopy whereof was exhibited as „Ex.V‟, which shows the
said two amounts being credited in the account of Pradhan
Singh. Another document, „Ex.S‟ was the statement recorded
by ASI Darshan Singh and as made to him by Pradhan Singh in
Gurmukhi, translated copy being „Ex.S-1‟, as per which
according to Pradhan Singh, Amrit Lal Mondal had returned the
money to him as he had lent `29,000/- to Amrit Lal Mondal,
when he i.e. Pradhan Singh was a transporter and used to
make visits to West Bengal, Assam and Guwahati. It be noted
that as furnished by the petitioner, when he took employment,
his residence was in village Jounsmuher within the jurisdiction
of PS Ajnala.
</p><p id="p_6">6.             It is apparent that the evidence which surfaced
during inquiry was strictly not in conformity with the complaint
of Kartik Mondal, but was that Kartik Mondal‟s son utilized the
Core Banking System of the State Bank of India to deposit
`15,000/- on 4.8.2008 and `14,000/- on 26.8.2008 by using
deposit slips at Berhampore Branch of the State Bank of India
and Jiyaganj Branch of the State Bank of India, which money
was credited in Account No.10734663685 in the name of
Pradhan Singh maintained by the State Bank of India Ajnala
Branch and that the petitioner and Pradhan Singh were
residents of neighbouring villages falling within the jurisdiction
of PS Ajnala and a stated explanation by Pradhan Singh which
required a further probe.      There were traces of petitioner
allegedly acquiring ill gotten wealth and transmitting the same

 to his friend Pradhan Singh. Accordingly, the Commandant of
the Unit took a decision that Record of Evidence be drawn up
and for which the Deputy Commandant of the Battalion was
deputed to do the needful.             The Record of Evidence
proceedings were conducted in the presence of the petitioner
and statements of various persons including Amrit Kumar
Mondal and his father Kartik Mondal were recorded.              The
tentative charge sheet drawn up against the petitioner before
initiating the Recording of Evidence was drawn up as under:-

<p id="p_9">7.             During the proceedings pertaining to Record of
Evidence, 6 witnesses were examined, testimony whereof we
need not note inasmuch as, as would be evident hereinafter,
after considering the Record of Evidence, the Commandant
decided to convene a Summary Security Force Court, where
witnesses deposed and it was this testimony which became
the evidence to be considered in respect to the charge.
</p><p id="p_10">8.             The Record of Evidence was submitted to the
Commandant who decided that in view of the gravity of the
incriminating evidence the matter could not be disposed of in
a summary manner and hence convened the Security Force
Court, and as per the BSF Act, being the Commandant,
functioned as the Court.

petitioner, 4 witnesses were examined by the prosecution and
to refute the charge, 1 witness was examined by the petitioner
in defence.

Ajnala, District Amritsar Punjab
</p><p id="p_14">12.         Amrit Kumar Mondal PW-2, son of Kartik Mondal,
deposed that he had been working with his father who has a
shop at Lalgola near BOP, DNC of BSF and had been dealing in
torches and repairs and that in the year 2008 the petitioner
had given him a sum of `35,000/- in two instalments, to be
deposited in the account of one Pradhan Singh whose name
and account number was given to him on a piece of paper by
the Petitioner. That for the said job, the petitioner had
promised to pay him `100/-.        Out of `35,000/- he deposited
only `15,000/- and `14,000/- as per deposit slips Ex.U through
the Core Banking System, once from SBI Behrampur and the
second time from SBI Jiyaganj and had spent the remaining
`6000/- when his wife had a delivery. That the petitioner had
approached his father i.e. Kartik Mondal and demanded
`6000/- to be returned.
</p><p id="p_15">13.         On being cross-examined by the petitioner he
denied the suggestion put to him that Pradhan Singh was his
friend whom he owed `29,000/- and had hence sent the money
to him through the Core Banking System.          He denied the
suggestion that the petitioner had paid him `1200/- for
purchase of 2 torches from his shop near the Border Outpost
of BSF and since he had not supplied the torches, the
petitioner was demanding return of `1200/-.
</p><p id="p_16">14.         Kartik Mondal PW-3, the person who had filed the
complaint against the petitioner and upon which complaint the
preliminary investigation was conducted deposed that he had

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">  W.P.(C) No.8580/2010                                 Page 8 of 18</span>
 a shop at Lalgola near BOP, DNC BSF and used to deal in torch
lights and that along with one Batul the petitioner had visited
his shop on 5.1.2009 and demanded `35,000/- stating that he
had given the said money to his son and threatened that he
would kill father and son and burn their house if the money
was not returned. When he enquired from his son his son told
him that the petitioner had given him `35,000/- to be
deposited in the account of one Pradhan Singh in Punjab out of
which his son had spent `6,000/- and had deposited only
`29,000/- and that since he was threatened by the petitioner
he had lodged the complaint Ex.‟L‟.
</p><p id="p_17">15.         On    being   cross-examined   he   denied    knowing
Pradhan Singh and denied that on 5.1.2009 the petitioner had
merely asked for `1200/- to be refunded on account of stated
payment being advanced to his son for purchase of 2 torches.
</p><p id="p_18">16.         Inspector (Min.) K.R.Ashok Kumar PW-4, deposed
that he is the Accountant and Cashier attached to the 105 Bn.
and that the salary of the petitioner was regularly credited in
Account No.30185191589 maintained with SBI Lalbadh in the
name of the petitioner and that after perusing petitioner‟s
passbook Ex.‟V‟ he had prepared the statement Ex.„W‟
pertaining to the money deposited and withdrawn from the
account of the petitioner and that at the time when `29,000/-
was transmitted through Core Banking System to the account
of Pradhan Singh at SBI Ajnala the petitioner had not made
withdrawals totalling either `29,000/- or `35,000/-.

as DW-1 who deposed that he was a resident of North

 Nadibara Para Village and that on a date he could not recollect
he had visited the market to purchase vegetables where he
saw petitioner having quarrelled with Kartik Mondal and learnt
that the dispute pertained to a sum of `1200/- being
demanded by Kartik Mondal from the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_20">18.         After evidence was recorded, the petitioner made a
statement in defence which reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       "I do not know who is Pradhan Singh. I have not
       given any money to civilian named Amrit Mondal s/o
       Kartik Mondal. I had given `1,200/- to the said civilian
       named Amrit Mondal for purchase of new torch. He
       neither gave me any receipt of the said money nor
       handed over torch to me against `1,200/-. Thereafter
       he was not available in his shop which was found
       closed for a number of days. On enquiry from the
       shopkeepers near BOP DMC of BSF camp. I came to
       know that Kartik Mondal, the father of Amrit Mondal
       owns a shop at Lalgola. I, in order to recover my
       `1,200/- from Amrit Mondal went to the shop of Kartik
       Mondal at Lalgola and asked for Amrit Mondal‟s
       whereabouts. Kartik Mondal said he was not there. I
       told Kartik Mondal to direct Amrit Mondal either to
       return my money i.e. `1,200/- or make him to meet
       me."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">19.         The Court returned a verdict of „Guilt‟.            The
Commandant further held that in view of the verdict of guilt,
the petitioner be dismissed from service and with respect to
the penalty noted that though never levied any penalty for the
18 years and 4 months service rendered by the petitioner till
22.10.2009 i.e. the date of the sentence, was proceeded
against twice for having committed offences under the BSF
Act.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> W.P.(C) No.8580/2010                                   Page 10 of 18</span>
<p id="p_22"> 20.         Challenging    the   verdict   of   „Guilt‟   and     the
punishment imposed, learned counsel for the petitioner urged
6 submissions as under:-
</p><p id="p_23">(i)         That the Court has given no reasons to sustain the
verdict of guilt.
</p><p id="p_24">(ii)        That the Charge framed against the petitioner was
vague and suffered from a misjoinder as the name of the
person who effected the transfer on behalf of the petitioner
was not stated and further since money was remitted to
Pradhan Singh on 2 different dates, 2 different charges should
have been framed.
</p><p id="p_25">(iii)       That the Commandant did not comply with Rule
45(1)(a)&amp;(b) of the BSF Rules 1969 inasmuch as material
witnesses were not examined.
</p><p id="p_26">(iv)        That the complaint made by Kartik Mondal was a
vague accusation and did not disclose the story stated by the
complainant during the court proceedings thereby leading to a
reasonable/logical inference that the story recited during the
Court proceedings was an afterthought to frame the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_27">(v)         That it was not satisfactorily established that the
petitioner was in possession of the amount said to have been
deposited on his behalf and no relation was shown to exist
between the petitioner and Pradhan Singh, the beneficiary of
the money deposited.
</p><p id="p_28">(vi)        Lastly it was urged that the excellent service record
of the petitioner was not kept in mind while awarding the
harsh sentence of dismissal from service upon the petitioner.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11"> W.P.(C) No.8580/2010                                     Page 11 of 18</span>
<p id="p_29"> 21.         The first contention urged has to be negated in
view of the decision reported as AIR 2010 SC 1551 <a href="/doc/747386/" id="a_1">UOI &amp; Anr.
vs. Dinesh Kumar</a> wherein it was held that in view of Rule
117(2) and Rule 149 of the BSF Rules 1969 neither the
Appellate Authority nor the Court holding Summary Trial has to
give reasons for its decision.
</p><p id="p_30">22.         The second plea is rejected for the reason the
purpose of a charge is to contain such details as the
foundation of the accusation wherefrom a reasonable person
can reasonably understand the nature of the accusation and
the offence stated to have been committed.         The charge
against the petitioner with the statement of imputation makes
it clear that the allegation against him was of having sent
`29,000/- through a local contact to Pradhan Singh (in account
No.10734663685) and that said sum was in excess to the
known source of the income of the petitioner and the
petitioner had not satisfactorily explained said amount being
with him. In a case of the kind different charges for different
sums recovered, possessed or transmitted by a person on
different dates have not to be framed and thus we hold that
the charge neither suffers from any misjoinder, nor is vague.
We do not understand the logic of the third submission for the
reason Rule 45(1)(a)&amp;(b) of the BSF Rules 1969 read as
under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">      "45. Hearing of the charge against an enrolled person -
      (1) The charge shall be heard by the Commandant of the
      accused -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      (a) the charge and statement of witness if recorded
            shall be read over to the accused.       If written
            statements of witnesses are not available, he shall

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> W.P.(C) No.8580/2010                                Page 12 of 18</span>
               hear as many witnesses as he may consider
              essential to enable him to determine the issue;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">        (b)   the accused shall be given an opportunity to cross-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">              examine the witnesses and make a statement in his
              defence."</blockquote>

<p id="p_31">23.           It is apparent that the Rule pertains to the stage of
the recording of the Summary of Evidence and assuming it
relates even to the Court Proceedings, merely requires the
hearing of the witnesses and an opportunity given to the
accused to cross-examine the witnesses and thereafter make a
statement in defence.
</p><p id="p_32">24.           In the instant case after the petitioner made his
statement in defence, he had examined a defence witness and
therefore it cannot be even argued that the petitioner was not
given a reasonable opportunity to examine his witnesses.
</p><p id="p_33">25.           As regards the fourth plea, it has to be kept in mind
that Kartik Mondal was a petty shopkeeper, operating from a
small     shop    and   was    thus   not   possessed    of   good
communicative skill. His complaint was that the petitioner was
threatening him and his son for not paying him `35,000/- and
the testimony of Kartik Mondal and his son Amrit Mondal also
centers around `35,000/-. It be noted that in the testimony,
the father and son spoke about petitioner handing over
`35,000/- to Amrit Mondal to be remitted to Pradhan Singh and
Amrit Mondal remitting only `29,000/- and appropriating
`6,000/-.     It is possible that he who typed the complaint on
behalf of Kartik Mondal did not understand what Kartik Mondal
was requiring to be complained about. The language of the
complaint, which we note is in English language and has been

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13"> W.P.(C) No.8580/2010                                   Page 13 of 18</span>
 typed on a typewriter brings out the poor communicative skills
of whosoever typed the same.
</p><p id="p_34">26.         At the heart of the matter is the issue whether it
has been satisfactorily proved that `29,000/- deposited by
Amrit Mondal with the Behrampur and Jiyaganj branch of SBI
and through the Core Banking System credited in the account
of Pradhan Singh was the ill-gotten wealth of the petitioner for
the reason the testimony of PW-4 clearly establishes that
during the period `29,000/- was transmitted to the account of
Pradhan Singh the petitioner was not possessed of `29,000/-.
</p><p id="p_35">27.         At the backdrop of the issue, the petitioner‟s
defence that having wanted to purchase a torch, which we
were given to understand during hearing of the writ petition
was in fact a rechargeable battery operated torch, the
petitioner claimed to have advanced `1,200/- to Kartik Mondal
who admittedly was a shopkeeper operating from a footpath
and the claim of the petitioner that Kartik Mondal neither sold
him a torch nor returned `1,200/-, which he demanded and by
way of retaliation, Kartik Mondal and his son framed him.
</p><p id="p_36">28.         Now, evidence conclusively establishes `29,000/-
being deposited in the account of Pradhan Singh with the
Ajnala Branch of SBI and the money being transmitted through
the Core Banking System from the Behrampur and Jiyaganj
branches of SBI, both branches being in Murshidabad i.e. the
place where the unit of the petitioner was stationed and where
Kartik Mondal and Amrit Mondal resided.
</p><p id="p_37">29.         But the question would be, whether there is
sufficient evidence or even evidence of a highly probable

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14"> W.P.(C) No.8580/2010                                Page 14 of 18</span>
 quality to probablize that this money was handed over by the
petitioner to Amrit Mondal.
</p><p id="p_38">30.         In the testimony of Amrit Kumar Mondal and his
father it has emerged that they were petty shopkeepers.
There is conclusive evidence of `29,000/- being credited to the
account of Pradhan Singh and since Amrit Mondal had handed
over the deposit slips pertaining to said amount it is apparent
that it was Amrit Mondal who had deposited the said sum
which got credited in the account of Pradhan Singh. Though
not examined as a witness, but as disclosed by him during
preliminary inquiry to ASI Darshan Singh he had received the
said amount by way of return of the money lent by him to
Amrit Mondal and we find that petitioner has adopted said line
of cross-examination while cross examining Amrit Mondal.
</p><p id="p_39">31.         The issue would be: Whether the line of cross-
examination adopted, which is consistent with what Pradhan
Singh told ASI Darshan Singh, inspires confidence for the
reason we have only two versions, and one of which has to be
correct. The two versions are as stated by Amrit Mondal that
petitioner had handed over to him `35,000/- to be transmitted
to the account of Pradhan Singh through the Core Banking
System out of which he pocketed `6,000/- and transmitted
only `29,000/- and the rival version that Amrit Mondal had
been lent `29,000/- by Pradhan Singh which he returned when
he made the two deposits.
</p><p id="p_40">32.         It is apparent that out of two versions, the one
which is probablized more than the other needs to be
accepted.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15"> W.P.(C) No.8580/2010                               Page 15 of 18</span>
<p id="p_41"> 33.         The version of the petitioner and Pradhan Singh is
uninspiring for various reasons; being (i) Amrit Mondal and his
father are petty shopkeepers and it would be difficult to
believe that Pradhan Singh, a stated transporter, would lend
`29,000/- to Amrit Mondal in the absence of any proof of
Pradhan Singh having any business dealings with Amrit
Mondal. (ii) There is not even an iota of evidence that the two
were friends.      (iii) No acknowledgment was produced by
Pradhan Singh to even remotely suggest his having lent
`29,000/- to Amrit Mondal. (iv) Pradhan Singh gave no proof to
ASI Darshan Singh of being in transport business or being in
Murshidabad at any point of time.
</p><p id="p_42">34.         That apart, it would be difficult to accept that Amrit
Mondal who, if at all returned a loan taken, by depositing the
amount with the two branches of the State Bank of India,
would retain the deposit slips with him. If he had deposited
the amount by way of return of loan, the logical next step
would be to send the receipts to the beneficiary as proof of
having returned the loan.
</p><p id="p_43">35.         On the aforesaid reasons, the version of Amrit
Mondal returning the loan is highly tenuous. If this be so it is
extremely difficult to believe that Amrit Mondal would deposit
`29,000/- to wreck vengeance against the petitioner. Further,
how would Amrit Mondal know the 15 digit bank account of
Pradhan Singh as also the bank code at Ajnala. It is here that
it assumes importance that petitioner is a resident of a village
nearby the village in which Pradhan Singh resides.             The



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16"> W.P.(C) No.8580/2010                                  Page 16 of 18</span>
 evidence highly probablizes that the petitioner had given said
particulars to Amrit Mondal.
</p><p id="p_44">36.         The testimony of PW-4 conclusively establishes that
during the period in question the petitioner had withdrawals
less than `29,000/- from his account and thus there is
evidence to highly probablize that the petitioner had been
making illegal money.
</p><p id="p_45">37.         Complaints by civilians of extortion at the hands of
jawans of the Paramilitary Forces are a subject matter of
various judicial pronouncements and especially in areas near
borders where smuggling and human trafficking takes place
and thus we need not expand as to the source of the ill gotten
wealth of the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_46">38.         Within the parameters of evaluation of evidence at
a domestic inquiry, we are satisfied that there is overwhelming
evidence to highly probablize the indictment and the defence
is extremely shaky.
</p><p id="p_47">39.         Thus, the 5th contention advanced is rejected.
</p><p id="p_48">40.         As    regards   the   last   plea   urged    on     the
proportionality of the punishment, it is true that the instant
indictment is the solitary indictment, but it has to be noted
that in the past also there were two indictments against the
petitioner which could not be proved.
</p><p id="p_49">41.         Ill-gotten wealth is acquired in the darkness of
secrecy and there is always a cover up and thus it is difficult to
repeatedly catch the wrongdoers.         That a wrong of being
possessed with ill gotten wealth being caught for the first time



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17"> W.P.(C) No.8580/2010                                   Page 17 of 18</span>
 does   not    mean       that   the   wrongdoer      indulges    in   the
misdemeanour for the first time.
</p><p id="p_50">42.          Scope of judicial review on the proportionality of the
punishment     is   limited     and   unless   it   is   demonstratably
shockingly disproportionate to the gravity of the offence, the
Court cannot interfere with a penalty which otherwise is within
the discretion of the Disciplinary Authority.
</p><p id="p_51">43.          The writ petition is dismissed.
</p><p id="p_52">44.          No costs.
