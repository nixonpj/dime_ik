<p id="p_1">                                    [Order of this Court was made by R.SUBBIAH,J.]

                                   This petition is filed praying for issuance of a Writ of Habeas

                      Corpus to direct respondents to produce the detenue, by name S.Gayathri,

                      aged about 17 years, daughter of petitioner-Santhana Krishnan, before this

                      Court and set her at liberty.
</p>
<p id="p_2">


</p><p id="p_3">                                   2. The petitioner is the father of the detenue-S.Gayathri, who

                      is aged about 17 years. The detenue is a school student. On 24.10.2019, the

                      detenue went to her School as usual but she has not returned home.

                      Thereafter, the petitioner searched the detenue from her relatives and

                      neighbours, home but she could not trace the detenue. In this regard, the

                      petitioner preferred a complaint before the second respondent-Police,

                      which was registered in Crime No.520 of 2019 as "Girl Missing". After 12

                      days, the detenue was secured by the second respondent-Police and the

                      petitioner came to know that the detenue was abducted by the third

                      respondent and she was presently kept in Kelly's Government Home. Hence,

                      the petitioner has come up with the present Habeas Corpus Petition.

</p><p id="p_4">                                  3. When the petition is taken up for hearing today, the

                      detenue-S.Gayathri is produced before this Court. She is aged about 17

                      years. Learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondents

                      submitted that a case has been registered as against the third respondent

                      under <a href="/doc/796352/" id="a_2">Section 366(A)</a> of IPC and after medical examination, the second

                      respondent-Police would alter the FIR one under POCSO Act. When we

                      enquired the detenue, she has expressed her willingness to go along with

                      the petitioner-father. The petitioner-father is also present before this

                      Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                                  4. Since the detenue is willing to go along with the petitioner-

                      father, no further deliberations in that regard is warranted in this case.

                      However, the second respondent-Police is directed to complete the

                      investigation in respect of the above said complaint registered in Crime

                      No.520 of 2019 and proceed further.

                      closed.
