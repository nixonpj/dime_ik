                 Crl. APPEAL No.2595 of 2009
                     -------------------------------
            Dated this the 5th day of March, 2010.

                          J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     This appeal is at the instance of the complainant, in a

prosecution for the offence punishable u/s.138 of the <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_1">Negotiable

Instruments Act</a>, as he is aggrieved by the order of acquittal

passed by the court below u/s.256(1) of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">Cr.P.C</a>.

</p><p id="p_2">     2.   The cheques in question covered an amount of

Rs.20,000/- and the complainant/appellant is an Aluminum

Fabricator.  It is submitted by the learned counsel that, the

complainant was earnestly prosecuting the complaint and there

was no willful latches or negligence on his part in appearing

before the court below on 9.11.2009 and the court below issued

the impugned order inspite of the petition filed by the

complainant to excuse his absence.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3.   From the cause title, it appears that the case is

pertained to the year 2008 and the complainant was present on

4.11.2009 but the accused was absent on that day. It is true that,

the complainant was directed to appear on 4.11.2009 and to

Crl. APPEAL No.2595 of 2009
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 2</span>

adduce evidence on 9.11.2009 but according to the learned

Magistrate, he did not turn up on 9.11.2009, inspite of the

direction issued on 4.11.2009.     Nothing discernible from the

impugned order as to whether the complainant had represented

on the date of the impugned order or any application was filed to

condone his absence. The learned counsel made available to

me the certified copy of the order dated 9.11.2009 in

Crl.M.P.No.4519/09 in S.T.C.No.2628/08 of JFCM Court-I,

Ottappalam. The learned counsel also made available to me a

copy of the petition mentioned in the above order and on perusal

of the said petition, it can be seen that he was unable to attend

the court on 9.11.2009, as he had to attend an interview which

was scheduled on 10.11.2009 and 11.11.2009, for selection to

the post of Aluminum Fabricator in a company in Dubai. The

above ground is not referred to, by the learned Magistrate, in the

order dated 9.11.2009 which was issued in Crl.M.P.No.4519/09.

So it is clear that, the observation made by the court below in

the said order is absolutely incorrect. It is also relevant to note

that whatever be the reason stated in the order of the learned

Magistrate in the above criminal miscellaneous petition, the

Crl. APPEAL No.2595 of 2009
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>

same will not find a place in the impugned order. The non-

mentioning of the order dated 9.11.2009 in Crl.M.P.No.4519/09

in S.T.C.No.2628/08, itself is a ground to set aside the

impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       4. It is beyond dispute that the complainant was present

on 4.11.2009 and he was absent on 9.11.2009, though there

was a direction to be present on that day. But the complainant

was re-presented on the date of the impugned order and

requested the court to condone the delay by filing a proper

petition but the same was rejected without assigning proper

reasoning and such production has no bearing in the impugned

order. Under the above circumstances, I cannot sustain the

order passed by the Trial Court on 9.11.2009, acquitting the

accused u/s.256(1) of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3">Cr.P.C</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       In the result, the impugned order dated 9.11.2009 in

S.T.C.No.2628/08 of the       JFCM Court-I, Ottappalam, is set

aside. The appellant/complainant is directed to appear before

the Trial Court on 5.4.2010 on which date, the learned

Magistrate is directed to restore the case on file and to proceed

with the same in accordance with law and procedure and

dispose of the same on merit.
