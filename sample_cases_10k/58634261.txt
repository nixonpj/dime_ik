                     of the Cr.P.C. for grant of bail in connection with Crime No. 05/19 registered
                     at P.S. Gadarwara, District - Narsinghpur (M.P.) for the offence punishable
                     under <a href="/doc/170198/" id="a_2">sections 41(1)(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_3">379</a>, <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_4">411</a>, <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_5">379</a> and <a href="/doc/812083/" id="a_6">411</a> of IPC.
</p><p id="p_3">                             As per the prosecution story, the allegation against the applicant is that
                     he purchased the motorcycle from the co-accused which was of theft.
</p><p id="p_4">                             Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant is innocent

                     was not knowing the fact that the said vehicle was of theft. He has no criminal

                     the aforesaid grounds, prayer is made to release the applicant on bail.

</p><p id="p_7">                             Looking to the entire evidence available on record alongwith the role
                     attributed by the applicant in the offence and the fact that no criminal case has
                     been registered against him, this application is allowed without commenting
                     anything on the merits of the case. It is ordered that the applicant/accused
                     Sonu Naiem @ Mohammad Ameer be released on bail on his furnishing a
