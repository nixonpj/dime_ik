</p><p id="p_6">4.     In these civil appeals, question arises with respect

to the calculation of the pension on the basis of the

definition of average emoluments given in Regulation 2(d)

read with definition of the pay, as defined in Regulation

2(s)   of   the    Bank        (Employees)        Pension       Regulations,        1995

(hereinafter referred to as, “the Regulations of 1995), of

the concerned Banks.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.     The dispute is with respect to the employees who

retired or died while in service on or after 1.4.1998 and

before 31.10.2002.              The Banks are governed by the Banking

Companies (Acquisition and <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_1">Transfer of Undertakings Act</a>,

1970 (hereinafter referred to as, “the Act of 1970”).                                The

regulations        have        been     framed       in    exercise       of    powers

conferred under <a href="/doc/635869/" id="a_2">Section 19</a> of the Act of 1970.

</p><p id="p_8">6.     We    are    concerned           in    the    instant      cases    with      the

officer’s    class        of    the     Banks.        The       provisions     of    the

<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_3">Industrial        Disputes            Act</a>,     1947       are     admittedly         not

respective nationalized banks, in exercise of their powers

under <a href="/doc/635869/" id="a_4">Section 19</a> of the Act of 1970, in consultation with

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and with prior sanction of

Central Government, had notified in Gazette the aforesaid

</p><p id="p_11">8.      It   appears      that   Indian   Banks’     Association        was

negotiating     with   the   Officers’    Association      and   a    Joint

Note had been entered into and was signed on 14.12.1999,

with regard to periodical pay revision of the officers of

the member Banks.         Joint Note indicated the date of effect

of scale of pay, dearness allowance and pension, as was

agreed to be with effect from 1.4.1998. Thereafter, on

18.1.2003 amendment had been made in the definition of

‘pay’, as defined in Regulation 2(s) of the Regulations of

1995 and explanation thereof was added.

</p><p id="p_12">9.      The dispute arose after the amendment had been made

with respect to pension which would be payable to the

Officers who have died or retired after 1.4.1998.                Though,

the    definition    of    ‘average   emoluments’,    as    defined      in

Regulation 2(d) of the Regulations of 1995, specified that

the average of the pay drawn by the employee during the

last ten months of his service in the Bank shall be taken

as “Average Emoluments”, so as to work out the pension

under Regulation 35(2). Regulation 35(2) provided that the

basis of the calculation to be 50% of average emoluments,

as    defined   in   Regulation   2(d).     Regulation      38   of     the

Regulations 1995 provided the method of determination of

the period of ten months for average emoluments.                     In the

case    of   voluntary     retirement/premature      retirement,        the

Bank shall reckon the period of ‘preceding’ ten months for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   4</span>

the purpose of average emoluments, from the date on which

the employee voluntarily retires or prematurely retires.

By   virtue   of   the    explanation   (c)    that   was     added   in

Regulation    2(s)   of    the   Regulations    of    1995,    it     was

provided that the pay shall be taken to mean the pay and

emoluments that had been drawn before 1.4.1998 for the

category of the officers, who have retired or died on or

after 1.4.1998. The provisions contained in Regulations

2(d), 2(s)(c), 35, 37 and 38,are extracted hereunder:

</p><p id="p_31">10.     Reading of Regulation 2(d) makes it clear that the

average     emoluments     means    the       average   pay    drawn    by   the

employee during last ten months of his service in the

Bank.       Thus, the person becomes entitled for computation

of the salary drawn in the last ten months, along with its

components,        for   computation         of   the   pension   and    other

benefits.         The amended provision was added on 18.01.2003

by    way    of    explanation     (c)       to   Regulation    2(s)    giving

retrospective effect.

</p><p id="p_33">11.   The   High   Court      of    Delhi      had   opined    that    once      the

benefit had been taken under the Joint Note of revision of

the salary, estoppel is created against the officers to

claim    the   pension     as      per   the    existing      formulae,         which

prevailed before its amendment and amendment could have

been made with retrospective effect. Thus, the Delhi High

Court    had    dismissed       the      writ    petition      filed       by    the

Officers’ Association, against which an appeal had been

preferred. The High Court of Madras and High Court of

Karnataka      have    taken       the    contrary     view.          They      have

observed that Joint Note of 1999 could not have supplanted

the existing rules/regulations.                  Pension was required to

be determined under the existing Regulations. By amending

the     Regulation      and     adding         the    Explanation       (c)        in

Regulation 2(s) in the month of January 2003 benefit that

has accrued could not have taken away.                   Thus, we have two

contrary views of the High Courts to adjudicate upon in

the instant matters.
</p>
<p id="p_34">

</p><p id="p_35">12.      It was urged by learned counsel on behalf of the

Banks that in view of the Joint Note that was prepared,

parties were bound as the benefits were to be given as

agreed to after revision of the pay in the method and

manner, which was agreed to by the officers.                      Thus, there

was     estoppel      created      against      the    Officers       to        claim

contrary to the Joint Note.                   They cannot claim/take one

benefit out of the Joint Note and deny the other part of

the same.      There is power to amend the Regulations with

retrospective    effect       and     it   cannot   be   said   that   any

accrued right has been taken away in view of the Joint

note.    Parties were aware of the situation, as such; the

Joint Note that had been signed was binding and became

enforceable.      It    was    also    the   methodology    adopted    for

industrial   workers     under      conciliation     agreement   entered

into under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_5">Industrial Disputes Act</a>,

1947.
</p>
<p id="p_36">

</p><p id="p_37">13.     It was contended by Mr. B.B. Sawhney, learned senior

counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents-Officers

that accrued rights could not have been taken away.                    The

definition of average emoluments in Regulation 2(d) has

not been amended.        The only amendment made is by way of

insertion in the Explanation (c) to Regulation 2(s) of the

Regulations of 1995.          Regulations 35 and 38 have also not

been amended.     As such, the emoluments payable under the

aforesaid Regulation for the preceding ten months have to

be considered.         The Explanation is ineffective to take

away the rights conferred under the Regulation 2(d), read

with Regulations 35 and 38 of the Regulations of 1995.



</p><p id="p_38">14.     It was also contended on behalf of officers that

pension is not a bounty. The right to receive pension

under the prevailing formulae could not have been taken

away with retrospective effect by amending the provisions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                       10</span>

of the Regulations. The requisite amendments were not made

in    other    provisions      of     the     Regulations,        which    were

necessary      to   take    away    the     said    rights.   It    was    also

contended that only for few years the said provision had

been incorporated so as to deny the benefit from 1998 to

2002.    Thereafter, by amending the Regulations in the year

2005 the benefit has again been restored and pension had

been paid all throughout on the basis of emoluments, which

were drawn in the preceding ten months from the date of

retirement.
</p>
<p id="p_39">

</p><p id="p_40">15.     First we come to the rigour of the Regulations. The

Regulations have statutory force, having been framed in

exercise of the powers under <a href="/doc/325738/" id="a_6">Section 19(2)(f)</a> of the Act

of    1970    and   are    binding.         They    could   not    have    been

supplanted by any executive fiat or order or Joint Note,

which has no statutory basis.                      The Joint Note of the

officers also had no statutory force behind it and could

not have obliterated any of the provisions of Act of 1970

or the existing Regulations.              Thus, Joint Notes could, not

have taken away the rights that were available under the

Pension Regulations of 1995 to the Officer.



</p><p id="p_41">16.     Now what is provided under the Regulations is that

an employee is entitled to calculation of his pension, as

provided in Regulations 38(1) and 38(2) in the case of

voluntary      retirement     or    pre-mature       retirement,     and    the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                11</span>

period   of    the    preceding            10    months      for    the    purpose     of

emoluments shall be reckoned from the date on which the

employee      had    been           voluntarily        retired      or     prematurely

retired by the Bank.                 A plain and literal reading of the

provisions     contained            in    Regulation         38   makes    it    crystal

clear that its emphasis is on the preceding 10 months. The

average emoluments no doubt take into consideration the

pay but by deeming fiction, by simply amending and adding

Explanation         (c)        in    Regulation         2(s)       the     mandate     of

Regulation      38(2)          had       not    been    taken       away     and     even

otherwise could not have been taken away that too with the

retrospective effect, which provides pension to be worked

out on the basis of average emoluments of preceding ten

months. It is apparent that Regulations 38(1) and 38(2)

have not been amended in any manner whatsoever.                              Thus, the

provisions     are        in    conflict         to    the    Explanation        (c)   of

Regulation 2(s) that had been added, which defined pay

with retrospective effect. Apparently for the purpose of

pension, the clear provisions in Regulations 38(1) &amp; 38(2)

have to be considered as preceding ten months ‘from the

date of retirement’ and not as per the Explanation (c) to

Regulation 2(s) what was drawn in the preceding ten months

before 1.4.1998. The interpretation of regulation 38(2) as

per   deeming       fiction          of    Regulation         2(s)(c)       is     wholly

impermissible.        That          it    is    not    permissible         to    add   or

subtract any word in a provision is a settled principle of

statutory interpretation.

</p><p id="p_43">17.         Similarly, the provisions contained in Regulation 35

also make an incumbent entitled for opting the pension on

the basis of average emoluments.                  The average emoluments

have to be calculated on the basis of the preceding ten

months.       Adding   Explanation     (c)       to   Regulation       2(s),   as

done, could have created no fictional basis in view of

clear and unambiguous provisions in other provisions of

the Regulations.         Besides, the definition of the average

emoluments in Regulation 2(d) itself makes it clear that

it is average pay drawn “during the last ten months” of

his service by an employee. It cannot mean pay drawn by

the employee even before several years. Mentionably there

is     no    amendment   made     in   the       aforesaid    provision        of

Regulation 2(d) and the expression during the preceding

last    ten     months   before    date     of    retirement      is    clearly

culled out in Regulation 38(1) and 38(2).                     Thus, in our

considered       opinion,   the    view     taken      by   the   then    Chief

Justice Vikramajit Sen as he then was, at Karnataka High

Court and by the High Court of Madras are appropriate and

the view taken by the Delhi High Court cannot be said to

be sustainable for the various other reasons too mentioned

hereinafter.

benefits of the revised scale of pay, and consequently to

    Board of Education, 302 US 74, a
    pension is closely akin to wages in
    that it consists of payment provided by
    an employer, is paid in consideration

down thus :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">       “24. The learned Solicitor General has stated
       that the impugned GOs dated November 22, 1983
       (Annexure I) and dated December 3, 1983

       (Ministry of Defence) in the present case are
       based on recomputation of pension of pre-April
       1, 1979 retirees of Armed Forces according to
       the liberalised pension scheme consequent upon
       the decision in D.S. Nakara Vs. Union of India,
       (1983) 1 SCC 305.    He also added that if any
       error in computation is pointed out in respect
       of any particular person or rank or otherwise,
       the same would be promptly corrected.    On the
       above view taken by us, the prayer made in
       these writ petitions for quashing these orders
       has to be rejected.    For the same reason, its

D.Francis Paul &amp; Ors</a>., 1996 (10) SCC 134, on the aspect of

retrospective provision, this Court has further observed

thus :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">          “4. Relying    upon   this    proviso   by   later
          amendment, it is contended that since no
          specific provision was made in the conditions of
          service   at   the  time   of   appointment,   the
          respondents are not entitled to the benefit of
          the rule.    It is not in dispute that the rule
          came to be amended on 15.11.1976 long after
          their appointment.    Under these circumstances,
          the amendment would be prospective.     It is not
          in dispute that this amendment came to be made
          pursuant to recommendation made by the IIIrd Pay
          Commission and on acceptance thereof the rule
          came to be amended. Under these circumstances,
          the amendment cannot have retrospective effect
          in respect of the persons already in service but
          would be prospective; it would be applicable
          only to those candidates appointed after the
          date of the amendment introducing the proviso.”


</blockquote><p id="p_63">27.      In N.S. Giri Vs. Corporation of City of Mangalore &amp;

Ors., (1999) 4 SCC 697, also this Court has observed that

even   an   Award   made    under    the   <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_22">Industrial    Disputes    Act</a>,

1947, cannot be inconsistent with the law laid by the

legislature or by the Supreme Court and if it does so, it

is illegal and cannot be enforced.
</p>
<p id="p_64">28.      Thus joint note/agreement could not have been in

derogation     of   the    existing       statutory   Regulations    and

regulation 2(s)(c) could not have been given retrospective

effect.     It is also apparent from the decisions of this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                               20</span>

Court    in      P.     Sadagopan        Vs.    Food       Corporation        of   India,

(1997) 4 SCC 301, that executive instructions cannot be

issued      in     derogation       of    the       statutory        Regulations.       The

settled      position          of   law   is        that   no    Government        Order,

Notification            or    Circular     can       be    a    substitute         of   the

statutory rules framed with the authority of law.                                  In Dr.

Rajinder Singh Vs. State of Punjab &amp; Ors. (2001) 5 SCC

482, this Court had reiterated that the settled position

of    law     is      that     no   government         order,        notification        or

circular can be a substitute of the statutory rules framed

with the authority of law.                      In K. Kuppusamy &amp; Anr. Vs.

State of Tamil Nadu, (1998) 8 SCC 469, this Court has

observed         that      statutory      rules       cannot     be       overridden     by

executive orders or executive practice.                                Merely because

the Government had taken a decision to amend the rules,

does not mean that the rule stood obliterated.                                 Till the

rule is amended, the rule applies.
</p>
<p id="p_65">29.      Thus, in our opinion, the Regulations which were in

force till 2003, would apply with full force and as a

matter of fact, the amendments made in it by addition of

Explanation (c) in Regulation 2(s) did not have the effect

of    amending          the    Regulations           relating        to    pension,      as

contained in Regulation 38 read with Regulations 2(d) and

35 of the Regulations of 1995.                       Even otherwise, if it had

the     effect        of      amending     the       pay       and    perks    ‘average

emoluments’, as specified in Regulation 2(d), it could not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                               21</span>

have       operated       retrospectively           and      taken    away      accrued

rights.         Otherwise       also,     it    would        have    been     arbitrary

exercise of power. Besides, there was no binding statutory

force      of      the    so    called    Joint        Note    of     the     Officers’

Association, as admittedly, to Officers’ Association even

the     provisions         of     <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_23">Industrial        Disputes         Act</a>    were     not

applicable and joint note had no statutory support, and it

was not open to forgo the benefits available under the

Regulations          to    those     officers          who    have    retired      from

1.4.1998 till December 1999 and thereafter, and to deprive

them of the benefits of the Regulations. Thus, by the

Joint Note that has been relied upon, no estoppel said to

have been created. There is no estoppel as against the

enforcement of statutory provisions.                          The Joint Note had

no force of law and could not have been against the spirit

of     the        statutory      Regulations        and       the    basic      service

conditions,          as    envisaged      under        the    Regulations        framed

under the Act of 1970. They could not have been tinkered

with in an arbitrary manner, as has been laid down by this

Court        in     <a href="/doc/477313/" id="a_24">Central      Inland        Water      Transport        Corporation

4 SCC 482, where the position was converse.                        Revision of

employees.          Instant    cases       are     not    the    cases    of    the

revision     of     benefits        being     given       with   retrospective

retrospective effect.           Thus the decision in the aforesaid

case has no application.

Menon   &amp;   Ors</a>.,     (1994)    4    SCC     68,    has   been    pressed      into

service in which this Court has laid down with respect to

dearness allowance granted to a Government servant, who

retired on or after 30.9.1977.                     It was claimed that the

said benefit should be given retrospectively to all the

employees irrespective of their date of superannuation.

It was not the case of taking away of vested right or

accrued     right    with     retrospective         amendment.       Thus,     the

decision has no application.

</p><p id="p_72">305.    It was observed in the context of pension scheme

that was non-contributory in character that the benefit,

which was given under the scheme, was prospective. In all

cases wherever they retire, they would be governed by the

liberalized       pension     scheme,       because       the    scheme    was    a

scheme for payment of the pension governed by 1972 Rules.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                               23</span>

The date of retirement would be the relevant date.                                   The

revised scheme would be operative from the date mentioned

in the scheme.             It was also not a case of taking away the

benefit       that    had    accrued          with    retrospective        effect      or

taking away of the vested or accrued rights.                               Thus, the

decision      has     no    application,            rather    the    spirit    of    the

decision       runs     counter          to    and    fails    to     buttress      the

submissions raised on behalf of the banks.


</p><p id="p_73">33.     The only purpose of the addition of Explanation (c)

to     Regulation          2(s),        was    to     take     away     the      actual

computation of the pension on the basis of the salary,

which was drawn in the preceding ten months. Thus, we have

no    hesitation       to        strike       it    down   being     arbitrary       and

repugnant       to    other           provisions/Regulations          namely      2(d),

38(1)(2) and 35.                 The Explanation (c) to Regulation 2(s)

is hereby struck down, as it could not have been enacted

retrospectively             to        take     away    accrued        rights.       Even

otherwise also it is held to be arbitrary and irrational.

More    so,    in     view       of    the    fact    that    only    by   way    of   a

temporary measure, that discrimination was created and the

Explanation was deleted with effect from 1.5.2005.

Court of Delhi and affirm that of High Courts of Karnataka

filed by the Banks are dismissed and the appeal filed by
