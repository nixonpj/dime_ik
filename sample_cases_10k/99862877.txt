         HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJ KUMAR GARG

                        Judgment / Order

20/12/2018

</pre><p id="p_5">     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as

learned Public Prosecutor.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     Counsel for the petitioner submits that ten witnesses have

already been examined before the trial court. It is further argued

that learned Courts below have not appreciated the fact that the

petitioner is juvenile and entitled to get benefit of provisions of the

Act of 2015. The petitioner is in custody since 22.11.2016 and no

further detention of the petitioner is required for any purpose.

Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the

gravity of the offence committed cannot be a ground to decline

bail to a juvenile. In these circumstances, the benefit of bail may

be granted to the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_7">                                     (2 of 3)             [CRLR-858/2018]



     Learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the prayer for bail

made by the counsel for the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     I have carefully considered the submissions made by the

learned counsel for the parties and also perused the provisions of

the Act of 2015.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     While referring to Section 12 of the Act of 2015, counsel for

the petitioner has urged that releasing a juvenile on bail is a rule

and his detention is an exception. True it is that under the

provisions of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>. in the matter of consideration of bail plea of

an individual, seriousness of delinquency is a significant factor for

nixing the bail and that aspect cannot be looked into when

offender is a juvenile but then there are certain other relevant

factors which are not to be eschewed by the Court. The law

envisages that release of a juvenile is not desirable if it is belief of

the Court that such release may bring the person in association

with any known criminal or expose the said person to moral,

physical or psychological danger, or that his release would defeat

the ends of justice. Similar view was taken by co-ordinate Bench

of this Court in the case of Vishal @ Ritik Vs. State of Rajasthan

(S.B. Criminal Revision Petition No. 1520/2017) decided on

23.01.2018

     Upon appreciation of the arguments advanced by the learned

counsel for petitioner, I do not foresee that releasing the petitioner

on bail would bring him in association with any known criminal or

expose him to moral, physical or psychological danger, however, in

the backdrop of his criminal delinquencies, I feel persuaded that

such release would defeat the ends of justice as the allegations

against juvenile are for offences under <a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_2">Sections 447</a>, <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_3">302</a> IPC and

as many as ten witnesses have already been examined before the
                                                                       (3 of 3)             [CRLR-858/2018]



                                   trial court and PW-1 Smt. Hakari Devi and PW-7 Ms. Chanda

                                   specifically named the present petitioner that he inflicted lathi

                                   blow on the head of the deceased, as a result of which the he fall

                                   down and died as also the petitioner is main accused in this case.

                                   Therefore, at this stage, releasing him on bail would not be in the

                                   interest of justice. Thus, I am unable to find any illegality or

                                   impropriety in the orders passed by the Courts below so as to

                                   invoke revisional jurisdiction in the matter.

</p><p id="p_10">                                        In view thereof, the revision petition fails and same is hereby

                                   dismissed. The trial court is directed to expedite the trial.
