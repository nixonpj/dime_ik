CC No. 3732/16             1/7     Sultan Singh vs. Sunil Tandon
 BRIEF FACTS AND REASONS FOR THE DECISION OF THE CASE



1.        The story projected by the complainant is that he had given a loan of

Rs.2Lakhs to the accused which was to be paid within nine months and a

receipt was also executed in this regard. It is further stated that two cheques of

Rs.1Lakh each (hereinafter referred to as the cheque in question) were issued

by the accused in order to discharge his liability towards the loan.


          However, the cheque was dishonoured and no payment was made

despite service of legal notice and hence this complaint.




2.        Accused had contested the case on point of liability towards the

cheques in question. He has admitted the receipt of legal notice and has also

replied the same. He has denied having taking any loan from the complainant

or executing any receipt. Both the parties examined themselves as witnesses.

No other witness was examined.




3.        The only controversy which is required to be determined is whether

cheque has been given against liability or not. Since signatures on the cheque




CC No. 3732/16                 2/7    Sultan Singh vs. Sunil Tandon
 has been admitted, presumption u/s 139 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_4">N.I. Act</a> has to be drawn. Thus, it is to

be presumed that complainant has received the cheque for discharge, in whole

or in part of any debt or other liability. With respect to scope and ambit of

aforesaid presumption it would be relevant to refer to judgment of Hon'ble

Supreme Court titled "<a href="/doc/363129/" id="a_5">Kumar Exports v. Sharma Carpets</a>", AIR 2009 SC

1518. In para 11 of this judgment it was observed ­


          "The accused in a trial under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_6">Section 138</a> of the Act has two
options. He can either show that consideration and debt did not exist or that
under the particular circumstances of the case the non­existence of
consideration and debt is so improbable that a prudent man ought to
suppose that no consideration or debt existed".



4.        Thus, initial burden is upon accused to show, on scale of

preponderance of probability, that no liability or consideration exists regarding

the cheque in question.




5.        Ld. Counsel for the complainant has argued that the loan amount

was not reflected in the ITR and hence the case of the complainant is doubtful.

This argument does not help the accused in view of judgment of Hon'ble High

Court of Delhi in Lekh Raj Sharma v. Yashpal Gupta, 2015 VI AD (Delhi)


CC No. 3732/16                 3/7    Sultan Singh vs. Sunil Tandon
 223, wherein it was observed that ­


          21. "The Finding that, as the amount of loan disbursed to the

respondent was not shown in the balance sheet and ITR, the appellant could</pre>

<p id="p_1">not be said to have proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, is also

erroneous".
</p>
<p id="p_2">


</p><p id="p_3">6.        Ld. Counsel for the accused has also stated that since the loan

amount of Rs.2 Lakhs was given in cash, same is in violation of Section 269

SS of Income Tax Act and claim of the complainant should be rejected.

However, this argument also does not cut ice in view of judgment of Hon'ble

High Court of Delhi in case CRL.L.P. 559/2015 titled <a href="/doc/4753698/" id="a_7">Sheela Sharma v.

Mahendra Pal</a>, wherein it was held as below :­


          "The mere advancement of the loan in cash, may entail
consequences for the party acting in breach of Section 269 SS of the Income
Tax Act. That is not the concern of this Court. Whether, or not, the appellant
reflected the availability of the said amount in her income­tax returns, is also
not a matter of concern for this Court. That would again be an aspect to be
considered by the income­tax authorities. The advancement of loan, in cash, to
the tune of Rs.10 Lakhs is not prohibited in law. The transaction of
advancement of loan of Rs.10 Lakhs, in cash, does is not illegal. Such a
transaction is enforceable at law. 25. Breach of Section 269 SS of the Income


CC No. 3732/16                4/7     Sultan Singh vs. Sunil Tandon
 Tax Act provides the penalty to which the person would be subjected to under
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_8">Section 271D</a> of the Income Tax Act. <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_9">Section 271D</a> does not provide that such
a transaction would be null &amp; void. The payer of the money in cash ­ in
violation of Section 269 SS of the Income Tax Act would, therefore, be entitled
to enforce an agreement of advancement of money in cash beyond
Rs.20,000/­".
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">7.        Lastly, it has been argued on behalf of the accused that particulars

were not filled by the accused and hence case of the complainant cannot

succeed. The signature on the cheque in question are not disputed. The same

is sufficient.   No law requires that all the columns must be filled by

drawer/maker himself. Reliance is placed upon several judgments on Hon'ble

High Court of Delhi viz. <a href="/doc/692276/" id="a_10">Ravi Chopra V. State</a> 2008 (2) JCC (NI) 169,

<a href="/doc/143232225/" id="a_11">Vijender Singh V. M/s Eicher Motors Crl</a>. M.C. No.1454/2011 decided on

05.05.2011 and Tarun Gautam V. State Crl. M.C. No.529/2012.




</p><p id="p_6">8.        The perusal of record shows that the accused has continuously

shifted his stand during the course of trial. At the time of framing of notice on

01.12.18 he had stated that the cheque was not issued by him to the

complainant. However, during his statement u/s 313 <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_12">Cr.P.C</a> he stated that the

cheques were given by him to the complainant but he suspected some fraud


CC No. 3732/16                 5/7    Sultan Singh vs. Sunil Tandon
 and stopped payment. During his testimony, accused again changed his stand

and deposed that cheques were given to the complainant as the complainant

needed some money for construction of some property. Hence, due to

continuous change in the stand of the accused at various stage of trial, the

defence of the accused appears to be improbable.
</p>
<p id="p_7">


</p><p id="p_8">9.        Further, the accused has not been able to prove any requirement on

the part of the complainant for money or any material to show that cheques in

question were given by him for purpose of investment. The accused has also

testified that he later given cash amount of Rs.2 lakhs to the complainant.

However, no material/receipt in this regard has been placed on record.




</p><p id="p_9">10.       Also it appears improbable that a person would give Rs.2 lakhs to

another person inspite of having given two cheques of Rs.1 lakh each on prior

occasions and would not demand his cheques back. It is also not clear as to

why the accused did not take any step to avoid misuse of cheques if he had

given the amount in cash to the complainant later.
</p>
<p id="p_10">


</p><p id="p_11">11.       The accused as also deposed that he had given blank signed cheques



CC No. 3732/16                6/7    Sultan Singh vs. Sunil Tandon
 to the complainant. However, it is not clear as to why the accused did not fill

the amount on the cheques in question if he was supposed to give only a

specific amount to the complainant. The accused has also deposed that the

cash amount given by him to the complainant was also not returned. However,

the accused has not given any particulars of the date on which the cheque as

well as the cash amount were given by him to the complainant nor has he

initiated any action to secure repayment of his amount. This demolishes the

plea of defence taken by the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_12">


</p><p id="p_13">12.       Hence, it can be inferred that accused has failed to probabilise his

defence. Accordingly, I hold that accused has failed to discharge his burden to

rebut the presumption. Hence, I return the finding of 'guilty' against the

accused. Accused Sunil Tandon stands convicted of offence u/s 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_13">N.I. Act</a>.

Copy of the judgment be given free of cost to the convict.
