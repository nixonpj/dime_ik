             BRIEF REASONS FOR THE DECISION OF THE CASE

</p><p id="p_3">1.                   The case of the prosecution is that on 11.04.2006 at 06.40AM at
near Iscon Temple, New Delhi within the jurisdiction of PS Lajpat Nagar, he
was found in possession of one buttondar knife without any permit or licence
in contravention of notification issued by the Delhi Administration Delhi by


FIR No.352/2006                                                                                               PS Lajpat Nagar
                                                             Page 2  of 6                       State  Vs.  Rohit @ Bunty 

the police while they were on patrolling duty. Accused was arrested and
investigation was carried out. Upon investigation and completion of other
formalities, present challan was filed in the court by the IO.
</p>

<p id="p_4">2.                   Copies of documents were supplied to the accused. Vide order
dated 10.01.2008 learned predecessor Court framed a charge punishable for
the offence under <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_3">Section 25</a> Arms Act, 1959 against the accused to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
</p>

<p id="p_5">3.                   Prosecution has cited 06 witnesses in the list of witnesses
appended to the challan and out of them, only three witnesses were examined.
In view of the reasons mentioned in the order sheet dated 02.03.2013,
prosecution evidence has been closed. After conclusion of prosecution
evidence, the statement of accused under <a href="/doc/224316/" id="a_4">Section 281</a> Cr. P.C. has also been
recorded on 02.03.2013 wherein he pleaded innocence, however he has not
led any evidence in the defence.
</p>

<p id="p_6">4.                   I have heard arguments of Sh Mayank Tripathi, learned Assistant
Public Prosecutor and learned counsel for accused and have also perused the
record very carefully.
</p>

<p id="p_7">5.                   To prove its case prosecution examined the recovery witness.
</p>

<p id="p_8">6.                   PW1 Constable N Kishan witness of recovery who deposed on
the identical lines as per the prosecution case. It is deposed by the witness


FIR No.352/2006                                                                                               PS Lajpat Nagar
                                                             Page 3  of 6                       State  Vs.  Rohit @ Bunty 

that on 11.04.2006 he was on patrolling duty alongwith PW2 Constable
Naresh and were present in the area of Garhi, near Iscon Temple, East of
Kailash, at about 06.40AM, they noticed one person while passing through
the Jungle, behind Iscon Temple. They saw the accused, who started running
after seeing them. Accused was searched wherein one buttondar knife was
recovered from him and on enquiry the name of that person was revealed as
Rohit @ Bunty. The information was conveyed at PP Garhi from where
PW3 ASI Satvinder Singh arrived and recorded the statement of this witness.
The sketch of knife was prepared as Ex.PW1/A. The knife was measured and
pullanda thereof was prepared and sealed with the seal of SS. After use, seal
was handed over by the IO to this witness. The pullanda of knife was seized
vide seizure memo Ex.PW1/B. IO ASI Satvinder Singh prepared rukka and
got the case FIR registered at PS through Constable Naresh.                                                            Upon
registration of FIR, PW2 returned at the spot and handed over the copy of FIR
and original rukka to the IO, who prepared the site plan Ex.PW1/D at instance
of PW1. Accused was arrested and his personal search memo was conducted
vide memos Ex.PW1/E and Ex.PW1/F respectively. Accused was sent to
Lock up after his medical examination and case property was deposited in the
Malkhana. He has identified the accused and case property as well.
</p>

<p id="p_9">7.                   PW2 Constable Naresh has deposed on the similar lines as that
of PW1. PW3 ASI Satvinder Singh is the Investigating Officer and has
deposed regarding the steps taken during the investigation of this case.
</p>

<p id="p_10">8.                   I have gone through the entire set of evidence and on its perusal I


FIR No.352/2006                                                                                               PS Lajpat Nagar

find that there are major contradictions in the case in hand and the evidence
adduced by the prosecution does not prove the case against the accused
beyond reasonable doubt.
</p>

<p id="p_11">9.                   Firstly, it is observed that PW1 and PW2 had deposed in their
deposition that accused had been apprehended with knife, while they were on
patrolling duty. Also, if the police personnel who has apprehended the
accused with the knife was on checking duty, prosecution should have
brought the relevant records showing his arrival and departure and should
have proved by documentary evidence that he was on patrolling duty by
producing DD entry for the same.
</p>

<p id="p_12">10.                  As per Chapter 22 Rule 49 of the Punjab Police Rules, which is
reproduced as under;
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                     "Chapter 22 rule 49 Matters to be entered in Register
                     no. II. The following matters shall amongst others, be
                     entered:(c) The hour of arrival and departure on duty
                     at or from a police station of all enrolled police officers
                     of whatever rank, whether posted at the police station
                     or elsewhere, with a statement of the nature of their
                     duty. This entry shall be made immediately on arrival
                     or prior to the departure of the officer concerned and
                     shall be attested by the latter personally by signature or
                     seal.

                     such as Police Lines and Police Posts where Register
                     No. II is maintained.</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">          In view of this rule, while deposing none of the prosecution witnesses
has told that who and by what entry in the register no. II, they were patrolling


FIR No.352/2006                                                                                               PS Lajpat Nagar
                                                             Page 5  of 6                       State  Vs.  Rohit @ Bunty 

in the particular area.
</p>

<p id="p_14">11.                  In the present case also this provision has not been complied
with by the prosecution witnesses. The relevant entries regarding the arrival
and departure of the police officials has not been proved on record. It has
been held in Rattan Lal Vs. State 1987(2) Crimes 29 the Hon'ble Delhi Hgih
Court held that;-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                     "wherein it has been observed that if the investigating
                     agency deliberately ignores to comply with the
                     provisions of the Act the Courts will have to approach
                     their action with reservations. The matter has to be
                     viewed with suspicion if the provisions of law are not
                     strictly complied with and the least that can be said is
                     that it is so done with an oblique motive. This failure to
                     bring on record, the DD entries creates a reasonable
                     doubt in the prosecution version and attributes oblique
                     motive on the part of the prosecution."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_15">12.                  The recovery witnesses PW1 &amp; PW2 during cross-examination
admitted that he apprehended the accused and at that time, public persons
were there even at the bus stop, but they refused to join the investigation on
the asking and have left the spot without disclosing their names and
addresses. In this regard the following judgments are of immense help.
</p><p id="p_16">        In the State of Rajasthan Vs. Teja Singh 2001 (II) AD (SC) 125,
        Hon'ble supreme Court held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                             "The failure of the prosecution to examine
                         independent witnesses though available is fatal for
                         their case".

RCR (DB) 646, Roop chand Vs. State of Haryana : 1989 (2) RCR 504 and
State of Punjab Vs. Sukhdev Singh : 1992 (3) RCR 311, it was held by the
Hon'ble courts that :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                          "Where the IO has failed to even note down the
                         names and address of the persons, who have refused
                         to join as public witnesses, couple with the fact that no
                         action was taken against them, the case is rendered
                         doubtful."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">14.                  Thus the above testimonies/contradictions create dent in the
version of the prosecution resulting in accrual of the benefit of doubt to the
accused. The prosecution version does not inspire any confidence. Thus, the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove this case, much less beyond
reasonable doubt. As such, accused Rohit @ Bunty is acquitted for the
offence punishable under <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_5">Section 25</a> Arms Act.
