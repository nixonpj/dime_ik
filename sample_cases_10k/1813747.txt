Damages-Breach	 of  contract.-Sale  of	  goods-Measure	  of
damages-Foreseeable   consequence  of  breach-Knowledge	  of
parties-<a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_1">Indian Contract Act</a>, 1872 (9 of 1872),<a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_2"> s. 73</a>.



HEADNOTE:
The  appellant entered into a contract with  the  respondent
for the sale of certain canvas at Re. 1 per yard under which
the  delivery  was to be made through  railway	receipt	 for
Calcutta  for Kanpur.  The cost of transport from Kanpur  to
Calcutta  and the labour charges in that connection were  to
be  borne  by  the respondent and it  was  agreed  that	 the
railway	 receipt would be delivered on August 5, 1947.	 The
appellant  was unable to deliver the railway receipt on	 the
due date because booking from Kanpur to Calcutta was closed,
and,  therefore,  cancelled the	 contract.   The  respondent
instituted a suit for the recovery of damages for the breach
of the contract and claimed that as the seller knew that the
goods  were  to be sent to Calcutta and	 must  therefore  be
presumed  to know that the goods would be sold in  Calcutta,
any  loss  of  profit  to  the	buyer  resulting  from	 the
difference  between the rate in Calcutta on the date of	 the
breach	and  the  contract  rate would	be  the	 measure  of
damages.
Held:	  (1)	that  it  is  well  settled  that  the	 two
principles  relating  to  compensation for  loss  or  damage
caused	by breach of contract as laid down in<a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_3"> s. 73</a>  Of	 the
Indian	Contract  Act,	1872,  read  with  the	 Explanation
thereof, are (i) that, as far as possible, he who has proved
a breach of a bargain to supply what he contracted to get is
to  be	placed,	 as far as money can do it,  in	 as  good  a
situation  as if the contract had been performed,  but	(ii)
that  there is a duty on him of taking all reasonable  steps
to mitigate the loss consequent on the breach and debars him
from  claiming	any part of the damage which is due  to	 his
neglect to take such steps.
British	 Westinghouse  Electric and  Manufacturing  Company,
Limited	 v. Underground Electric Railway Company of  London,
[1912] A.C. 673, relied on.
(2)  that the contract in the present case was for  delivery
for.   Kanpur in which it was open to the buyer to sell	 the
goods  where it liked, and no inference could be drawn	from
the mere fact that goods were to be booked for Calcutta that
the  seller knew that the goods were for resale in  Calcutta
only.  The contract was therefore not of the special type to
which the words "which the parties knew, when they made	 the
contract,
654
to  be likely to result from the breach of it" appearing  in
s. 73 of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_4">Indian Contract Act</a>, 1872, would apply, but  an
ordinary contract, for which the measure of damages would be
such as "naturally arose in the usual course of things	from
such  breach"  within  the meaning  of	that  section.	 The
damages would be the difference between the market price  in
Kanpur on the date of breach and the contract price.  But as
the  respondent	 bad failed to prove the  rate	for  similar
canvas in Kanpur on the date of breach, it was not  entitled
to  any damages as there was no measure for arriving at	 the
quantum.

JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No.193 of 1958.
Appeal	by special leave from the judgment and decree  dated
October	 3,  1955, of the High Court of	 Judicature,  Madhya
Bharat, Indore, in Civil First Appeal No. 58 of 1952.
C.   B. Aggarwala and Bhagwan Das Jain, for the appellant.
Radhey	Lal Aggarwal and A. G. Ratnaparkhi,  for  respondent
No. 1.
</p><p id="p_2">1961.  March 29.  The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
WANCHOO,  J.-This  is an appeal by special  leave  from	 the
judgment  of  the High Court of Madhya Bharat.	A  suit	 was
filed by firm Messrs.  Harishchandra Dwarkadas	(hereinafter
called	the respondent) against the  appellant-firm  Messrs.
Murlidhar  Chiranjilal	and one Babulal.  The  case  of	 the
respondent was that a contract had been entered into between
the appellant and the respondent through Babulal for sale of
certain	 canvas at Re.	I per yard.  The delivery was to  be
made  through railway receipt for Calcutta f. o. r.  Kanpur.
The cost of transport from Kanpur to Calcutta and the labour
charges	 in  that  connection  were  to	 be  borne  by	 the
respondent.   It  was also agreed that the  railway  receipt
would be delivered on August 5, 1947.  The appellant however
failed to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">655</span>
deliver	 the railway receipt and informed the respondent  on
August 8, 1947, that as booking from Kanpur to Calcutta	 was
closed	the contract had become impossible  of	performance;
consequently  the  appellant  cancelled	 the  contract	 and
returned the advance that had been received.  The respondent
did  not accept that the contract had become  impossible  of
performance and informed the appellant that it had committed
a  breach  of the contract and was thus liable	in  damages.
After  further exchange of notices between the parties,	 the
present suit was filed in November, 1947.
</p><p id="p_3">Written	 statements  were filed both by	 the  appellant	 and
Babulal.   The contention of Babulal was that  the  contract
had  become  incapable	of  performance	 and  was  therefore
rightly	 rescinded.  Further Babulal contended that  he	 was
not in any case liable to pay any damages.  The appellant on
the other hand denied all knowledge of the contract and	 did
not  admit that it was liable to pay any  damages.   Certain
other  pleas were raised by the appellant with which we	 are
however not concerned in the present appeal.
Three	main  questions	 arose	for  determination  on	 the
pleadings of the parties.  The first was whether Babulal had
acted  as  agent  of the appellant in  the  matter  of	this
contract;  the	second was whether the contract	 had  become
impossible of performance because the booking of goods	from
Kanpur to Calcutta was stopped; and the last was whether the
respondent  was entitled to damages at the rate	 claimed  by
it.
</p><p id="p_4">The trial court held that Babulal had acted as the agent  of
the  appellant	in  the	 matter	 of  the  contract  and	 the
appellant  was therefore bound by it.  It further hold	that
the  contract had become impossible of performance.   Lastly
it hold that it was the respondent's duty when the appellant
had  failed  to	 perform the contract to buy  the  goods  in
Kanpur	and  the  respondent had failed to  prove  the	rate
prevalent  in  Kanpur  on the date of  the  breach  (namely,
August	5,  1947)  and therefore was  not  entitled  to	 any
damages.  On this view the suit was dismissed.
The respondent went in appeal to the High Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">656</span>
and  the two main questions that arose there were about	 the
impossibility  of  the performance of the contract  and	 the
liability of the appellant for damages.	 The High Court held
that  the contract had not become impossible of	 performance
as  it had not been proved that the booking  between  Kanpur
and  Calcutta was closed at the relevant time.	 It  further
held  that  the respondent was entitled to  damages  on	 the
basis  of  the	rate prevalent in Calcutta on  the  date  of
breach and after making certain deductions decreed the	suit
for  Rs. 16,946.  Thereupon there was an application by	 the
appellant  for a certificate to appeal to this Court,  which
was  rejected.	This was followed by an application to	this
Court  for special leave which was granted; and that is	 how
the matter has come up before us.
</p><p id="p_5">The same two questions which were in dispute before the High
Court have been raised before us on behalf of the appellant.
We  think it unnecessary to decide whether the contract	 had
become	impossible  of performance, as we have come  to	 the
conclusion  that the appeal must succeed on the other  point
raised	on behalf of the appellant.  The necessary facts  in
that connection are these: The contract was to be  performed
by  delivery  of  railway receipt f. o.	 r.  Kanpur  by	 the
appellant to the respondent on August 5, 1947.	This was not
done  and  therefore there was undoubtedly a breach  of	 the
contract  on that date.	 The question therefore that  arises
is  whether the respondent has proved the damages  which  it
claims	to be entitled to for the breach.  The	respondent's
evidence  on  this  point was that it  proved  the  rate  of
coloured  canvas  in Calcutta on or about the  date  of	 the
breach.	 This rate was Rs. 1-8-3 per yard and the respondent
claimed	 that  it was therefore entitled to damages  at	 the
rate  of  Re. 0-8-3 per yard, as the contract  rate  settled
between the parties was R.s. 1 per yard,
The  quantum  of damages in a case of this kind	 has  to  be
determined under<a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_5"> s. 73</a> of the Contract Act, No. IX of  1872.
The relevant part of it is as follows:-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">657</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "When  a contract has been broken,  the  party
	      who  suffers  by such breach  is	entitled  to
	      receive,	from  the party who has	 broken	 the
	      contract, compensation for any loss or  damage
	      caused  to him thereby, which naturally  arose
	      in  the  usual  course  of  things  from	such
	      breach,  or which the parties knew, when	they
	      made the contract, to be likely to result from
	      the breach of it......
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      "	  Explanation-In  estimating  the  loss	  or
	      damage arising from a breach of contract,	 the
	      means   which   existed	of   remedying	 the
	      inconvenience caused by the non-performance of
	      the contract must be taken into account."
</blockquote><p id="p_6">The  contention	 on  behalf of the  appellant  is  that	 the
contract was for delivery f. o. r. Kanpur and the respondent
had  therefore	to prove the rate of  plain  (not  coloured)
canvas	at  Kanpur  on or about the date  of  breach  to  be
entitled  to any damages at all.  The respondent  admittedly
has  not proved the rate of such canvas prevalent in  Kanpur
on  or	about the date of breach and therefore	it  was	 not
entitled to any damages at all, for there is no measure	 for
arriving  at  the quantum of damages on the record  in	this
case.	Where goods are available in the market, it  is	 the
difference  between  the  market price on the  date  of	 the
breach	and  the  contract price which	is  the	 measure  of
damages.  The appellant therefore contends that as it is not
the  case  of  the respondent that similar  canvas  was	 not
available  in the market at Kanpur on or about the (late  of
breach, it was the duty of the respondent to buy the  canvas
in  Kanpur and rail it for Calcutta and if it  suffered	 any
damage because of the rise in price over the contract  price
on  that account it would be entitled to such damages.	 But
it has failed to prove the rate of similar canvas in  Kanpur
on the relevant date.  There is thus no way in which it	 can
be  found  that the respondent suffered any  damage  by	 the
breach of this contract.
</p><p id="p_7">The  two  principles  on which damages	in  such  cases	 are
calculated  are well-settled.  The first is that, as far  as
possible, he who has proved a breach of a bargain .
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">83</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">658</span>
<p id="p_8">to supply what he contracted to get is to be placed, as	 far
as  money  can	do  it, in as good a  situation	 as  if	 the
contract had been performed; but this principle is qualified
by a second, which imposes on a plaintiff the duty of taking
all reasonable step" to mitigate the loss consequent on	 the
breach, and debars him from claiming any part of the  damage
which  is  due to his neglect to take such  steps:  (British
Westinghouse  Electric and Manufacturing Company Limited  v.
Underground Electric Railways Company of London (1)).  These
two  principles also follow from the law as laid down in <a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_6"> s.
73</a>  read  with	the Explanation	 thereof  If  therefore	 the
contract   was	to  be	performed  at  Kanpur  it  was	 the
respondent's  duty to buy the goods in Kanpur and rail	them
to Calcutta on the date of the breach and if it suffered any
damage	thereby because of the rise in price on the date  of
the  breach as -compared to the contract price, it would  be
entitled  to  be  reimbursed  for the  loss.   Even  if	 the
respondent did not actually buy them in the market at Kanpur
on  the	 date of breach it would be entitled to	 damages  on
proof of the rate for similar canvas prevalent in Kanpur  on
the  date of breach, if that rate was above  the  contracted
rate  resulting in loss to it.	Bat the respondent  did	 not
make  any  attempt  to prove the  rate	for  similar  canvas
prevalent  in  Kanpur on the date of breach.   Therefore  it
would  obviously be not entitled to any damages at all,	 for
on this state of the evidence it could not be said that	 any
damage naturally arose in the usual course of things.
But  the learned counsel for the respondent relies  on	that
part  of<a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_7"> s. 73</a> which says that dam-ages may be	measured  by
what  the  parties knew when they made the  contract  to  be
likely	to  result from the breach of it.  It  is  contended
that  the contract clearly showed that the goods were to  be
transported to and sold in Calcutta and therefore it was the
price in Calcutta which would have to be taken into  account
in  arriving at the measure of damages for the parties	knew
when  they made the contract that the goods were to be	sold
in Calcutta.  Reliance in this connection is placed on
(1)  [1912] A.C. 673. 689.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">659</span>
<p id="p_9">two  cases, the first of which is Re.  R. and H.  Hall	Ltd.
and  W.	 H. Pim (Junior) &amp; Co.'s Arbitration (1).   In	that
case  it  was held that damages recoverable' by	 the  buyers
should	not be limited merely to the difference between	 the
contract  price and the market price on the date  of  breach
but  should include both the buyers' own loss of  profit  on
the  resale and the damages for which they would  be  liable
for  their  breach of the contract of resale,  because	such
damages	 must reason ably be supposed to have been  -in	 the
contemplation  of the parties at the time the  contract	 was
made  since the contract itself expressly provided for	are-
sale  before delivery, and because the parties knew that  it
was not unlikely that such resale would occur.	'That was  a
case  where the seller sold unspecified cargo of  Australian
wheat  at a fixed price.  The contract provided that  notice
of  appropriation to the contract of a specific cargo  in  a
specific  ship should be given within a specified  time	 and
also contained express provisions as to what should be	done
in  various circumstances if the cargo should be resold	 one
or  more times before delivery.	 That was thus a case  of  a
special	 type  in which both buyers and seller knew  at	 the
time  the  contract was made that there was an	even  chance
that  the buyers could resell the cargo before delivery	 and
not retain it themselves.
</p><p id="p_10">The  second  case on which reliance was placed	is  Victoria
Laundry (Windsor) Ltd. v. Newman Industries Ltd, (2)..	That
was  a case of a boiler being sold to a laundry and  it	 was
held that damages for loss of profit were recoverable if  it
was apparent to the defendant as reasonable persons that the
delay  in  delivery was liable to lead to such loss  to	 the
plaintiffs.  These two cases exemplify that provision of <a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_8"> s.
73</a>  of the Contract Act, which provides that the measure  of
damages	 in  certain circumstances may be what	the  parties
knew when they made the contract to be likely to result from
the breach of it.  But they are cases of a special type;  in
one  case the parties knew that goods purchased were  likely
to  be resold before delivery and therefore any loss by	 the
breach of contract eventually

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">660</span>
<p id="p_12">may  include loss that may have been suffered by the  buyers
because	 of the failure to honour the intermediate  contract
of  resale  made  by  them; in	the  other  the	 goods	were
purchased by the party for his own business for a particular
purpose	 which the sellers were expected to know and if	 any
loss resulted from the delay in the supply the sellers would
be  liable  for that loss also, if they had  knowledge	that
such loss was likely to result.
</p><p id="p_13">The question is whether the present is a case like these two
cases at all.  It is urged on behalf of the respondent	that
the seller knew that the goods were to be sent to  Calcutta;
therefore it should be presumed to know that the goods would
be  sold  in Calcutta and any loss of profit  to  the  buyer
resulting  from the difference between the rate in  Calcutta
on the date of the breach and the contract rate would be the
measure of damages.  Now there is no dispute that the  buyer
had purchased canvas in this case for resale; but we  cannot
infer  from the mere fact that the goods were to  be  booked
for  Calcutta that the seller knew that the goods  were	 for
resale	in Calcutta only.  As a matter of fact it cannot  be
denied	that it was open to the buyer in this case  to	sell
the railway receipt as soon at it was received in Kanpnr and
there can be no inference from the mere fact that the  goods
were  to be sent to Calcutta that they were meant  only	 for
sale in Calcutta.  It was open to the buyer to sell them any
where  it liked.  Therefore this is not a case where it	 can
be  said that the parties knew when they made  the  contract
that  the  goods were meant for sale in Calcutta  alone	 and
thus  the  difference between the price in Calcutta  at	 the
date  of  the  breach and the contract price  would  be	 the
measure	 of  damages as the likely result from	the  breach.
The contract was for delivery for Kanpur and was an ordinary
contract in which it was open to the buyer to sell the goods
where it liked.
</p><p id="p_14">	      We  may  in  this	 connection  refer  to	 the
	      following	 observations in Chao and others  v.
	      British  Traders and Shippers Ltd. (1),  which
	      are,  apposite  to the facts  of	the  present
	      case:
</p><p id="p_15">	      (1)   [1954] 1 All E.R. 779,797.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">	      661</span>
<p id="p_16">	      "It is true that the defendants knew that	 the
	      plaintiffs were merchants and, therefore,	 had
	      bought for resale, but every one who sells  to
	      a	 merchant knows that he has bought for	are-
	      sale,  and  it does not, as I  understand	 it,
	      make any difference to the ordinary measure of
	      damages  where  there is a  market.   What  is
	      contemplated  is	that the merchant  buys	 for
	      are-sale, but, if the goods are not  delivered
	      to him, he will go out into the market and buy
	      similar goods and honour his contract in	that
	      way.   If	 the market has fallen	he  has	 not
	      suffered	any damage, if the market has  risen
	      the  measure of damages is the  difference  in
	      the market price."
</p><p id="p_17">In  these circumstances this is not a case where it  can  be
said that the parties when they made the contract knew	that
the  likely result of breach would be that the	buyer  would
not  be able to make profit in Calcutta.  This is  a  simple
case of purchase of goods for resale anywhere and  therefore
the  measure of damages has to be calculated as	 they  would
naturally  arise  in the usual course of  things  from	such
breach.	  That	means that the respondent had to  prove	 the
market	rate  at Kanpur on the date of	breach	for  similar
goods and that would fix the amount of damages, in case that
rate  had  gone	 above the contract rate  on  the  (late  of
breach.	 We are therefore of opinion that this is not a case
of  the special type to which the words "which	the  parties
knew,  when they made the contract, to be likely  to  result
from  the breach of it" appearing in<a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_9"> s. 73</a> of  the  Contract
Act  apply.  This is ,in ordinary case of  contract  between
traders which is covered by the words "which naturally arose
in the usual course of things from such breach" appearing in
s.  73.	 As the respondent had failed to prove the rate	 for
similar	 canvas	 in Kanpur on the date of breach it  is	 not
entitled to any damages in the circumstances.  The appeal is
therefore  allowed, the decree of the High Court  set  aside
and of the trial court restored with costs to the  appellant
throughout.
