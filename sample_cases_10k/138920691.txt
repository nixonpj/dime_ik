                        M.Cr.C.No.37896/2018




             High Court of Madhya Pradesh.

          (Bharat Singh Sakhwar Vs. State of M.P.)
Gwalior dated, 09.10.2018
     Shri D.K. Sharma, learned counsel for the petitioner.
     Shri R.N. Sharma, learned public prosecutor for the
respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Appearing counsel for the parties are heard on alleged
first anticipatory bail petition filed u/S 438 of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a> before
this court, in relation to Crime No. 369/2018 registered at Police
Station      Ambah, Distt. Morena, in reference to offence
punishable u/Ss. 354 and 456 of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a> and the produced
case diary      and the documents filed with application are
perused.
</p><p id="p_2">      Petitioner's anticipatory bail petition has already been
dismissed by the     First   Additional Sessions Judge, Ambah,
District Morena, vide order dated 06.09. 2018, whose certified
copy is annexed with the application under consideration.
</p><p id="p_3">      Appearing counsel for the petitioner placing reliance on
documents filed in support of petition contends that petitioner is
presently working as Assistant Teacher in Shaskiye Primary
School Khokhalpur and he has left his old house, and started
living in a new house which is about 2 kms away from his old
house thereafter his old house has been illegally possessed by
complainant and some other persons and that on 20.7. 2018 he
objected to it. Complainant lady threatened him that she would
falsely implicate him in a case of rape and previously regarding
this threatening he has submitted applications       dated 23. 7.
2018 to S.D.O., Ambah and S.P., Morena whose copies are
also annexed and thereafter on 10.8.2018 a false report by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                                     2</span>
                                                                          M.Cr.C.No.37896/2018




         complainant has been lodged that petitioner entered into house
         of the complainant lady in the mid night and caught hold his
         hand and pressed his mouth. It is also contended that there is
         no possibility of his fleeing from justice and he is ready to
         comply with the conditions to be imposed by the court,
         therefore, it is prayed that benefit of anticipatory bail                                               be
         provided to him.
</p><p id="p_4">                     Per contra, above mentioned prayer has been strongly
         opposed by the appearing public prosecutor on grounds that
         complainant lady has lodged FIR against petitioner Bharat and
         co-accused Ramdas and in medical examination conducted on
         10.8.2018, an abrasion injury has been found on the body of the
         complainant                               lady and complainant's                        statement has been
         recorded u/s. 164 of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3">Cr.P.C</a> on 21.8. 2018 before the
         relating JMFC, therefore, dismissal of the anticipatory bail
         petition is prayed.
</p><p id="p_5">                     Having heard the rival contentions raised by the counsel
         for the parties, without commenting on the merits of the case,
         and in view of the MLC of the complainant, petitioner's case
         does not appear fit for granting him benefit of anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_6">                     Consequently, anticipatory bail petition filed on behalf of
         petitioner is dismissed. Case diary be returned.</p><pre id="pre_2">
