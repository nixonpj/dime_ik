deceased has been placed on record. Therefore, income of the deceased is assessed
as per the minimum wages of unskilled worker in U.P. on the date of accident i.e
Rs. 165.5 per day.
</p><p id="p_14">          As per the ration card Ex. P1 the age of the deceased was 40 years. As per
Postmortem report, the age of deceased was 45 years therefore, the age of the

15/05/2015 it has been held that multiplier is to be used with reference to the age
of the deceased. It was further held that 50% of the deduction is to be made in
case of bachelor. On the aspect of future prospects, it was also held that in case of
self employed persons also, if the deceased is below 40 years, there must be
addition of 50% to the actual income of the deceased while computing future
prospects.

is 14. In the present case there are 3 petitioners, the petitioner no. 1 is wife of
deceased, petitioner no. 2 is daughter &amp; petitioner no. 3 is mother of deceased.
Deceased therefore, had 3 dependents so, 1/3rd is deducted towards personal
expenses. Therefore, the total loss of dependency would be calculated as follows :

             Respondent no.3 being insurance company in its written statement has
admitted that the offending vehicle was insured with them for the period from
12/09/2011 to 11/09/2012 in the name of respondent no. 2 bearing policy No.
3003/54890475/03/000. Respondent no. 3 has led evidence of R3W1 Sh. Gautam
Bhatnagar. As per the Insurance Co. respondent no. 1 was not having valid licence
to drive the offending vehicle and on verification it was found that the licence was
not issued from the Licensing Authority, Meerut, U.P. Even notice u/o 12 rule 8
CPC was served upon the owner but despite that the original licence of the driver
has not been produced on record. Ld. counsel for respondent no. 1 and 2 has also
cross-examined R3W1 and thus, respondent no. 1 and 2 were aware about the fact
that original licence was required to be produced but still licence has not been
placed on record. A report Ex. R3W1/5 has been received from the licensing
authority directly by post in which it is clearly deposed that no such licence was
issued in the name of Mukeem S/o Aslam. Also in the photocopy of licence
available on record name of driver is Mukeem but the name of respondent no. 1 in
the present petition is Mukarram. In the WS filed by respondent no. 1 and 2 also
the respondent no. 1 has signed as Mukarram and not as Mukeem. The affidavit
of respondent no. 1 filed alongwith the WS is also in the name of Mukarram S/o
Aslam. If the name of respondent no. 1 is Mukarram then how he has obtained
licence in the name of Mukeem also remained unexplained on the part of the
respondents. Once, report was received from the licensing authority and the legal
notice u/o 12 rule 8 CPC was sent to the owner onus has shifted upon respondent
no. 1 and 2 to prove that the respondent no. 1 had valid licence to drive the

                                                                            Kiran Bansal

MACT No. 477/11                                                                 Page 5/7
 offending vehicle on the date of accident but as no rebuttal evidence has been led
by respondent no. 1 and 2 evidence led by Insurance Co. is to be relied upon and
in view of the report Ex. R3W1/5 it is proved that respondent no. 1 did not had a
valid driving licence to drive the vehicle on the date of accident.

<p id="p_20">        Therefore, insurance co. / respondent no. 3 is entitled to recovery rights.
