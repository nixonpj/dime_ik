                 CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE BIRENDRA PRASAD VERMA

</p>
<p id="p_2">2   10-12-2014                Heard the parties.
</p><p id="p_3">                              The petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated
                 19.08.2013 (Annexure-4) as also the order dated 27.08.2013
                 (Annexure-6), both issued under the signature of the respondent
                 Superintending Engineer (respondent no.5), whereby a direction
                 has been issued to recover extra amount paid to the petitioner in
                 30 instalments.
</p><p id="p_4">                              Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner
                 submits that the petitioner is suffering from cancer, therefore,
                 sympathetic view may be taken and the impugned orders may be
                 set aside. However, despite repeated queries, he has not been able
                 to show any legal infirmity or procedural irregularity or violation
                 of any statute with respect to the impugned orders as contained in
                 Annexures- 4 and 6.

<p id="p_5">                                      Learned Standing Counsel No. 29, appearing on
                       behalf of the respondents, by referring the averments made in the
                       counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent no.5 has
                       strongly opposed the prayer and has supported the impugned
                       orders. It is contended by him that the orders impugned have been
                       passed strictly in accordance with law and inconsonance with the
                       judicial pronouncements of this Court as also the Hon'ble
                       Supreme Court.
</p><p id="p_6">                                      After having heard the parties and in view of the fact
                       that the learned counsel for the petitioner has not been able to
                       point out any legal infirmity with respect to the orders impugned,
                       this Court is not inclined to accede to the prayer made on behalf of
                       the petitioner. If the petitioner is suffering from cancer, this Court
                       may have sympathy for him but on the ground of his ailment, he
                       cannot be permitted to devour the public money. The tax payers
                       money cannot be permitted to be misappropriated by any person
                       on any ground, not even on the ground of illness. Recently, the
                       Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/158997795/" id="a_1">Union of India vs. G.R.Rama
                       Krishna</a> [(2013) 12 SCC 582] has denounced judicial sympathy
                       resulting into a right in favour of a person contrary to the statutory
                       Rules.
</p><p id="p_7">                                      For the reasons recorded above, the writ petition has
                       to fail and is, accordingly, dismissed, but without costs.
