<pre id="pre_1">     THE HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE CHALLA KODANDA RAM

  WRIT PETITIONS No. 1803, 4377, 4550, 4651, 4731, 4758,
 4763, 4837, 4873, 5330, 5341, 5348 of 2019, 35625, 20487,
             36699, 39712 and 43099 OF 2018

COMMON ORDER:

         All these Writ Petitions raise a common question of law and

fact. Hence, they are being disposed of through this order.

         Essentially, the petitioners in all these cases are the

purchasers of motor vehicles (high-end and expensive cars), like

BMW, Bentley, Maruti Ertiga, etc. While the petitioners submit

that they had purchased them at ex-show room price which is

reflected in the invoices, the respondent authorities assert that in</pre>

<p id="p_1">terms of the list price of the dealer, life tax is to be paid under the

provisions of the Telangana Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1963.

</p><p id="p_2">      At the outset, it may be noted that the issue raised in these

Writ Petitions is no more res integra and is settled by the judgment

of the learned Single Judge in Writ Petition No. 5286 of 2018,

dated 02.05.2018, as confirmed by the Division Bench            in its

judgment, dated 29.01.2019 in Writ Appeal No. 805 of 2018 and

batch.      Notwithstanding   the   said   two   judgments,    learned

Government Pleader for Transport, in his anxiety to protect the

State exchequer and to add revenue to the coffers, would venture

to submit that the matter requires rehearing.        Considering the

genuine efforts being made by the learned Government Pleader,

this Court, once again, has heard the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_3">         The contention of the learned Government Pleader, in brief,

is that the individual dealers, with respect to the same product,

have been giving different invoices with varied price and peculiarly,

the dealers are not showing the list price and the discount, if any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>




that is being offered. In the absence of the same, the list price,

which is being projected, is the price required to be taken for the

purpose of taxation, as, the tax is payable under Section 3 of the

1963 Act, as amended by Act 11 of 2010, contends the learned

Government Pleader. It is his further contention that in terms of

Schedule VI (as amended by Act 11 of 2010), tax is to be paid as a

percentage of the 'cost of the vehicle'. The dealers by artificially

showing lesser price than the list price are enabling evasion or

avoiding the tax which is justly due to the State. It is his assertion

that for the same product, i.e. motor vehicle, on account of varying

invoice price charged by the dealer, tax is being paid by the

individuals differently which results in invidious discrimination

against the citizens by the dealers.       The learned Government

Pleader places reliance on the judgments of the Supreme Court in

<a href="/doc/170080654/" id="a_1">Commissioner of Income Tax v. P.J. Chemicals Limited1</a>,

<a href="/doc/682543/" id="a_2">Collector of Central Excise v. Dai Ichi Karkaria Limited2 and

the Cost Accounting Standards</a> issued by ICAI (earlier ICWAI).

</p><p id="p_4">          On the other hand, learned counsel for the petitioners, in

unison, opposed the arguments of the learned Government Pleader

and assert that since the matter is covered by the judgment of the

Division Bench, if at all the respondents are aggrieved thereby,

they either need to carry the matter in Appeal or, for any valid

reasons, if it requires review, they can, at best, file a Review

Petition before the Division Bench, hence, submits, the arguments

of the learned Government Pleader ought to be rejected in limine.

</p><p id="p_5">          As stated supra, since the learned Government Pleader is

making sincere efforts to project an argument, patient audience is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">1</span>
    1994 Supp 3 SC 535
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">2</span>
    (1997) 7 SCC 448
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   3</span>




given to the same. Thereafter, having given anxious thought to the

said submissions, this Court does not find any reason to come to a

different conclusion than the one reached by the learned Single

Judge as well as the Division Bench.       The learned Single Judge

had elaborately dealt with respect to the interpretation that is

required to be given to the words 'cost of vehicle' as mentioned in

the Schedule with reference to certain settled principles.       While

selling of the vehicle by the dealer and purchase of the vehicle by

the individual like the petitioners is by way of a contract which is

governed by the law relating to sale of goods, under the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_3">Sale of

Goods Act</a>, there are specific rights enuring to the benefit of both

the seller and buyer. There is no dispute that under the earlier

State Sales Tax laws and now present integrated Goods and

Service Tax Act, in terms of Section 31 of GST Act, a tax invoice is

required to be issued by the dealer. Under the scheme of GST Act,

there is Central GST and also State GST apart from other levies, if

any by way of the special cess / surcharges. With respect to the

GST, it is calculated on the sale price reflected in the invoice. It is

not the case of the learned Government Pleader that the sale and

purchase of motor vehicles is governed by any other law and there

is no controlled price notified by the government. In other words,

so far as the cost of vehicle is concerned, it is not regulated, in any

manner, leaving it to the free choice of the buyer and seller. It may

also be noted that unlike under the erstwhile repealed <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_4">Central

Excise Act</a>, where there is a presumptive price, there is no

presumptive price so far as the sale and purchase of the motor

vehicles under the <a href="/doc/1474739/" id="a_5">Taxation Act</a>. It is also conceded by the learned

Government Pleader that neither there is mechanism nor power
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     4</span>




vests with the authority under the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_6">Motor Vehicles Act</a> / <a href="/doc/1152907/" id="a_7">Motor

Vehicles Taxation Act</a> to determine the cost of the vehicle which

would enable them to arrive at the cost of the vehicle, for the

purpose of <a href="/doc/1474739/" id="a_8">Taxation Act</a>. In those circumstances, the tax invoice

that was issued under the GST Act is the only available indicator

for the purpose of <a href="/doc/1152907/" id="a_9">Motor Vehicles Taxation Act</a> and the same is

being followed in all the States in all respects. The judgments of

the Supreme Court relied on by the learned Government Pleader in

P.J. Chemical's case and Dai Ichi Karkaria Limited's case are

not applicable as they do not relate to the issue of the nature

which is arising in the present Writ Petitions.

</p><p id="p_6">      The standards of Cost Accounting also have no relevance in

the present case as the said standards are relevant at the stage of

manufacturing, with respect to the manufacturer but not at the

stage of commodity being sold by the dealer and they operate

entirely a different field altogether.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      In those circumstances, reliance that is being placed on the

said regulations in the anxiety of the learned Government Pleader

is also misconceived and does not stand to scrutiny and it does not

require much further examination in the matter.

</p><p id="p_8">       In those circumstances, as the issue involved is squarely

covered by the judgment of the Division Bench and there being no

reason for this Court to come to a different conclusion altogether,

the Writ Petitions are allowed following the judgment of the

Division Bench with a further direction to the respondent

authorities to refund the excess tax amount wherever has been

paid in the absence of interim orders of this Court at the stage of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                     5</span>




admission, within four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of

this order. No costs.
</p>
<p id="p_9">           The miscellaneous Applications, if any pending shall stand

closed.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">                                        _____________________________
