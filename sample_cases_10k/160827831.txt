</p><p id="p_19">     10. It is well settled law that where petition under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_3">Section 166</a> of the Act is 

          instituted, it becomes the duty of the petitioner to establish rash and 

          negligent  driving.    To   prove   rash   and   negligent  driving   in   a  petition 

          under <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_4">Motor Vehicles Act</a>, Tribunal need not go into the technicality 

          because   strict   rules   of   procedure   and   evidence   are   not   followed. 

          Basically,   in   road   accident   cases,   Tribunal   is   simply   to   quantify   the 

          compensation  which  is just rational and  reasonable  on  the  basis of 

          inquiry.  The proceedings under <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_5">Motor Vehicles Act</a> are not akin to the 

          proceedings in a civil suit. Further, roving enquiry is not required to 

          prove the rashness and negligence on the part of the driver as has 

          been   held   in  Kaushumma   Begum   and   others   Vs.   New   India  

          Assurance Co. Ltd. 2001  ACJ 421 SC.

</p><p id="p_22">     11. To prove the negligence, the petitioner stepped into the witness box as 

          PW­1.  He stated that on 23.06.10 at about 5.30 AM he was going in 

          his TSR no. DL 1R G 7907 from B.P. Marg to Max Muller Marg.  When 

          he reached the crossing near Dayal Singh College, all of a sudden a 

          TATA   Indigo   car   bearing   no.   DL   3C   AY   0680   being   driven   by 

          respondent no.1 in a rash and negligent manner hit his TSR with great 

          force due to which he fell down on the road and sustained multiple 

          injuries.   He stated that a case was registered vide FIR 96/10  at the 

          police station Lodhi Colony.   He placed on record certified copies of 

          FIR, Site plan and proceedings of criminal case, which go to show that 

          the accident had occurred due to the negligence of the car driver i.e. 

          respondent no.1.   Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in case titled ''National 

          Insurance Company Limited V/s  Pushpa Rana''  reported as  2009 

          ACJ 287  has held that whenever criminal proceedings are placed on 

          record on completion of investigation by the police, then that in itself is 

          sufficient proof of the negligent driving of driver of the offending vehicle 

          involved in the accident.

          grievous   injuries   in   the   accident   which   occurred   due   to   rash   and 

          negligent   driving   of   offending   vehicle   by   respondent   no.1.     It   is   an 

          admitted fact on record that the vehicle was owned by respondent no.2 

          and it was insured with respondent no.3 insurance company.   Thus, 

          the issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioner and against the

          his head was planted in his stomach.   He remained admitted in the 

          hospital from 23.06.10 to 28.06.10.  He was again admitted on 29.06.10 

          and   discharged   on   the   same   day.     He   submitted   the   medical   bills 

          amounting to Rs. 2,100/­.   On going through the discharge summary, 

          medical papers and the bills, I find that the petitioner might have spent 

          much   more   on   his   medical   treatment.   Looking   into   the   injuries   and 

          facts and circumstances of the case I award a sum of  Rs. 5,000/­  to 

          the petitioner towards medical expenses.

          23.06.10 to 28.06.10.  He was again admitted on 29.06.10.   He had to 

          remain on bed for about 04 months. The injuries had given him lot of 

          pain and sufferings.  Looking into the injuries and the circumstances, I 

          award a sum of Rs. 25,000/­ towards pain and sufferings.

          attended the hospital as an outdoor patient.  He also took the help of 

          the attendant in his day­to­day work. The special diet was advised to 

          him   for   his   early   recovery.     Taking   into   consideration,   the   multiple 

          injuries and all the facts, I award a sum of Rs. 15,000/­ towards special 

          diet, conveyance and attendant charges.

          COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF INCOME :
</p><p id="p_37">     18. Although the petitioner has stated that at the time of accident he was 

          auto rickshaw driver and earning Rs. 10,000/­ per month but he did not 

          file any proof of income.  Medical record and the documents show that 

          he remained confined to bed for about 04 months.  Taking the wages 

          for a skilled person as on date of accident as per schedule i.e. Rs. 

          6,448/­ p.m.,   the total loss of income comes to Rs. 6,448 x 4 = Rs.
