<p id="p_1">2   18-06-2019                The present writ petition has been filed for quashing

                   the letter dated 02.05.2019 issued by the Registrar of the

                   respondent B.R.A. Bihar University addressed to the Nodal
 Patna High Court CWJC No.11684 of 2019(2) dt.18-06-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            2/3</span>




          Officer-cum-Registrar, Nalanda Open University, Patna, by

          which a request has been made to withhold the admission

          process of the petitioner college until the decision of the Eastern

          Regional Committee of the National Council for Teacher

          Education, pursuant to the letter written by the University to the

          NCTE.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                      The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the

          petitioner college        has been granted recognition by the NCTE

          and thereafter has also been granted affiliation by the

          University. However, on account of reasons unknown to the

          petitioner college, the University has suddenly written a letter to

          the respondent Nalanda Open University to withhold the

          admission process pertaining to the petitioner college, hence the

          petitioner college be permitted to make necessary admission

          during the pendency of the present writ petition subject to such

          conditions as may be imposed by this Court.

</p><p id="p_3">                      The learned counsel for the respondent University

          seeks sometime for filing the requisite counter affidavit.

</p><p id="p_4">                      Let the same be done within a period of four weeks

          from today.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                      Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the

          present case especially in view of the fact that the petitioner
          Patna High Court CWJC No.11684 of 2019(2) dt.18-06-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                     3/3</span>




                   college has already been granted recognition by the Eastern

                   Regional Committee, National Council for Teacher Education,

                   Bhubneshwar and thereafter it has been granted affiliation by

                   the respondent University, I deem it fit and proper to direct the

                   Nalanda Open University to permit the petitioner college to

                   take admission of the students for the current Session, however,

                   the petitioner college is directed to take undertaking from the

                   students that in case the present writ petition is dismissed, their

                   admission would be cancelled and they would not claim any

                   relief.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                               It goes without saying that the authorities of the

                   Nalanda Open University shall delete the words "affiliation

                   withdrawn" from the website today itself as far as the petitioner

                   college is concerned.

                   Admission'.
