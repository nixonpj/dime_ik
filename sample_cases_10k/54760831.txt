 WRIT PETITION Nos.2475, 2568, 2589, 2597, 2611, 2625,

     3116, 3122, 3125, 3135, 3138 and 3139 of 2019


COMMON ORDER :

      Since the issue raised in all these writ petitions is one and

the same, they are heard together and being disposed of by way

of a common order.


      The petitioners in all these writ petitions are challenging

the    Memorandum        No.CRP/PER/IR/C/081/1102,           dated

17.05.2013,      and     its     subsequent      Circular     vide

Ref.No.CRP/PER/IR/C/081/139, dated 21.01.2019, issued by

the respondents in restricting the Statutory benefits accrued in</pre>

<p id="p_1">favour of the petitioners under the <a href="/doc/1814464/" id="a_1">Mines Act</a>, 1952 and its

Rules 1955, as arbitrary and illegal, and consequently sought a

direction to declare that the petitioners are entitled for all the

Statutory benefits under the <a href="/doc/1814464/" id="a_2">Mines Act</a> and the Rules made

thereunder.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      The petitioners in all these writ petitions are employees of

the respondents - Singareni Collieries Company Limited.

Keeping in view their working conditions, certain benefits were

provided to the employees of the respondents - Company under

the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1814464/" id="a_3">Mines Act</a>, 1952 and the Rules made

thereunder by way of issuing various Circulars from time to
                                   2                           AKS, J

time. The grievance of the petitioners in these writ petitions is

that instead of following the Circular dated 09.03.2018 and its

subsequent    Circular    dated       21.01.2019   issued       by       the

respondents in respect of declaring the petitioners medically

unfit for discharging their duties and considering the cases of

the   dependants   of    the   petitioners   for   appointment            on

compassionate grounds, the respondents are insisting the

petitioners to give an undertaking to the effect that on their

medical invalidation, they will not claim any employment to

their dependants, which is contrary to the above said Circulars

dated 09.03.2018 and 21.01.2019 issued by the respondents.


</p><p id="p_4">      The learned Standing Counsel for the respondents -

Company submits that the cases of the petitioners will be

considered strictly in terms of the Circulars dated 09.03.2018

and 21.01.2019 issued by the respondents and no undertaking

would be insisted while considering the cases of the petitioners

for referring them to the Medical Board as to whether the

petitioners are medically fit or unfit for continuing in the

employment.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">      This Court, having considered the rival submissions of the

learned counsel for the respective parties, is of the considered

view that these writ petitions can be disposed of directing the

respondents to strictly follow the Circulars dated 09.03.2018

and 21.01.2019 issued by the respondents without insisting for

any undertaking from the petitioners while considering their
                                  3                         AKS, J

cases for referring them to the Medical Board with regard to

their medical fitness for continuing in the employment.


</p><p id="p_7">     With the above observations, these writ petitions are

disposed of. No order as to costs.

these writ petitions shall stand closed.
