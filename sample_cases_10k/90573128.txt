<p id="p_1">VIKRAMAJIT SEN, J.
</p>

<pre id="pre_2">1     Leave granted.
2     The Appellant, IRCON International, is impugning the Judgment  of  the
</pre><p id="p_2">Learned Division Bench of the Madras High Court,  which  had  dismissed  two
Original Second Appeals  preferred  by  the  Appellant.  Recapitulating  the
facts of this litigation, the  Appellant  was  the  successful  tenderer  in
respect of a contract awarded to it by S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>OT (not a party  to  the  present
dispute/  Appeal),  for  the  construction  of  an  Internal  Road  for  the
Industrial Complex at  Irungattukottal,  Sriperumbpudur  Taluk,  Kanchipuram
District, Tamil Nadu.  The  contract  between  these  parties  was  made  on
10.07.1997 and was valued  at  Rs.13,06,60,587/-.   In  furtherance  of  the
execution of this contract, the  Appellant  entered  into  two  subcontracts
(hereinafter, “the subcontracts”) with the Respondent herein, in respect  of
two Packages, namely “C1” and “C2”,  for  the  laying  of  roads  valued  at
Rs.3,20,64,752/- and Rs.1,67,01,821/- respectively. The cumulative value  of
both packages amounted to Rs.4,87,66,573 /-.
</p><p id="p_3">3     The Respondent completed approximately 67 per cent of the  work  under
the two subcontracts but thereafter ceased  work  on  both.   The  Appellant
cancelled the subcontracts, and  managed  the  completion  of  the  work  by
engaging other agencies. The cost of 67 per cent  of  the  contractual  work
completed by the Respondent was estimated at Rs.3.23 crores,  out  of  which
the Appellant admittedly paid  a  sum  of  Rs.2.62  crores.  The  Respondent
claimed an unpaid balance of Rs.61  lakhs  as  arrears  due  to  it  by  the
Appellant, and resorted to arbitration.  The Appellant  also  took  recourse
to arbitration against the main contracting authority,  S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>OT,  in  respect
of the pending payments pertaining to C1 and  C2  packages.  The  Arbitrator
was thus  adjudicating  the  claims  made  by  the  Respondent  against  the
Appellant in the First Arbitration, and the  claims  made  in  turn  by  the
Appellant against S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>OT in the Second Arbitration. The Arbitrator passed  a
common Award in the First Arbitration for both packages  in  favour  of  the
Respondent for the sum of Rs.7,87,21,820/- for C1 and  Rs.1,38,78,139/-  for
C2, both sums carrying with them interest at the rate  of  twelve  per  cent
from 04.03.2001 until the date of payment.  Interest  apart,  the  Appellant
stood liable as a result of the Award to pay the Respondent Rs.9,25,99,959/-
, including the aforementioned Rs.61 lakhs.
</p><p id="p_4">4     The Appellant filed two petitions (OP Nos. 107 and 108) under  <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_4">Section
34</a> of  the  Arbitration  and  <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_5">Conciliation  Act</a>,  1996,  thereby  separately
challenging the Award  passed  in  respect  of  the  two  subcontracts.  The
Respondent filed two applications in  the  two  petitions,  contending  that
while the Appellant had rejected the Respondent’s claims of payment  arrears
under the two subcontracts, it had, at the same  time  and  contradictorily,
claimed  in  the  Second  Arbitration  against  S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>OT  that  its  dues   to
Respondent were in turn payable to it by S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a>OT.  By  a  common  Order,  the
Single  Judge  dismissed  the  Appellant’s   petitions   and   allowed   the
Respondent’s applications.  The  Appellants  thereafter  filed  two  Appeals
before the Division Bench of  the  Madras  High  Court,  which  came  to  be
dismissed.  The  Appellant’s  conflicting  claims  and  statements  in  both
arbitrations, seen and  put  together,  have  proved  determinative  in  the
dismissal of the Appeals by the Courts below; they shall prove similarly  so
here.
</p><p id="p_5">5     Detailing the arrears claim, it is seen that the  Respondent  incurred
expenditure in the execution  of  the  subcontracts  on  two  categories  of
items: scheduled and non-scheduled. The Respondent claimed  Rs.61  lakhs  as
its due under both these heads.    The  Appellant’s  principle  rebuttal  in
resistance to the Respondent’s claim is that the main contract (between  the
Appellant and S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a>OT) and the subcontracts are wholly  of  a  “back-to-back”
nature and therefore the liability of the Appellant would be  restricted  to
and coextensive of that which S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">IPC</a>OT acknowledges.    In  other  words,  the
acceptability and tenability of any claim made  by  the  Respondent  against
the  Appellant  will  depend  first  upon  that  claim’s  acceptability  and
tenability before S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a>OT in  its  capacity  as  the  employer  in  the  main
contract. The  Appellant  declined  to  pay  the  Respondent  for  scheduled
expenditures, claiming that  the  Respondent  had  unauthorisedly  performed
additional and increased quantities of  works,  also  challenging  the  rate
claimed by the Respondent for the same; that the Respondent could not  claim
any amount in excess of what was agreed to be paid by S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11">IPC</a>OT in  respect  of
each item of work covered under C1 and C2 subcontracts. The  Appellant  also
rejected the Respondent’s claimed dues under the non-scheduled  head  (which
work the Appellant itself had requested to be performed by the  Respondent),
stating  that  S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_12">IPC</a>OT  had  refuted  its  liability  towards   non-scheduled
expenditures.   Indeed, the Arbitrator in his Award  detected  two  “general
pleas” as resonating from the Appellant:   firstly, that  the  contracts  C1
and C2 were on a “back to  back”  basis  with  IRCON’s  main  contract  with
S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_13">IPC</a>OT and unless S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14">IPC</a>OT paid for the amounts  claimed  by  the  Respondent,
the Appellant was not legally liable for the same; and secondly,  that  back
to back basis applied even to non-scheduled items.
</p><p id="p_6">6     The Arbitrator found that the mention of “back-to-back” had been  made
only in the contract rider agreement  for  Package  C2,  and  in  subsequent
epistles exchanged between IRCON and the Respondent from whose analysis  two
significant factors emerge.   Firstly, that “back-to-back” only  meant  that
the terms and conditions relating to technical specifications, and  quality,
quantum, manner and method of work to be done by the Appellant in  the  main
contract, stood transposed on the  subcontracts,  C1  and  C2;  the  primary
liability of the Appellant to  the  Respondent,  however,  stood  untouched,
there having been no transference or transposition of  this  liability  onto
S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_15">IPC</a>OT, either explicitly or implicitly.  Secondly,  the  Appellant  had  in
its Written Statement before the Arbitrator, reiterated  the  “back-to-back”
nature and thereby agreed that the Respondent would be entitled  to  payment
of dues as and when the  Appellant  received  the  payment  for  these  from
S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_16">IPC</a>OT, the Respondent’s claims having been “transmitted” by  the  Appellant
to S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_17">IPC</a>OT for the latter’s  consideration.   The  Appellant  has  taken  the
stance that it had no objection to  the  Arbitrator  awarding  a  reasonable
amount to the Respondent, subject to the Appellant being  awarded  the  same
amount by the Arbitrator in its Arbitration with S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_18">IPC</a>OT. The  Appellant  was
agreeable to a direction passed against it to make payment upon  realization
of the sum from S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_19">IPC</a>OT, after a 10 per cent deduction  on  the  sum  as  the
Appellant’s marginal profit. The Arbitrator, unstirred  by  the  Appellant’s
gambit at foisting  the  primary  liability  onto  S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_20">IPC</a>OT,  located  primary
liability as resting  with  the  Appellant,  being  the  ‘employer’  in  the
subcontracts. The Arbitrator also instanced the Appellant’s reprobative  and
approbative conduct, observing first the Appellants conditional  willingness
(supra) for the passage of a favourable Award in  the  Respondent’s  favour,
and thereafter finding a retraction of the Appellant’s position:  viz.  that
</p><p id="p_7">- “Since S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_21">IPC</a>OT refused to pay for these claims, IRCON has taken  up  a  new
stand that works were not done fully and payment has been made for  whatever
work was done  by  the  claimant”.    Having  so  observed,  the  Arbitrator
awarded as aforementioned.
</p><p id="p_8">7     The Single Judge rightly upheld the Arbitrator’s  repudiation  of  the
applicability of the “back-to-back” principle to the issue of  liability  of
payment in the facts of this case; affirming that the Appellant as  Employer
was primarily liable to  the  Respondent.  Beyond  this,  the  Single  Judge
adverted to the Award obtained by  the  Appellant  against  S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_22">IPC</a>OT,  wherein
claims had been raised against S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_23">IPC</a>OT on the  basis  of  the  earlier  Award
obtained against the Appellant.  The Single Judge accepted the  Respondent’s
contention that “the very same claim, which the respondent made against  the
petitioner has been made by the petitioner against the S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_24">IPC</a>OT  and  on  that
basis, an award has been  passed  in  favour  of  the  petitioner”.   It  is
facially apparent that, on the  one  hand,  the  Appellant  had  obtained  a
favourable Award in the Arbitration with S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_25">IPC</a>OT by substantially relying  on
(and as compensation for) the adverse Award passed in its  arbitration  with
the Respondent; on the other hand,  it  appealed  before  the  Single  Judge
against the adverse Award which  had  substantially  been  the  premiss  and
reason for the  Appellant’s  success  against  S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_26">IPC</a>OT.    In  addition,  the
Appellant expostulated that the Applications before the Single  Judge  ought
to have been heard along with the Applications filed by S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_27">IPC</a>OT  for  setting
aside of the Award in Appellant’s favour in the Second Arbitration.  To  not
have done so would be to disjoin the Awards, leaving it open  for  the  High
Court to come  to  two  dissonant  conclusions  in  the  two  interdependent
arbitrations;  the  Appellant’s  expressed  fear  being   that   while   its
obligation to pay, as sealed by the Award in favour  of  the  respondent  in
the First Arbitration, would be sustained, the award in its  favour  against
S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_28">IPC</a>OT, if heard  separately,  would  possibly  be  set  aside,  leaving  it
uncompensated and liable to pay the  Respondent  the  claimed  amount.   The
Single Judge observed that no material had been brought  on  record,  nor  a
specific plea raised or details adduced, that S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_29">IPC</a>OT had filed a <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_30">Section  34</a>
petition before the same Court in a  challenge  against  the  Award  in  the
Respondent’s favour; a mere statement  from  the  Appellant’s  counsel  made
across the bar was not sufficient  materially  to  justify  the  demand  for
connecting and hearing the petitions together.
</p><p id="p_9">8     The Learned Division  Bench  wholly  ratified  the  reasoning  of  the
Arbitrator and Single Judge below it, finding no reason to  disencumber  the
Appellant from the obligation to  fulfill  the  Respondent’s  claim.   While
entirely agreeing with the  reasons  given  against  the  Appellant  by  the
Arbitrator and the  Courts  below,  we  also  find  additional  reasons  for
dismissing this set of Appeals.
</p><p id="p_10">9     While the Award in  the  S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_31">IPC</a>OT  arbitration  is  not  immediately  an
appellate subject herein, yet it is still part of the record  and  therefore
merits our consideration. Until an order to the contrary be  adduced  before
this Court, this Award must  be  assumed  to  be  standing  and  valid.  Its
validity and legitimacy in law, insofar as it has depended  on  the  earlier
Award qua the adjudication of claims,  would  only  be  justifiable  by  the
validity of the earlier Award in the Respondent’s favour. The earlier  Award
must, therefore, be presupposed to be valid, when the validity of the  later
Award has not been disproved or rebutted.  Seen  from  this  dimension,  the
Award in favour of the Appellant is positively valid, and  its  unsettlement
an uninviting prospect.
</p><p id="p_11">10    Insofar as the question of primary  liability  therein  is  concerned,
the law on subcontracts and employer  liability  is  amply  clear.   In  the
absence of covenant in the main contract  to  the  contrary,  the  rules  in
relation to privity of  contract  will  mean  that  the  jural  relationship
between the employer and the main contractor on the  one  hand  and  between
the sub-contractor and the main  contractor  on  the  other  will  be  quite
distinct and separate.   No such clause to the  contrary,  existent  in  the
main contract between Appellants and S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_32">IPC</a>OT, has been highlighted before  us
by the Appellants, which would persuade us  towards  a  deviation  from  the
presumption of distinct and sole liability of  the  Appellant-Contractor  as
employer viz. a. viz. the Respondent-Sub  Contractor.     On  the  contrary,
much of the exercise in  determining  the  existence  of  a  “back  to  back
clause” in the contracts C1 and C2  appears  to  be  misplaced.     Such  an
accommodation or transference of liability needs to  be  pinpointed  in  the
main contract, for it is S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_33">IPC</a>OT’s acceptance of liability  of  subcontractor
claims which is of the essence; even a  clause  indicating  “back  to  back”
liability in agreements C1 and  C2  would  not  serve  to  novate  the  main
contract and fasten payment liability on S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_34">IPC</a>OT, prevented as  it  would  be
by  privity,  for  it  would  be  a  matter  of   S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_35">IPC</a>OT’s   acceptance   of
subcontractor liability in the main contract, and not a matter  of  novation
by imposition upon S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_36">IPC</a>OT by two parties in a separate  bilateral  contract.
Nothing presented  before  us  suggests  that  S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_37">IPC</a>OT’s  contract  with  the
Appellant provided for “back to back” subcontracts whereby S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_38">IPC</a>OT  would  be
directly answerable for the  payment  claims  raised  by  contractors.  That
subletting was provided for by the main contract, and indeed  occurred,  has
been found by the Arbitrator (in both  Arbitrations)  and  affirmed  by  the
Courts below. This however, is quite distinct from  concluding  that  S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_39">IPC</a>OT
contractually (in the main agreement)  assumed  primary  liability  for  the
Subcontractor-Respondent’s payment claims  in  respect  of  agreements  made
with the Appellant.  The  fact  that  the  Respondent  was  represented  and
present in parleys and meetings between S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_40">IPC</a>OT and the Appellant or that  it
was referred to in the correspondence exchanged between them does  not  lead
to the conclusion that  a  Tripartite  contract  had  come  into  effect  by
evolution.
</p><p id="p_12">11     The  Appellant  conceded  before  the  Arbitrator   that   it   would
countenance an Award  in  favour  of  the  Respondent  as  long  as  it  was
indemnified for the payment made to the Respondent by  an  equal  offsetting
payment by way of an Award in its favour in  its  arbitration  with  S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_41">IPC</a>OT.
The record, as has been hereinbefore referenced, shows  that  the  Appellant
was granted precisely such an Award. The legal import of the nature  of  the
Appellant’s admission of liability made before the Arbitrator in  the  First
Arbitration now needs deliberation. The Appellant  exercised  care  to  make
this concession by conjoining therewith its demand  for  adjustment  in  the
Second Arbitration.  To  that  extent  the  concession  could  be  called  a
conditional one. At the heart  of  the  concession  however,  the  admission
itself, taken alone, was not conditional. The Appellant thereby admitted  an
unconditional contractual liability on its  part  to  pay  the  Respondent’s
contractual  claim,  albeit   dressing   the   same   in   the   shroud   of
conditionality, by the expedient of making the concession dependent  upon  a
consequent favourable outcome in  the  Second  Arbitration.  This  was  then
followed by a remarkable transition in the Appellant’s legal  posture,  from
one  of  conditional  agreeability,  to  outright  denial  of  any  and  all
liability on its part to pay the Respondent, stating that S<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_42">IPC</a>OT was  wholly
answerable for the satisfaction  of  all  contractual  claims  and  payments
demanded by the Respondent, due to the “back to back”  nature  of  the  main
contract with agreements C1 and C2. The Appellant,  we  find,  stands  bound
and bonded by the legal consequences of this initial admission  made  by  it
before the Arbitrator. Having concluded thus, we yet underscore  to  observe
that the Division Bench below proceeded on the  merits  in  this  matter  in
upholding the Award, and did not simply hold the Appellant  to  account  for
the consequences of its admission.
</p><p id="p_13">12    We also find  that  the  Appellant’s  case  is  not  advanced  by  its
reliance upon the  three  Judge  Bench  decision  in  Oil  and  Natural  Gas
Corporation Ltd. Vs. Western Geco International Ltd. (2014) 9 SCC 263.    We
cannot subscribe to the argument on behalf of  the  Appellant  that  it  was
merely a Consultant and therefore could not be fastened  with  liability  or
was imperious to claims preferred by the Respondent for  work  contractually
carried out, or, in respect of claims founded  on  the  bedrock  of  quantum
meruit.
</p><p id="p_14">13    For the foregoing reasons, we decline to interfere with  the  judgment
properly exercised by the Arbitrator  and  Courts  below,  and  sustain  the
impugned order in its entirety.
</p><p id="p_15">14    Interim orders stand recalled. Appeals dismissed. Parties are to  bear
their respective costs.
