ORDER 
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.           The   law   point   which   has   been   raised   by   the   appellant   in  this

   appeal is "Whether the appellant as well as other legal heirs of the three

   partners who all have died of M/s Har Gopal and Madan Gopal should

   have been  issued  the show cause  notice by the executing court  of the

   execution   application   since   the   legal   heirs   were   impleaded   in   the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                              1</span>
 execution for the first time and they were entitled to protect the estate of

the deceased partners."     More so, that they were entitled to protect the

estate   of   late   partners   of   the   firm   M/s   Har   Gopal   and   Madan   Gopal

against whom an eviction decree was passed by Ld. ARC.   It is submitted

that after the death of the partners, the partnership comes to an end and

the tenancy is inherited by the legal heirs of the deceased partners   on

account of the provisions contained u/s 2 (l) of DRC Act.  It is, therefore,

submitted that even though the appeal filed by the JD stood abated as

legal heirs of the deceased partners stood abated,  the appellant and other

legal heirs of deceased partners should have been brought on record for

purposes of execution should have been issued a show cause notice by the

executing   court.     The   appellant   has   agreed   from   the   dismissal   of   his

application moved before executing court for similar relief.  According to

the respondents who accepted the notice in the court, no such procedure

was required to be followed by the executing court, in as much as, the

application   for   execution   was   filed   within   two   yeas   of   passing   of   te


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          2</span>
    eviction   order.     It   is   submitted   that   legal   heirs   were   only   impleaded

   because possession was taken to be taken from them.  It is also submitted

   that   since   the   appeal   file   by   late   partners   stood   abated,   the   order   of

   eviction which was passed on the ground subletting non­payment of rent

   etc. became final.  They have prayed for dismissal of the appeal.

</p><p id="p_2">2.           Appellant   has   referred   to   provision   of   Order   21   rule   22   CPC

<p id="p_3">3.          The perusal of the aforesaid provision goes to show that notice

   requires to be given only if the execution is filed after the period of two

   years.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.          I have heard learned counsel for the parties and also perused the

   trial court record.  
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.          In this case, the order of eviction was passed against the firm M/s

   Madan Gopal Har Gopal which was regd. partnership firm on 30.8.2002,

   the appeal filed by them stood abated vide order passed by appellant court



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                            4</span>
    on   7.1.2003.     The   present   execution   was   filed   on   12.11.2003   and

   therefore was within two years of the passing of the eviction order.

</p><p id="p_6">6.           The appellant filed an application objecting to the execution by

   pleading that he was one of the legal heir of one of the deceased partner

   of JD.   He also pleaded that no notice of the execution application was

   given to him.  He appeared on his own.  It was stated in the application

   that as per requirement u/o 21 rule 22 CPC, the notice of the execution

   should have been issued to the LRs of the deceased JD and no warrants

   can   be  issued   against   them  by the  executing  court.   Hence,  the entire

   proceedings in the present execution petition are invalid on account of

   non­issuance of notice to the LRs impleaded in the execution petition for

   the first time. The application was strongly opposed on behalf of DH.

   Some   of   the   observation   made   by   the   trial   court   in   this   regard   is

   reproduced   in   para   3   of   the   order   which   for   the   sake   of   reference   is

   reproduced here:
</p>
<p id="p_7">                   "The application has been strongly opposed on


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                               5</span>
 behalf of DH.   Ld. Counsel for DH has drawn
my   attention   to   the   fact   that   on   an   earlier
occasion   Sh.   Devinder   Berry   had   filed   an
application   on   1.11.2004   contending   that   the
execution   proceedings   do   not   lie   and   are   not
maintainable against the JD who is dead and as
such, proceedings are null and void.   The said
application   was  dismissed  by Sh.  Atul  Kumar
Garg,   the   then   ARC,   Delhi   and   the   appeal
against   the   said   order   was   accepted   by   Ld.
</p><p id="p_8">ARCT, Delhi by judgment dt. 28.3.2005 where
it   had   been   observed   that   before   warrants   of
possession are executed, executing court should
call upon the DH to disclose the names of the
LRs.   Madan   Gopal   Berry   and   that   notice   be
issued to the said LRs. Hon'ble High Court, vide
its   judgment   dt.   30.3.2005   filed   against   the
aforesaid order of Ld. ARCT set aside the said
order and observed that the executing court is
bound by the decree and the court can insist on
parties  to  be  added or served other  than legal
representatives of Har Gopal.  Since, it has been
found   by   the   appellate   court   that   LRs   of   Har
Gopal Berry were not brought on record and the
appeal stood abated, which order was also up­
held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.  It has been
submitted by Ld. Counsel for DH that by way of
the present application, application seek to re­
agitate the same issues which have already been
adjudicated upon vide order dt. 30.3.2006.  It is
also   submitted   that   admittedly   as   per   record


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                           6</span>
                   applicant   had   earlier   also   filed   objections   and
                  contested the matter, it therefore, can not be said
                  that   the   applicants   were   not   having   any
                  knowledge   of   the   institution   of   the   present
                  execution proceedings."
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.           The perusal of the aforesaid shows that the appellant somehow

   wanted   to   stop   the   execution   of   the   decree.     Firstly,   he   sought   the

   objection by filing an application u/s 47 CPC by pleading that since all

   the three partners of the partnership firm M/s Madan Gopal Har Gopal

   why   decree   could   not   have   been   executed   against   them   after   the   said

   application was dismissed by the court of Ld. ARC.   The order of the

   appellant court allowing the application was set aside by Hon'ble High

   Court of Delhi.

                  order under challenge as also the order of the
                 court.     It   appears   that   the   matter   proceeded
                 before   the   trial   court   on   the   basis   that   M/s
                 Madan  Gopal  Har Gopal  was  a proprietorship
                 concern since the contesting party appeared as a
                 proprietor and no one challenged this position.
                 It was on the basis that the matter was taken up
                 in appeal.  In the appeal the legal representatives
                 had not been brought on record on the death of
                 Har Gopal.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                            The   appellate   Court   found   that   legal
                 representatives   of   Har   Gopal   having   not   been
                 brought on record the appeal abated, which also
                 found   favour   with   the   Supreme   Court.     The
                 Executing   court,   therefore,   is   bound   by   the
                 decree.  The court can not insist on the parties to
                 be   added   or   served   other   than   legal
                 representatives of Har Gopal.   In this view of
                 the matter, the direction of the Additional Rent
                 Control   Tribunal   are   set   aside.     Civil
                 Miscellaneous   Main   875/2005   is   allowed   and
                 disposed   of.     This,   however,   is   without
                 prejudice to any other person who may be able
                 to show any interest, right or title in M/s Madan
                 Gopal Har Gopal at which the court will then
                 proceed in accordance with law.  
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">8.          It is submitted by Ld. Counsel for the appellant that it was in

   pursuance   with   the   said   order   they   moved   application   in   question.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                            8</span>
    However, trial court has not considered the application and dismissed the

   same.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.           In the course of arguments addressed by the ld. Counsel for the

   appellant   that   since   the   applicant   is   one   he   legal   heir   of   one   of   the

   deceased partner of M/s Madan Gopal Har Gopal, he by virtue of section

   2 (e) of the DRC Act succeeds to the tenancy in his own right.  Once his

   father expired, no explanation is being furnished by the appellant as to

   why he did not thought it proper to become a party in the appellant court.

   Once   the   partner   expire   and   the   appellant   court   had   to   abate   the

   proceedings   which   stands   abated.     Moreover,   application   which   was

   moved by the appellant, he took a different plea that M/s Madan Gopal

   Har   Gopal   was   the   proprietorship   concern   which   was   never   taken

   throughout the proceedings.   Such objections can not be allowed to be

   taken for the first time during the curse of execution because execution or

   in appeal against the order of eviction because such plea could have been

   taken only by the deceased partners from the partners in their own right in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                9</span>
 the suit.  No such plea was taken.  In any event, once appeal could have

been objected, trial court judgment become final and executive.  Now the

appellant can not interfere with the execution of the decree and moved

another application on the pretext of order 21 rule 22 CPC by stating that

show cause notice should have been issued to them.   The appellant has

relied upon  the Judgment delivered by Andhra Pradesh High Court  as

reported in AIR 2005 AP 506.   This judgment is not applicable to the

facts 




of this case because the execution application was filed within 2 years of

the passing of the order.   The filing of the application by the appellant

was   only   but   to   misuse   of   process   of   court.     They   wanted   to   stop

execution of decree somehow or the other which they admit they have

been making number of times.  It may be observed here that suit filed by

the   respondent   against   the   original   tenant   was   on   the   ground   of   sub­

letting.  As stated above, the appeal stands abated against the said order.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                          10</span>
   The said order has been upheld by Supreme Court of India.  However, it

  may be observed that the appellant are not new persons.  They claims to

  be legal heirs of the deceased partners of M/s   Madan Gopal and Har

  Gopal, the partnership firm against whom eviction decree has been passed

  and which has become  final.  They being the legal heirs of partners are

  bound by decree and can not claim otherwise.   It is not the case where

  they have any independent right as prescribed u/s 25 of DRC Act which

  may   unable   them   to   challenge   the   entire   proceedings   right   from   the

  beginning.

</p><p id="p_13">10.        Thus,   I  find   that   order   passed   by   trial   court   is   fully   justified.

  Hence the appeal is dismissed with cost of Rs.25000/­.  Copy of this order
