                              JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">A.M.Shaffique, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     This original petition has been filed challenging the order

dated 22.12.2016 in I.A.No.2136/16 in O.P.No.564/16.                          The

original petition was filed by the petitioner herein seeking

custody of the minor children invoking <a href="/doc/1192053/" id="a_1">Section 9</a> of the

Guardians      and       <a href="/doc/1608688/" id="a_2">Wards         Act</a>,      1890.        Respondent      filed

I.A.No.2136/16 seeking for raising a preliminary issue relating

to territorial jurisdiction of the court.                      The court having

considered the matter, observed that the court at Ettumanoor,

Kottayam has no jurisdiction to entertain the petition.                       It is

impugning the aforesaid order that this original petition is filed.

</p><p id="p_3">     2.   Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the

court below has not considered the matter in its proper

perspective.     It is contended that the question of territorial

jurisdiction is a question of fact and law which has to be

decided on the basis of pleadings and evidence in the case and
O.P.(F.C.)No.152 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                -:2:-</span>

therefore, the court ought to have considered the issue, only

after completion of pleadings and recording of evidence.

Learned counsel also placed reliance upon the judgment of

this Court reported in Salini v. Umasankaran (2016(4) KLT

1068) to narrate the manner in which the words 'ordinarily

resides' had been considered by this Court.

</p><p id="p_4">       3. The short question to be considered in this original

petition is whether the Family Court was justified in deciding

the maintainability of the issue as a preliminary issue and

secondly, whether the findings of the Family Court were

justifiable.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       4. Perusal of the averments in the petition would show

that neither the petitioner nor the respondent was ordinarily

residing within the jurisdiction of the court at Kottayam. In

paragraph 9 of the original petition itself it is stated that the

couple along with the family were residing at Bombay and

thereafter in Dubai.       In paragraph 9 it is stated that on

4.4.2016, the petitioner had come back to his native place.

The respondent was employed in Dubai and as the said

company had an associate company at Hyderabad, her plan

was to join that company and work there. The respondent had

gone to Bombay on 17.4.2016 and joined the Hyderabad
O.P.(F.C.)No.152 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        -:3:-</span>

company on 18.4.2016.             At the relevant time, the children

were     with     the      petitioner     at    their   parental   house   at

Changanassery. On 26.4.2016, when the petitioner called the

respondent, she was not available. It is further alleged that on

30.4.2016, the respondent had come to Changanassery and

without the consent of the parents of the petitioner and the

petitioner, the children were taken to Hyderabad, offering to

bring them back within one week. This being the allegations,

the question to be considered is based on <a href="/doc/1249334/" id="a_3">Section 9(1)</a> of the

Guardians and <a href="/doc/1608688/" id="a_4">Wards Act</a>, 1890, which reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "Court having jurisdiction to entertain application.--
              (1) If the application is with respect to the guardianship
              of the person of the minor, it shall be made to the
              District Court having jurisdiction in the place where the
              minor ordinarily resides."</blockquote><p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">       5. The question to be considered is whether the minors

were ordinarily residing within the jurisdiction of the Family

Court at Ettumanoor. The only incident of residence of stay is

after leaving the employment by the couple, they have come

from Dubai and stayed at the petitioner's family house for a

brief period. Even the petitioner's wife had taken custody of

the children prior to the institution of the proceedings and the

minors are now with the mother at Hyderabad. Children are

also studying at Hyderabad. Merely for the reason that the
O.P.(F.C.)No.152 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    -:4:-</span>

minors had resided at their parental home for a brief period,

does not mean that they were ordinarily residing at that place

and the court at Ettumanoor will have the jurisdiction to

entertain the original petition. Primarily they were residing at

Bombay, thereafter at Dubai and presently at Hyderabad

where the children are studying.            It is taking note of these

factors, the Family Court had observed that the said court has

no jurisdiction. We do not find any infirmity in the said order.

</p><p id="p_8">       6. Coming to the question in regard to the meaning of

the words 'ordinarily resides', it depends upon the facts and

circumstances of each case. Even the Division Bench of this

Court held in              Salini v. Umasankaran (cited supra) at

paragraphs 18 and 19 as under:
