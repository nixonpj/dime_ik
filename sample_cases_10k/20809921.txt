<p id="p_1"> CM No. 2859-CII of 2010

            There is delay of 160 days in filing the appeal. This

 is an appeal by the claimants who were not awarded any

 compensation and rather their claim petition was dismissed.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                         -2-</span>


           Though reply has been filed to the said application,

yet nothing material has come in the reply. So for the reasons

given in the application, the delay of 160 days in filing the

appeal is condoned.
</p>
<p id="p_3">FAO No. 6554 of 2010

           This is an appeal brought by the claimants against

dismissal of their claim petition vide award dated 09.12.2009.

Learned Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Hisar (for short 'the

Tribunal) has returned finding on issue no.1 against the

appellants holding that the accident is not proved to have been

caused by rash and negligent driving of vehicle No. HR-20M-

8256 by Rajender Singh, respondent no.1.
</p>
<p id="p_4">           The appellants-claimants claimed that during the

night of 04.05.2007 Rajbir, the deceased was going on

motorcycle bearing registration No. HR-23-B-7803 from

Uklana to village Bhimawala. He was driving the motorcycle at

a moderate speed and was in control of the vehicle. When he

was near the fields of Master Hoshiar Singh situated in between

village Bhithmara and Bhimawala, a maruti car bearing

registration No. HR-20M-8256 driven by Rajender Singh,

respondent no.1 came in a rash and negligent manner from the

opposite side and struck against the motorcycle, on account of
                F.A. O. No.6554 of 2010 (O&amp;M)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                          -3-</span>


which the motorcycle fell in the road side ditches. Rajbir is said

to have suffered serious injuries in the said accident. He

succumbed to those injuries at the spot. Respondent no.1 after

causing the accident fled from the spot. Hanuman son of Ram

Karan, resident of village Chamar Khera            had seen the

occurrence, who reported the matter to the police on

18.06.2007.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            The claim of the claimants in this regard was denied

by the respondents. Respondents No.1 and 2 claimed that the

maruti car in question was being driven at a normal speed and

that the accident was due to rash and negligent driving of the

motorcycle in question.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that

Hanuman saw the accident. According to him, for the only

reason that he had to go for his own work and could not inform

the police or the relatives of the deceased about the number of

the vehicle, he cannot be disbelieved.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            On the other hand, learned counsel for the

respondents have submitted that Hanuman is a procured

witness, who made statement at the instance of the appellants to

suit them in this case.
</p><p id="p_8">                F.A. O. No.6554 of 2010 (O&amp;M)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                           -4-</span>


             It is not a case where any other person had seen the

accident. Hanuman did not inform the police or the relatives of

the deceased in this regard for 14 days after the accident. The

accident occurred at about 10 or 11 PM in the night and it is

admitted case that the driver of the offending vehicle did not

stop at the spot. When the lights of the car were switched on at

the time of the accident, it was not possible for anyone to have

seen the driver of the offending vehicle or even seen the

registration number of the car. The witness had also wrongly

stated the colour of the car as blue while it was silver colour car.

There was no occasion for Hanuman to have come before the

police all of a sudden after 14 days of the accident.

</p><p id="p_9">             All these circumstances have been taken by the

Tribunal to conclude that Hanuman is a procured witness as

well as the vehicle and the driver are also convenient, against

whom the case could be got prepared. Learned Tribunal has,

thus, not been wrong in returning finding on issue no.1 against

the claimants. The said finding is consequently affirmed. The

appeal, therefore, appears to have no merit and is dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
