DIPAK MISRA, CJ


</pre><p id="p_1">       The present intra-Court appeal is directed against the order dated 7th

April, 2010 passed by the learned Single Judge in WP (C) No. 5702/1999.




</p><p id="p_2">LPA No. 431/2010                                                        page 1 of 42
</p><p id="p_3"> 2.     The facts leading to the filing of the writ petition are that the

appellant-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as „the appellant‟) took "Jeevan

Kishor Policy" for his daughter, Aprajita, for a sum of Rs.1 lakh by Policy

No. 120312578 dated 14th October, 1994. The yearly premium of Rs.5,533/-

was payable for the policy.     The appellant paid the premium for two

consequent years, that is, 1994-95 and 1995-96.         The daughter of the

appellant expired on 11th September, 1996 in unfortunate circumstances

and thereafter no further premium was paid.          After the death of the

daughter, the appellant sent a letter on 20th December, 1996 to the Life

Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) informing them about the death of

his daughter and asking for the claim under the policy to be settled. When

no response was received, he was compelled to knock at the doors of this

Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.


</p><p id="p_4">3.     It was contended in the writ petition that no payment was made in

view of the stipulation in the policy to the effect that the policy shall stand

cancelled in case the life assured dies before the deferred date. Be it noted,

the said clause of the policy was assailed on the foundation that LIC is

obliged to make the payment and cannot take shelter under the said policy

on the ground that it is not obliged to make any payment if the assured


LPA No. 431/2010                                                 page 2 of 42
 dies prior to the deferred date.     It was urged that such a clause was

arbitrary, unilateral and unfair.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">4.     The LIC combated the averments made in writ petition on the

ground that the petitioner could have filed a civil suit as he was seeking

enforcement of a contractual obligation; that the claim put forth by the

petitioner has been repudiated in terms of the conditions of the insurance

policy, which is basically a contract; that the stipulation in the policy is

neither arbitrary nor unreasonable; and that the deferred payment clause

is unassailable as the parties to the policy are bound by the terms of the

policy.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">5.     A rejoinder affidavit was filed stating, inter alia, that as long as the

premium was paid, it is not open to the LIC to repudiate the claim and

deny payment. That apart, the deferred date in the instant case was 14th

October, 1996 and the assured died on 11th September, 1996. It is also put

forth that the classification of life insurance policies into those payable

only after the deferred date and those without such limitation was

arbitrary and discriminatory.
</p>
<p id="p_9">


</p><p id="p_10">LPA No. 431/2010                                                 page 3 of 42
</p><p id="p_11"> 6.     An additional affidavit was filed by the LIC contending, inter alia,

that "Jeevan Kishor Policy" was made only for the middle income/higher

income class. It was a flexible policy where the minimum and maximum

amount that could be insured was Rs.20,000/- and Rs.5 lakhs respectively.

The premium is a multiple of the tabular rate paid depending upon the

desired sum assured and the age of the assured. It was also explained that

in the case of children, it is not practically possible to obtain any medical

report for a child which would indicate the future expected mortality in

respect of life and any medical examination is unlikely to reveal an

authentic and reliable insight into the health status of a child. LIC, in order

to safeguard its own interest, has imposed restrictions under the Jeevan

Kishor plan before the risk on the children commences and that is why, the

imposition of the „deferred date‟ or „waiting period‟.


</p><p id="p_12">7.     The learned Single Judge expressed the view that the stand of the

LIC that the petitioner should have filed a suit was untenable in view of

the decision in <a href="/doc/1943124/" id="a_2">ABL International Ltd. v. Export Credit Guarantee

Corporation of India Ltd</a>., (2004) 3 SCC 553. Being of this opinion, the

learned Single Judge proceeded to state as follows: -




</p><p id="p_13">LPA No. 431/2010                                                 page 4 of 42
               "8.     The stand of the LIC as extracted in the above
              paragraphs does not sufficiently explain the need for
              deferring the payment under policy for children for two years.
              It appears to this Court that once the LIC accepts the contract
              by offering to insure even the life of a child, then it obviously
              does do so irrespective of the age of the child. While
              insurance business is largely dependent on the analysis of
              risk, it is not possible to accept the submission of the LIC that
              the "deferred date" clause became necessary only on the basis
              of the risk that may be faced by the LIC. If the LIC chooses to
              insure children and collects premia, there is no justification for
              negativing a claim on the basis that payments thereunder
              should stand postponed to a "deferred date". There is no
              justification for imposition of a deferred date on the
              apprehension that such waiting period is necessary to prevent
              "moral hazards" involving the life of children.
</p>
<p id="p_14">              9.    xxx    xxx   xxx

</p><p id="p_15">              10.    In a further additional affidavit filed by the LIC on 28th
              April 2003, the information relating to number of Jeevan
              Kishor Policies issued from 1990-1991 to 2001-2002 including
              the ages of the victims have been given. Given the large
              number of Jeevan Kishor Policies issued [which stood at
              471000 as of 2001-02], the actual claims in respect of children
              in the age group of eleven years for the years 1999-2000, 2000-
              2001 and 2001-2002 are 39, 55 and 53 respectively. The figures
              are comparable for other age groups upto 15 years. By no
              means can it be argued that there will be far too many claims
              against the LIC if the "deferred date" clause is not
              incorporated. Given the number of claims being made on a
              yearly basis on account of the deaths of children under the
              Jeevan Kishor Policy, this Court holds that the LIC is not
              acting fairly or reasonably in insisting that no claim will be
              entertained for two years after the commencement of the
              policy."
</p>
<p id="p_16">


</p><p id="p_17">LPA No. 431/2010                                                  page 5 of 42
</p><p id="p_18"> 8.     After so holding, the learned Single Judge directed that the claims

made hereafter under the "Jeevan Kishor Policy" would not be repudiated

by the LIC on the ground that they have been made before the deferred

date, subject, of course, to other conditions being satisfied. It is worth

noting, such a direction was issued as the counsel for the appellant had

made a statement that he was not interested in obtaining any amount from

LIC but getting the legal position clarified.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">9.     We have heard Mr.Sandeep Sethi and Mr.B.B. Sawhney, learned

senior counsel along with Ms.Indira Sawhney, Mr.Lakshay Sawhney and

Mr.Sunil Kumar, learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr.Rakesh Tiku,

learned senior counsel along with Mr.Vivek Ojha, learned counsel for the

respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">10.    It is not in dispute that the deferred date, as per the policy, was 14th

October, 1996 but the daughter of the respondent died before the deferred

date. The Special Provision No.2 of the policy bond reads as follows: -


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "The policy shall stand cancelled in case the life assured shall
              die before the Deferred Date and in such event provided the
              policy is then in full force, a sum of money equal to all the
              premiums paid without any deduction whatsoever shall
              become payable to the person entitled to the policy moneys."
</blockquote>


<blockquote id="blockquote_2">LPA No. 431/2010                                                 page 6 of 42
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3"> 11.    The question that emerges for consideration is whether the

conclusions arrived at by the learned Single Judge to the effect that the

condition is unfair and unreasonable on the foundation that insurance

business is largely dependent on the analysis of the risk; that once the LIC

accepts the contract by offering to the insurer, even that of a child, it does

so irrespective of the age of the child; and that if LIC chooses to insure the

child and collect the premium, there is no justification to negative the

claim on the basis that the payments thereunder should stand postponed

to a deferred date. In quintessence, the issue is whether the condition

incorporated by way of a special provision in the policy invites the frown

of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_23">12.    The learned counsel for the appellants would contend that insurance

is basically a contract and the parties are governed by the stipulations in

the contract and when they have signed the contract of insurance knowing

the postulates engrafted therein, they cannot raise the plea of unfairness.

That apart, if the anatomy of the policy is scrutinized in proper

perspective, it is not remotely suggestive of any kind of unfairness and

does not smack of arbitrariness inasmuch as there is a proper classification

with regard to the payment of the sum assured in case of other categories


LPA No. 431/2010                                                 page 7 of 42
 of policy holder and the beneficiaries under "Jeevan Kishor Policy". The

learned counsel have commended us to certain literatures, citations and

circumstances which we shall dwell upon at a later stage of the order.


</p><p id="p_24">13.    Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondents would support

the order passed by the learned Single Judge contending, inter alia, that

the life insurance policy stands in contradistinction to other categories of

policy and once the premium is paid, it is obligatory and incumbent on the

part of the Corporation to make good the assured sum and it cannot

impede the payability on the ground that there is a stipulation of deferred

date. It is propounded by them that the prescription of the deferred date

ushers in such a classification which is impermissible and unacceptable as

it causes discomfort to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_3">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. Quite apart from the

above, it is their submission that life has to be understood in the backdrop

of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_4">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India and on a keener understanding,

this kind of condition is absolutely onerous and does not stand the test of

the summum bonum principle of life inherent under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_5">Article 21</a> of the

Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_25">


</p><p id="p_26">LPA No. 431/2010                                               page 8 of 42
</p><p id="p_27"> 14.    To appreciate the rivalised submissions raised at the Bar, we may

refer with profit to the decision in <a href="/doc/1513693/" id="a_6">L.I.C. of India &amp; Anr. v. Consumer

Education and Research Centre &amp; Ors</a>., AIR 1995 SC 1811 wherein the Life

Insurance Corporation had confined the benefit of availing the policy to

salaried class from government, semi-government or reputed commercial

firms and not to other categories of people. The conditions imposed and

denial to accept the policies were assailed before the High Court as

arbitrary and discriminatory violating Articles 14, 19(1)(g) and right to life

in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_7">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The High Court declared part of the

conditions as valid and the other part, namely, that the proposals for

assurance under the plan would be entertained only from persons in

government or quasi government organization or a reputed commercial

firm which can furnish details of leave taken during the preceding year

under Table 58 as subversive of the equality clause and, therefore,

constitutionally invalid. The Corporation challenged the said decision and

the affected persons also filed cross-appeals. It was contended before the

Apex Court that on acceptance of the proposals by themselves in life

process to create rights in their favour unless a binding contract emerged

by acceptance of the proposal of the insurance and acted upon. It was also

highlighted that the life insurance policies are framed on actuarial

consideration and worked out as per the needs of the policy to suit the

interests of all those interested in obtaining a particular policy and their

viability and hence, the High Court was not justified in interfering with

matters based on economic criteria and commercial contracts. The said

contention was resisted on the foundation that they were contrary to

International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights and the provision

of Part III and also the Directive Principles of State policy. It was also

contended that as the corporation is doing life insurance business, its

policy must be in conformity with the rights in Part III of the Constitution

and the policies engrafted under Part IV and it has no power to impose

any unconstitutional conditions in the contract and no classification much

less valid classification has been made between salaried persons,

                    Macaulay (Formerly Instone), (1974) 1 W.L.R. 1308,
                   House of Lords considered and held that a party to a
                   contract would be relieved from the terms of the
                   contract. In the course of his speech learned Lord
                   Deplock outlined the theory of unreasonableness or
                   unfairness of the bargain to relieve a party from the
                   contract when the relative bargaining power of the
                   parities was not equal. In that case the song writer had
                   contracted with the publisher the terms more onerous
                   to him and favourable to the publisher. The song writer
                   was relieved from the bargain of the contract on the
                   theory of restraint trade opposed to public policy. The
                   distinction was made even in respect of standard forms
                   of contract emphasising that when the parties in a
                   commercial transaction having equal bargaining power
                   have adopted the standard form of contract, it was
                   intended to be binding on the parties. The court would
                   not relieve the party from such a contract but the
                   contracts are between the parties to it, or approved by
                   any organisation representing the interests of the
                   weaker party, they have been directed by that party
                   whose bargaining power, either exercised alone or in
                   conjunction with others providing similar goods or
                   services, enables him to say: "If you want these goods
                   or services at all, these are the only terms on which they
                   are obtainable. Take it or leave it." In Levision v. Steam
                   Carpet Co. Ltd., (1978) 1 Q.B. 69, Lord Denning M.R.
                   reiterated the unreasonable clause in the contract would
                   be applied to the standard form of contract where there
                   was inequality of bargaining power. In Photo
                   Production Ltd. v. Securicor Transport Ltd., 1980 A.C.
                   827, considering the Unfair Contract Terms Act, 1977,
                   Lord Wilberforce during the course of his speech
                   emphasised the unequal bargaining power as an
                   invalidating factor upheld the contract in that case since
                   it was commercial bargain between two competent
                   party to enter into a contract on equal bargaining
                   power. Lord Deplock also reiterated his earlier view.

              view to make the policy viable and easily available to the
              general public, it may be open to the appellants to revise the
              premium in the light of the law declared in this judgment but
              it must not be arbitrary, unjust, excessive and oppressive. Both

<p id="p_29">17.    In Pradeep Kumar Jain v. Citi Bank, (1999) 6 SCC 361, the Apex

Court distinguished a case of general insurance from that of life insurance.

In that context, their Lordships have stated that in case of life insurance

policy, certain sum is agreed to be paid by the insurance company in the

not the situation in case of insurance relating to motor vehicle.

              right up to the conclusion of the contract and also

 insured amount of compensation awarded against him under the

Workmen‟s <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_23">Compensation Act</a>, 1923. S.B. Sinha, J. referred to <a href="/doc/484108/" id="a_24">Section 12</a> of

the Act which provides for the mode and manner of payment of

compensation by a principal employer and/or his contractor. Thereafter,

his Lordship referred to <a href="/doc/1386065/" id="a_25">Section 17</a> of the Act which nullifies contracting

out. In that context, his Lordship stated that an employer is not statutorily

liable to enter into a contract of insurance. Where, however, a contract of

insurance is entered into by and between the employer and the insurer, the

insurer shall be liable to indemnify the employer. The insurer, however,

unlike under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_26">Motor Vehicles Act</a>, does not have a

statutory liability.   <a href="/doc/1386065/" id="a_27">Section 17</a> of the Act does not provide for any

restriction in the matter of contracting out by the employer vis-à-vis the

insurer. Further, the terms of a contract of insurance would depend upon

the volition of the parties. A contract of insurance is governed by the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_28">Insurance Act</a>.      In terms of the provisions of the

<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_29">Insurance Act</a>, an insured is bound to pay premium which is to be

calculated in the manner provided for therein. With a view to minimise

his liability, an employer can contract out so as to make the insurer not

liable as regards indemnifying him in relation to certain matters which do



LPA No. 431/2010                                                page 20 of 42
 not strictly arise out of the mandatory provisions of any statute.

Contracting out, as regards payment of interest by an employer, therefore,

is not prohibited in law. In the said decision, it has been further held that a

contract of insurance is governed by the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_30">Insurance Act</a>.

Unless the said contract is governed by the provisions of a statute, the

parties are free to enter into a contract as per their own volition. Where a

statute does not provide for a compulsory insurance or the extent thereof,

it will bear repetition to state that the parties are free to choose their own

terms of contract and, therefore, contracting out so far as reimbursement of

the amount of interest is concerned is permissible not being prohibited by

the statute.

that every action of the State or public authority or the person whose

interest; that though the insurer is free to evolve a policy based on business

principles, yet the insurance being a social security measure, it should be

consistent with the constitutional animation and conscience of socio-

economic justice enshrined in the Constitution of India; that there is a

distinction between the frontiers of the public law domain and the private

law field; that an unfair and untenable or irrational clause in a contract is

amenable to judicial review; that there are distinctive features between

general insurance and life insurance inasmuch as in case of life insurance

policy, certain sum is agreed to be paid by the insurance company in the

event of the death of the insured or a contingency arising as indicated in

to take on liabilities which they do not want to take on; that if the action of

be scrutinized whether the condition stipulated in the policy, the contract

of insurance, is discriminatory inasmuch as the classification made by the

context, we may refer with profit to a three-Judge Bench decision in <a href="/doc/1535672/" id="a_49">Video

              'discrimination with reason'. The whole doctrine of

              surrounding circumstances brought to the notice of the
              Court on which the classification may reasonably be
              regarded as based, the presumption of constitutionality
              cannot be carried to the extent of always holding that

              subjecting certain individuals or corporations to hostile or

the principle that if a governmental action disclosed arbitrariness, it would

be liable to be invalidated as offending <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_54">Article 14</a> of the Constitution, but

taking into consideration the wider concept, their Lordships held as

follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">              "The wider concept of equality before the law and the
              equal protection of laws is that there shall be equality
              among equals. Even among equals there can be unequal
              treatment based on an intelligible differentia having a
              rational relation to the objects sought to be achieved.
              Consumers' cooperative societies form a distinct class
              by themselves. Benefits and concessions granted to
              them ultimately benefit persons of small means and
              promote social justice in accordance with the directive
              principles. There is an intelligible differentia between
              the retail dealers who are nothing but traders and
              consumers' cooperative societies. The position would
              have been different if there was a monopoly created in
              favour of the later. The scheme only envisages a rule of
              preference. The formulation of the scheme does not
              exclude the retail traders from making an application

<p id="p_62">

</p><p id="p_63">29.    It is worth noting that in the aforesaid case, reliance was placed

upon in Re the Special Courts Bill, (1979) 1 SCC 380 wherein

Chandrachud, C.J., speaking for majority of the Court, adverted to large

number of judicial precedents involving interpretation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_56">Article 14</a> and

culled out several propositions.       The relevant propositions which are

required to be stated for the present case are as follows:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">              "(3) The constitutional command to the State to afford
              equal protection of its laws sets a goal not attainable by
              the invention and application of a precise formula.
              Therefore, classification need not be constituted by an
              exact or scientific exclusion or inclusion of persons or
              things. The courts should not insist on delusive
              exactness or apply doctrinaire tests for determining the
              validity of classification in any given case. Classification
              is justified if it is not palpably arbitrary.</blockquote><p id="p_64">

</p><p id="p_65">              (4) The principle underlying the guarantee of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_57">Article 14</a>
              is not that the same rules of law should be applicable to
              all persons within the Indian territory or that the same
              remedies should be made available to them irrespective
              of differences of circumstances. It only means that all
              persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike


LPA No. 431/2010                                                   page 30 of 42
               both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed.
              Equal laws would have to be applied to all in the same
              situation, and there should be no discrimination
              between one person and another if as regards the
              subject-matter of the legislation their position is
              substantially the same.
</p>
<p id="p_66">              (5) By the process of classification, the State has the
              power of determining who should be regarded as a
              class for purposes of legislation and in relation to a law
              enacted on a particular subject. This power, no doubt, in
              some degree is likely to produce some inequality; but if
              a law deals with the liberties of a number of well
              defined classes, it is not open to the charge of denial of
              equal protection on the ground that it has no
              application to other persons. Classification thus means
              segregation in classes which have a systematic relation,
              usually     found      in   common      properties     and
              characteristics. It postulates a rational basis and does
              not mean herding together of certain persons and
              classes arbitrarily.
</p>
<p id="p_67">              (6) The law can make and set apart the classes according
              to the needs and exigencies of the society and as
              suggested by experience. It can recognize even degree
              of evil, but the classification should never be arbitrary,
              artificial or evasive.
</p>
<p id="p_68">              (7) The classification must not be arbitrary but must be
              rational, that is to say, it must not only be based on
              some qualities or characteristics which are to be found
              in all the persons grouped together and not in others
              who are left out but those qualities or characteristics
              must have a reasonable relation to the object of the
              legislation. In order to pass the test, two conditions
              must be fulfilled, namely, (1) that the classification must
              be founded on an intelligible differentia which
              distinguishes those that are grouped together from

               others and (2) that that differentia must have a rational
              relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act."

              adoption of a policy of the legislature or the executive,
              provided the policy takes care to reasonably classify
              persons for achieving the purpose of the policy and it
              deals equally with all persons belonging to a well
              defined class. It is not open to the charge of denial of
              equal protection on the ground that the new policy does
              not apply to other persons. In order, however, to pass
              the test of permissible classification, as has been laid
              down by the Supreme Court in the catena of its
              decisions, two conditions must be fulfilled; (1) that the
              classification must be founded on an intelligible
              differentia which distinguishes persons or things that
              are grouped together from others left out of the group

<p id="p_70">32.    Keeping in view the aforesaid pronouncements, it is to be scanned

whether the stipulation of „deferred date‟ is unjust and unfair and by

providing such a date, an unreasonable classification has been made

between two categories of policy holders, namely, the policy holders after

a particular age and also period and the policy takers who breathe their

last prior to the said period.
</p>
<p id="p_71">
</p><p id="p_72">33.    The special provision no.2 which we have reproduced hereinbefore

stipulates that if the death of the insured occurs within a period of two

years of the commencement of policy, only the premium paid till that date

LPA No. 431/2010                                               page 33 of 42
 would be payable and nothing more.            The deferred date has been

mentioned in the policy as 14.10.1996. Thus, the submission of the learned

counsel for the appellant is that the stipulation of deferred date in the

policy is neither unfair nor unjust nor unreasonable. It cannot be regarded

as an unconscionable clause in the contract of insurance which plays foul

of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_66">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. It is urged that in the case of a

child, it is not possible to obtain any medical report or special report which

would indicate the expected mortality in respect of life.       The medical

examination is unlikely to reveal an authentic and reliable insight into the

status of health of a child. It is urged by him that the Corporation has to

deal with the risk and uncertainty based on actuarial presumptions and

assumptions while undertaking the risks and carving out exceptions and

exclusions. It is canvassed by him that there is no legal compulsion on

anyone to effect an insurance policy, if the terms and conditions are not

acceptable to him.
</p>
<p id="p_73">
</p><p id="p_74">34.    At this juncture, we may note with profit that in the case of

Consumer Education and Research Centre &amp; Ors (supra), the Life

Insurance Corporation had confined the benefit of availing the policy to

salaried class from government, semi-government or reputed commercial


LPA No. 431/2010                                                 page 34 of 42
 firms and it was not available to other categories of people. In that context,

the Apex Court held that though the insurer is free to evolve a policy

based on business principles and conditions, yet it has to be consistent

with the constitutional philosophy and the conscience of socio-economic

justice. Their Lordships further opined that the classification based on

employment is insidious and has the inevitable effect of excluding lives in

vast rural and urban areas engaged in unorganized or self-employed

sectors which offends <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_67">Article 14</a> of the Constituion of India. It has also

been ruled in the said case that a duty is cast on the Corporation to lay

down stipulations in a policy which are reasonable, just and fair and the

terms and conditions should be accessible to all the segments of the society

for insuring the lives of eligible persons and the eligibility conditions must

be comfortable to the preamble, fundamental rights and directive

principles of the Constitution. In the case at hand, there is no stipulation

by which any particular category or categories of persons have been

excluded.    It is contended that the Corporation has several Children‟s

Deferred    Assurance    policies   intended   to   meet   different    needs,

requirements with different rates of premium and the policies varying

deferred dates for commencement of coverage of risk of death thereunder.



</p><p id="p_75">LPA No. 431/2010                                                 page 35 of 42
 Jeevan Kishor Policy (Plan 102) can be proposed by parents of children

between ages 1 to 12 years. The risk cover commences from the policy

anniversary after attaining the age of seven years or on expiry of a period

of two years from the commencement of the policy, whichever is later.

The deferred assurance policies have lower rates of premium as there is an

initial "claim free" period. At the commencement of the policy, the rate of

premium is lower and the said rate remains constant throughout the entire

term of the policy which may extend to 35 years. As is perceptible from

the analysis of the learned Single Judge, he has compared the figures of

actual claims under Jeevan Kishor Policies for the years 1999-2000, 2000-

2001 and 2001-2002 in respect of children in the age group of 11 years with

those of the other age groups upto 15 years and expressed the view that

the clause is unfair.     We think it appropriate to reproduce the said

paragraph of the order of the learned Single Judge:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_39">              "10. In a further additional affidavit filed by the LIC on
              28th April 2003, the information relating to number of
              Jeevan Kishor Policies issued from 1990-1991 to 2001-
              2002 including the ages of the victims have been given.</blockquote><p id="p_76">
</p><p id="p_77">              Given the large number of Jeevan Kishor Policies issued
              [which stood at 471000 as of 2001-02], the actual claims
              in respect of children in the age group of eleven years
              for the years 1999-2000, 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 are 39,
              55 and 53 respectively. The figures are comparable for


LPA No. 431/2010                                                 page 36 of 42
               other age groups upto 15 years. By no means can it be
              argued that there will be far too many claims against
              the LIC if the "deferred date" clause is not incorporated.
              Given the number of claims being made on a yearly
              basis on account of the deaths of children under the
              Jeevan Kishor Policy, this Court holds that the LIC is
              not acting fairly or reasonably in insisting that no claim
              will be entertained for two years after the
              commencement of the policy."
</p>
<p id="p_78">

</p><p id="p_79">35.    Thus, the learned Single Judge has been guided by the number of

claims. The basic concept, as is understood, pertains to a different area.

The fact of the matter is that the medical report of the children do not

provide reliable guide to future expected mortality and that is the reason

for no medical examination. The deferred payment for commencement of

the risk or waiting period of two years has been postulated. It may bear

repetition that the child is not medically examined. It is also seen that the

rates in the Tables for the policies with deferred dates are lower than those

which are without deferred dates. This is fundamentally an anticipated

policy for the children. It is not a case where a clause is incorporated in the

contract where the bargaining powers of the contracted parties are

different. It is a policy available for a child on a deferred date basis.

</p><p id="p_81"> 36.    The learned senior counsel for the appellant has brought to our

notice the Child Life Insurance Policy which we think it appropriate to

reproduce in entirety:
</p>
<p id="p_82">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_40">              "As the name suggests, child insurance policy or
              children plans means an insurance policy on the lives of
              children, who are not majors. Since the age of child is
              below 18 years, the proposal will have to be made by a
              parent or a guardian.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">              One of the advantages of child insurance plans is that
              the premium which will be considered at the
              commencement of the policy is relatively lower because
              of the young age. Usually, a child insurance plan can be
              purchased when the child is 3 months old (or 91 days of
              age). However, the risk cover on the life of the insured
              child will commence only when the child attains a
              specified age. This clause is according to the rules of
              IRDA (Insurance Regulatory and Development
              Authority). Such a time gap between the date of
              commencement of the insurance policy and the
              commencement of the risk is called the "Deferment
              period". The date, on which the risk will commence, at
              the end of the deferment period is called the "Deferred
              Date".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_42">              Let us explain the basic concept of a child plan with
              Ranjan‟s example. He is 27 years old, married with a 2-</blockquote><p id="p_83">
</p><p id="p_84">              year old daughter. He purchases a child plan for his
              daughter Sameera. Ranjan has now covered his
              daughter under the child insurance plan but her life
              cover doesn‟t start till she is 7 years old. However, the
              plan continues as usual and no mortality charge is
              deducted till Sameera reaches 7 years of age; this is
              because her life cover doesn‟t start till such time. The
              day her life cover starts, i.e. the first policy anniversary


LPA No. 431/2010                                                   page 38 of 42
               after her 7th birthday, is called the Deferred Date. From
              this day onwards the life cover of the child Sameera
              starts, i.e. if she dies after the deferred date her family
              would get the entire sum assured. But if she had died
              before the deferred date, her family would only get
              back the premiums paid and no sum assured would be
              payable. When Sameera attains 18 years of age or any
              later date as may be chosen, the title of the policy
              automatically passes on to her name. This process is
              called as Vesting. Therefore, the day on which the
              policy contract is transferred from Ranjan to Sameera,
              i.e. the first policy anniversary after her 18th birthday, is
              called the Vesting Date. After vesting, the insurance
              policy becomes a contract between the insurance
              company and Sameera.
</p>
<p id="p_85">              This life insurance policy covers the risk of the child‟s
              life. This is a distinctive plan as the entire amount
              payable gets transferred in the name of the child once
              he/ she is 18 years old. Thus it becomes a big asset for
              the child‟s future to take care of various financial
              commitments       and     pursue    higher    education,
              professional courses, develop skill sets, travel places,
              plan other investments and many others."

<p id="p_86">

</p><p id="p_87">37.    At this juncture, we may note a submission of the learned senior

counsel for the appellant that there is a statutory regulatory mechanism,

namely, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA)

under the Insurance Regulatory and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_68">Development Act</a>, 1999.                      An

obligation is cast on the regulatory body to regulate, promote and ensure

orderly growth of the insurance business and reinsurance business.



</p><p id="p_88">LPA No. 431/2010                                                    page 39 of 42
 <a href="/doc/1880542/" id="a_69">Section 14(2)</a> of the Act enumerates the powers and the functions of the

authority. No insurance policy can be introduced in the market or be

modified without prior scrutiny and approval of IRDA. The deferred date

policies for children issued by the LIC have been approved by IRDA. The

same has been based on actuarial and economic policies. It is also worth

noting that there are deferred term policies in Canada and in advanced

countries like United Kingdom, life insurance is not available for those

below the age of 16 years. We have referred to these aspects only to

appreciate the nature of the policy, the bargaining power and the

international phenomenon.     A policy of life insurance is a question of

bonafides and faith. The present policy, as is perceived, does not exclude

anyone to have such a policy for a child. In Consumer Education and

Research Centre &amp; Ors (supra), their Lordships have held that the policy in

issue excluded certain categories of persons as a consequence of which it

defied the constitutional animation and conscience. In the case at hand, it

is not a case of exclusion.
</p>
<p id="p_89">
</p><p id="p_90">38.    It is urged by Mr.Tiku, learned senior counsel for the respondents

that in case of policies under the contract of life insurance and in other

policies where a premium is being paid, the sum assured becomes due and

 there is no question of deferred date. In essence, the submission is that

there is a classification between the policy holders who are not covered by

the deferred date and certain other policy holders who come within the

domain of the deferred date. The deferred date or the waiting period in a

policy and in "Jeevan Kishor Policy" have the following four main

features: (i) it is a policy which covers a child where the physical health

and the medical examination is not done and it is also not possible to find

out the predictability or anticipated certainty of life; (ii) the premium paid

is much lower than the premium which is paid in the normal or other

categories of life insurance policies; (iii) the policy is uniformly applicable

to all children belonging to all stratum of society and it is not that parents

belonging to more financially sound category can pay the premium and

cover the risk of the child for the assured sum without the waiting period

or avoid the deferred date; and (iv) the policy is fundamentally a

protection for the child as eventually there is a concept of vesting after

attaining the age of 18 years.

unreasonable or unconscionable. We may hasten to clarify that we have

referred to the acceptance of the policy by the regulatory body only to

appreciate the submission in proper perspective but we have adverted to

the issue as indicated hereinbefore on the anvil and touchstone of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_70">Article

irresistible conclusion that the conditions incorporated in the "Jeevan

Kishor Policy" withstand nuanced judicial scrutiny and do not cause

discomfort to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_71">Article 14</a> of the Constitution and consequently, the appeal is
