</p><p id="p_3">                  This    application    is   directed   against   the   order   dated
         16.9.2016, passed by the learned Principal Magistrate, Juvenile
         Justice Board, Bokaro in Pindrajora P.S. Case No.54 of 2016, by which
         prayer for bail has been rejected. A further challenge has been made
         to the order dated 6.10.2016, passed in Criminal Appeal No. 61 of
         2016 by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, 1st, Bokaro, by which
         order passed by the learned Principal Magistrate, Juvenile Justice
         Board, Bokaro has been affirmed.
</p><p id="p_4">                  It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the
         petitioner that the allegations made in the FIR have been falsified in
         view of the statement recorded under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_1">section 164</a> Cr.P.C. It has
         further been submitted that medical evidence also belies the
         prosecution case. The petitioner is in remand home since 5.7.2016. It
         has also been submitted that father of the petitioner shall not allow
         the petitioner to come in contact with bad elements and shall also
         take all care and precaution for his well being.

         petitioner.
</p><p id="p_6">             It appears from the statement recorded under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_2">section 164</a> Cr.P.C.
         that the petitioner as well as the victim was caught red handed and
         although efforts were made to solemnize their marriage but
         subsequently on account of refusal on the part of the parents of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                -2-</span>
petitioner, said marriage could not be solemnized. There is no
allegation that the petitioner has forcibly committed rape upon the
victim. The petitioner is in remand home since 5.7.2016. The
statement of the victim girl recorded under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_3">section 164</a> Cr.P.C. has
not been properly appreciated by the learned court below while
refusing to grant bail to the petitioner.

order dated 16.9.2016, passed by the learned Principal Magistrate,
Juvenile Justice Board, Bokaro in Pindrajora P.S. Case No.54 of 2016,
by which prayer for bail has been rejected and order dated
6.10.2016, passed in Criminal Appeal No. 61 of 2016 by the learned

learned Principal Magistrate, Juvenile Justice Board, Bokaro has been
affirmed, are set aside.

on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- (Ten Thousand) only, with two
sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned
Principal Magistrate, Juvenile Justice Board, Bokaro, in connection
with Pindrajora P.S. Case No. 54 of 2016, G.R. No. 938 of 2016, with a
condition that the father of the petitioner will keep the petitioner at a
safe place and will not allow him to meet any bad element and father
of the petitioner is further directed to produce the petitioner before
Juvenile Justice Board, Bokaro on each and every date fixed in the
concerned case, till the conclusion of the inquiry.
