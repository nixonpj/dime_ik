                           KKD COURTS, DELHI


Suit no. 283/10

Parvesh Sahni                                              ........ Plaintiff 

       vs. 

Shisho Devi &amp; Ors.                                         ........ Defendants



ORDER:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.      Vide this order, I shall dispose of the preliminary issue framed by 

this court on 24.05.11 as under :­ 

        Whether the present suit is not maintainable in its present form?  
        OPD


</p><p id="p_2">2.      Brief   conspectus   of   facts   relevant   for   adjudication   of   present 

application as per the plaintiff are that, it is averred by the plaintiff that he 

is the rightful owner of the house bearing no. 331/A­9, Gali no. 1, Raj 

Ghar   Colony,   Delhi   110031   admeasuring   50   sq.   yards   consisting   of 

ground floor and first floor (hereinafter referred to as suit property). It is 

averred that the suit property has been purchased from defendant no. 1 by 

the plaintiff on dated 23.05.1994 and the defendant no. 1 had purchased 

Suit no. 283/10                                                     Page no. 1 of 6
 the suit property from the defendant no. 3 and 4. It is averred that the 

defendant   no.   1   delivered   the   possession   of   the   suit   property   to   the 

plaintiff   after   receiving   the   total   sale   consideration   amount   of   Rs. 

4,00,000/­from him but the documents were prepared with respect to sale 

consideration   amount   of   Rs.   60,000/­   due   to   problem   of   N.O.C. 

Thereafter, the plaintiff let out the suit property to the defendant no.1 on 

30.06.1994   on   rent   at   the   rate   of   Rs.   2,000/­   per   month.   Since   then, 

defendant   no.1   and   her   family   members   are   in   possession   of   the   suit 

property in the capacity of tenant. It is averred by the plaintiff that one 

suit   for   specific   performance   with   respect   to   agreement   to   sell   dated 

23.05.1994 between the parties is already pending in another court. It is 

alleged   by   the   plaintiff   that   defendant   no.   1   in   collusion   with   other 

defendants, is trying to grab the suit property belonging to plaintiff. It is 

further   alleged   that   the   defendant   no.1   had   already   executed   sale 

documents in favour of defendant no.2 during the pendency of the earlier 

suit as mentioned aforesaid. Plaintiff now apprehends that defendant no.2 

is going to further execute the sale documents qua suit property in favour 

of defendant no. 3 and 4 during the pendency of the said suit. 




</p><p id="p_3">Suit no. 283/10                                                         Page no. 2 of 6
</p><p id="p_4"> 3.     It is alleged by the plaintiff that defendant no. 3 and 4 are residing 

in the remaining portion of the suit property in capacity of owner and are 

adamant to demolish the suit property and raise joint construction over 

the suit property belonging to plaintiff and defendant no. 3 and 4. It is 

averred   that   the   plaintiff   made   request   to   defendant   no.   1   and   2   on 

11.03.09 to abstain from creating any 3rd party interest in the suit property, 

but to no avail. It is further avvered that on objections being raised by the 

plaintiff, defendant threatened him with dire consequences. Hence, the 

present suit for permanent injunction and declaration is instituted by the 

plaintiff against the defendants.  
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">4.     Defendant   no   3   and   4   have   already   been   proceeded   ex   parte. 

Defendant no. 1 and 2 in their reply by way of written statement have 

taken preliminary objections that the suit of the plaintiff is liable to be 

dismissed for want of cause of action and on account of suppression of 

material  facts by  the plaintiff. It  is averred by the defendants that  the 

plaintiff was never in possession of suit property at any point of time. It is 

contended that the documents produced by plaintiff which are allegedly 

executed by the defendant no. 1 are forged and fabricated. It is averred by 

the defendants that on the basis of these forged documents, plaintiff filed 

Suit no. 283/10                                                        Page no. 3 of 6
 a suit for specific performance against the defendant with respect to suit 

property   which   was   dismissed   on   merits   by   the   court   of   Sh.   Mukesh 

Kumar, then ld. CJ on 15.09.05. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed an appeal 

against the said decision. However, the said appeal was allowed on the 

ground to provide opportunity to the plaintiff to lead evidence. The said 

suit is still pending between the parties in another court. Defendants have, 

thus, prayed for dismissal of the present suit for want of cause of action 

against them. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">6.     I   have   heard   the   arguments   on   behalf   of   both   the   parties   and 

carefully perused the record. Perusal of the record makes it clear that the 

plaintiff earlier had filed one suit for specific performance in respect of 

agreement to sell dated 23.05.1994 allegedly executed by the defendant 

no.1 in favour of plaintiff in relation to suit property. The said suit was 

dismissed on merits by then ld. Civil Judge on 15.09.05. Although an 

appeal   against   the   said   decision   was   allowed   and   the   matter   was 

remanded back to the trial court for leading of evidence by the parties, the 

matter is still pending for  disposal between the parties. On one hand, the 

question of execution of sale documents qua suit property by defendant 

no.1 in favour of plaintiff is sub judice and on the other hand, plaintiff, 

Suit no. 283/10                                                      Page no. 4 of 6
 while relying upon the strength of the alleged sale of the suit property, is 

claiming rights and injunctory reliefs in lieu of the same. 



</p><p id="p_9">7.     It would be relevant to examine the two suits filed by the plaintiff. 

In the earlier suit filed by the plaintiff the prayer is for a decree of specific 

performance of agreement to sell dated 23.05.1994. In the present suit 

filed by the plaintiff the subject matter of dispute between the parties is 

the  same.   The  plaintiff  has however impleaded defendant  no. 3 and 4 

from whom the defendant no. 1 purchased the suit property as parties. 

The two suits filed by the plaintiff therefore are with respect to the same 

property and the relief claimed by the plaintiff in the present suit could 

have been claimed by the plaintiff by filing an application in the earlier 

suit.  It is important to bear in mind that no relief for injunction can be 

granted when there is an alternative remedy available to the party. In the 

present   case   the   remedy   available   to   the   party   is   to   seek   specific 

performance of the contract and simplicitor a suit for injunction is not 

maintainable in the present case by virtue of <a href="/doc/1835310/" id="a_1">section 41(h)</a> of Specific 

Relief Act, 1963. It is also important to note  that since the plaintiff has 

already filed a case against the defendant for execution of documents in 


Suit no. 283/10                                                      Page no. 5 of 6
 favour   of   the   plaintiff   the   plaintiff   should   have   made   the   prayers   for 

permanent injunction in that suit itself. There is nothing in the present 

suit which could not have been prayed for in the earlier suit filed by the 

plaintiff. The present suit is accordingly barred by provisions of Order 2 

Rule 2 CPC and hence the same is disposed of as dismissed for being not 

maintainable.   This   issue   is   thus   decided   in   favour   of   defendants   and 

against the plaintiff.
