SRIKRISHNA, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	These seven appeals by special leave impugn the common judgment 
rendered by the Division Bench of the Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court 
dismissing a group of writ petitions challenging the acquisition proceedings 
under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_1">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act'). 
The principal contention in the writ petitions before the High Court was that 
the acquisition proceedings were vitiated by discrimination and arbitrariness 
and, thus, violative of the Fundamental Rights under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_2">Article 14</a> of the 
Constitution of India.  Although, seven appeals have been filed in this Court, 
the arguments were addressed by the learned senior counsel appearing for 
the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 5591 of 1999 in the matter of M/s Anand 
Buttons Ltd.  v.  State of Haryana &amp; Ors.. The counsel for the other 
appellants have adopted the arguments addressed in the said case. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">Facts:
</p><p id="p_4">	With a view to achieve the goal of rapid industrialization of the State, 
the State of Haryana constituted the Haryana State Industrial Development 
Corporation as a nodal agency for the development of industrial 
infrastructure in the State.  New integrated industrial parks and estates were 
developed by the state-Corporation keeping in view the Functional Plan 
prepared by the Planning Board for the National Capital Region in 
accordance with the provisions of the National Capital Regional Planning 
Board Act, 1985.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	In order to fulfil the objective set out in the Functional Plan over an 
area of 30,242 Sq. Kms., of which 13,413 Sq. Kms. fell within the Haryana 
sub-region, 41 Industrial Estates of Haryana were targeted for rapid 
industrial development.  Kundli  Industrial Estate was developed in phases 
by acquiring land in accordance with the provisions of the Act. For 
development of Phase-IV, which is located along National Highway No. 1, 
the Government of Haryana (Industries Department) issued a preliminary 
notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_3">Section 4</a> of the Act for acquisition of 93 kanals 10 marlas 
of land (including the lands of the appellants) situated in Village Kundli.  
The appellants filed objections under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_4">Section 5A</a> of the Act, opposing the 
acquisition of their lands on several grounds. The objections raised by the 
appellants were considered by the Land Acquisition Collector, Sonepat, who 
by his report dated 17.1.1997, recommended that the lands of these 
appellants be exempted from acquisition. Being not satisfied with this report, 
the State Government forwarded a copy of this report to the Director of 
Industries, Haryana and asked for his comments.  Simultaneously, the 
District Town Planner of the Haryana State Industrial Development 
Corporation was also entrusted with the task of examining the report of the 
Land Acquisition Collector.  As a result of this exercise, it was 
recommended by the Director of Industries, Haryana as well as the District 
Town Planner of the Haryana State Industrial Development Corporation that 
the lands of M/s Dinar Spinning Mills (P) Ltd., M/s Amar Elastomers (P) 
Ltd. and M/s K.C. Fibre Ltd. may be exempted but the lands of the other 
persons affected by <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_5">Section 4</a> notification be acquired.  The Director of 
Industries also addressed a memo dated 23.4.1997 to the Commissioner and 
Secretary to the Government of Haryana, Industries Department, 
recommending acquisition of land except in the aforesaid three cases.  The 
State Government, after considering the reports submitted to it under  
<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_6">Section 5A</a> of the Act, made a declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_7">Section 6</a> of the Act.  As a 
result of the decision taken by the State Government, the lands of only three 
industrial units, namely, M/s Dinar Spinning Mills (P) Ltd., M/s K.C. Fibre 
Ltd. and M/s Industrial Rollers Co. were exempted from acquisition and the 
lands of all the present appellants were included in the declaration under 
<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_8">Section 6</a> for acquisition.  The present appellants challenged the acquisition 
of their lands by individual writ petitions before the High Court of Punjab &amp; 
Haryana. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">The case made out by M/s Anand Buttons Ltd. (Appellant in Civil 
Appeal No. 5591 of 1999) was that, it had taken several steps in order to 
establish an industry and had expended  considerable amount of time, energy 
and money in pursuing its objective of establishment of an industrial unit.  It 
was pointed out that on 4.3.1994 the appellant had purchased land in Village 
Kundli, Tehsil and District Sonepat for establishing a large and medium 
sector industrial unit for manufacturing of polyster buttons. On 8.3.1994, the 
appellant applied to the Director of Industries for grant of permission for 
change of land use from agriculture to industrial. The Director of Industries 
required from the appellants that before grant of such permission, a path way 
of  33 feet wide strip of land for widening the road, had to be necessarily 
given up in front of the land in order to enable a connecting road to the 
industrial estate. This condition was complied with by the appellant 
company which gifted the said land to the Gram Panchayat, as required by 
the Director of Industries.  On 22.12.1995, the Director of Industries, 
Haryana, granted land use justification certificate in favour of the appellant.  
On 2.7.1996, the appellant was granted permission for change of user of land 
from agriculture to industrial purpose. On 13.8.1996, the appellant submitted 
building plan for approval of construction of its factory building to the 
District Town Planner, Sonepat.  On 26.8.1996, the District Town Planner 
called upon the appellant to pay certain processing fee for clearance of the 
building plans. While this matter was under process, on 14.10.1996, a 
notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_9">Section 4</a> of the Act was issued for acquisition of land, 
which included the land of the appellant, proposed to be developed for the 
purpose of setting up an industrial unit.  On 23.11.1996, the appellant 
submitted a fresh set of building plans along with requisite processing fee to 
the District Town Planner.  The appellant also raised its objections under 
<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_10">Section 5A</a> of the Act.  The Land Acquisition Collector recommended 
exemption of the appellant's land and submitted his report to the Director of 
Industries. This report was considered and rejected in the case of the 
appellant.  The appellant challenged the acquisition proceedings by its writ 
petition, C.W.P. No. 4135 of 1998.  As already said, this writ petition came 
to be dismissed by the common judgment of the High Court. The cases of 
the other appellants are also similar.
</p><p id="p_7">All the appellants had raised objections under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_11">Section 5A</a>, mainly on 
the following two grounds:
</p><p id="p_8">(a)  That each of them had been persuaded to gift 3 Kanals 11 Marlas 
of land to the Gram Panchayat, Kundli for increasing the width of the 
passage with an understanding that they will be granted permission to 
change the user of land. Hence, the Director of Industries and the State 
Government were estopped from acquiring the land in question.
</p>
<p id="p_9">(b) Each of the appellants objected to the acquisition on the ground 
that they are desirous of setting up an industrial unit and, since the 
acquisition was itself intended for setting up of an industrial estate, no 
purpose would be served by acquiring their lands when all the formalities 
had been completed. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">The principal contention advanced by the appellants against the 
acquisition proceedings before the High Court was that the decision of the 
State Government, not to grant exemption from acquisition to their lands, 
was arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_12">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.  
</p>
<p id="p_11">The appellants contended that, in the case of M/s K.C. Fibres and    
M/s Amar Elastomers, exemption had been granted from acquisition, 
although, they were guilty of raising construction on their lands in violation 
of the provisions of Punjab Scheduled Roads and Controlled Areas 
(Restriction of Unregulated Development) Act, 1963. It was urged that the 
appellants, who had strictly followed the law and applied for requisite 
permission and were granted permission, were being discriminated against.  
A subsidiary contention urged was that the State Government should be 
estopped from acquiring the land after having persuaded the appellants to 
give up certain land for a passage as a condition for granting for change of 
user or land.
</p>
<p id="p_12">The High Court has carefully considered and evaluated the 
contentions urged by the petitioners-appellants in the light of the material 
placed before it. The High Court noticed that the cases of all the seven units 
were examined and recommended for exemption from acquisition by the 
Land Acquisition Collector, who was of the view that, each one of the units 
had taken considerable steps towards establishment of an industrial unit. The 
General Manager, District Industries Centre, Sonepat,  after examining the 
individual cases, reported that the facts found in the report of the Land 
Acquisition Collector were correct, but made no recommendation with 
regard to the acquisition proceedings. He reported: "all the parties have been  
heard in person except the representative of M/s Anand Buttons Ltd., who 
did not turn up for verification of the facts on the given date."  The General 
Manager, District Industries Centre pointed out: "all the parties have 
expressed their desire to set up an industry on this land within a period of 
two years, if released. But none of them has so far taken up a tangible step 
on the land. The land of all these parties put together, is surrounded by 
Industrial Area already existing at HSIDC, Kundli. These parties have also 
stated that they would not sell the plot further but will themselves set up an 
industry on it." In the case of M/s Kundli Agro Pvt. Ltd., however, he 
suggested that its case deserves a "sympathetical attitude", in view of the 
land of 3 Kanals and 11 Marlas gifted by it for making a path way. Finally, it 
was reported, "keeping all these things in view, the Headquarter may take a 
suitable action."
</p>
<p id="p_13">The State Government did not file an affidavit in reply to oppose the 
writ petitions, but, instead, authorized the Director of Industries and the 
District Town Planner of the Haryana State Industrial Development 
Corporation to do so.  The affidavits filed by these officers showed that    
M/s Dinar Spinning Mills, M/s Industrial Roller Co. (who were the 
subsequent purchasers of land from M/s Amar Elastomers) and M/s K.C. 
Fibres had, not only constructed the factory building after obtaining the 
permission, but had also started manufacturing of goods.  In all other cases, 
including the case of M/s Anand Buttons Ltd., there were no tangible steps 
taken for erection of factory building, much less had industrial production 
commenced.  The State Government took the view that there was justifiable 
difference between the cases of M/s Dinar Spinning Mills, M/s Industrial 
Roller Co., M/s K.C. Fibres on the one hand and those of the present 
appellants on the other. Although, M/s K.C. Fibres was alleged to have 
carried out a construction in violation of the provisions of the Punjab 
Scheduled Roads and Controlled Areas (Restriction of Unregulated 
Development) Act, 1963 and the Rules framed thereunder, the said illegality 
appears to have been compounded and the construction had been 
regularized.
</p>
<p id="p_14">The affidavits filed by the Director of Industries and the District Town 
Planner also suggest that the acquisition of land was for setting up of Phase-
IV of Industrial Estate, Kundli, which work was being supervised by the 
Haryana State Industrial Development Corporation appointed as the nodal 
agency by the State Government for rapid industrialization of the State.  The 
High Court pointed out that, in these circumstances, the failure of the State 
Government itself to file a return would not be fatal, as the nodal agency, 
who was entrusted with the work, had filed affidavits of the competent 
officers, who were in the know of facts. It also came to the conclusion that 
the action of the Director of Industries, Haryana, calling upon for comments 
from the Haryana State Industrial Development Corporation, and the action 
of the State Government in considering their comments before taking a final 
decision for issuance of the notification under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_13">Section 6</a> of the Act, was 
neither vitiated, nor illegal.  The High Court also noticed that the land of the 
present appellants was sandwiched between Phase-I and Phase-II of the 
Industrial Estate, Kundli. Consequently, leaving a part of the open land 
would jeopardize the planned development of the industrial establishment.
</p>
<p id="p_15"> This reasoning of the High Court cannot be faulted for the simple 
reason that the authority, who has to carry out the planned development of 
the industrial estate, is in the best position to judge as to which land can be 
exempted from the acquisition without jeopardizing the development 
scheme. It is not possible for the court to sit in appeal over the exercise of 
such satisfaction by the authority vested with the task of implementing the 
development plan.
</p>
<p id="p_16">The learned counsel for the appellants urged that the decision taken 
for exempting M/s Dinar Spinning Mills (P) Ltd., M/s Amar Elastomers (P) 
Ltd. and M/s K.C. Fibre Ltd. was not a principled one and that there was no 
uniform yardstick applied for exemption of the said units from acquisition. It 
was urged that, although the State Government had ostensibly decided to 
exempt the said three units on the basis of construction put up and industrial 
units being set up, this was really not true in the case of these three units.  In 
our view, it is unnecessary for us to enter into this controversy.  Even if we 
assume that the three units, who were exempted, did not qualify under the 
standard adopted by the State Government for exemption, at the highest, it 
would make the exemption granted to them vulnerable. None of them was 
made party to the writ petitions filed before the High Court, nor was any 
relief claimed against them. Even assuming that the exemption granted to 
the said three units was erroneous and illegal, <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_14">Article 14</a> does not mandate 
that the appellants should be granted similar illegal and unjustified relief.  As 
said by this Court in <a href="/doc/178226192/" id="a_15">Union of India and Anr.  v.  International Trading 
Co</a>. and Anr. , to which one of us, (Shivaraj V. Patil, J.) was a party, (vide 
Para 13):
</p><p id="p_17">"..It is not necessary to deal with that aspect because 
two wrongs do not make one right. A party cannot claim 
that since something wrong has been done in another 
case direction should be given for doing another wrong.  
It would not be setting a wrong right, but would be 
perpetuating another wrong.  In such matters there is no 
discrimination involved.  The concept of equal treatment 
on the logic of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_16">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India (in 
short "the Constitution) cannot be pressed into service in 
such cases.  What the concept of equal treatment 
presupposes is existence of similar legal foothold.  It 
does not countenance repetition of a wrong action to 
bring both wrongs on a par.  Even if hypothetically it is 
accepted that a wrong has been committed in some other 
cases by introducing a concept of negative equality the 
respondents cannot strengthen their case.  They have to 
establish strength of their case on some other basis and 
not by claiming negative equality."
</p>
<p id="p_18">It is trite law that not only land but also structure on land can be 
acquired under the Act. As to whether in a given set of circumstances certain 
land should be exempted from acquisition only for the reason that some 
construction had been carried out, is a matter of policy, and not of law.  If 
after considering all the circumstances, the State Government has taken the 
view that exemption of the lands of the appellants would render askew the 
development scheme of the industrial estate, it is not possible for the High 
Court or this Court to interfere with the satisfaction of the concerned 
authorities.  We see no ground on which the appellants could have 
maintained that their lands should be exempted from acquisition.  Even if 
three of the parties had been wrongly exempted from acquisition, that gives 
no right to the appellants to seek similar relief.
</p>
<p id="p_19">It is rightly pointed out by the High Court that, merely because a 
representation was made by the Director, Town and Country Planning, that 
upon gift of certain land to the Gram Panchayat for widening of the passage, 
permission for change of user of land would be granted, such a promise is 
not one capable of being enforced against the State Government. The High 
Court has rightly pointed out that, if the appellants are so desirous, they may 
seek invalidation of the gifts in favour of the Gram Panchayat on the ground 
of failure of the Director, Town and Country Planning to fulfil his 
commitment. That, however, does not render the acquisition proceedings 
illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_20">No other ground has been made out. In our view, therefore, no fault 
can be found with the judgment rendered by the Division Bench.  We find 
no merit in the appeals, which are hereby dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_21">No order as to costs.
