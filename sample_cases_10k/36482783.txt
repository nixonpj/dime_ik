     THIS CRIMINAL PETITION IS FILED UNDER SECTION

RESPECT       OF     CRIME        NO.77/2015    OF
CHENNAMMANAKERE ACHUKATTU POLICE STATION,
BANGALORE CITY FOR OFFENCES U/S 306 R/W 34 OF
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a> WITH A DIRECTION TO RELEASE THEM ON BAIL IN
THE EVENT OF ARREST, ON SUCH TERMS AND
CONDITIONS.

     THIS CRIMINAL PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                        ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and

the learned Government Pleader.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.    Petitioner   No.1   is   the   legally   wedded

husband of petitioner No.2. They are accused in Crime

No.77/2015 on the file of respondent police station.

The offences alleged against both of them is punishable

under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_2">Section 306</a> r/w <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">Section 34</a> of IPC.


</p><p id="p_4">     3.    On the basis of the first information lodged

by Smt. Kavitha, wife of deceased Sathish, case is

registered against both of them.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3</span><p id="p_5">


</p><p id="p_6">      4.    According     to       the   first   information,

complainant's husband Sathish was a partner in a

security agency firm alongwith both the accused and

the partnership firm suffered loss.        It is alleged that

both the petitioners pressurized her husband to make

good the loss in its entirety and they were often coming

and pressurizing him.     it is also mentioned that they

were scolding him by using filthy language.            Being

unable to withstand the humiliation meted out to him,

her husband committed suicide.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">      5.    Learned Government Pleader has vehemently

opposed the bail application on the ground that a death

note has been left by the deceased and these accused

will have to be interrogated with reference to the death

note. He has further argued that investigation is still in

progress and therefore it is not a fit case to grant bail.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                4</span>


</p><p id="p_9">     6.     Admittedly, the second petitioner is a lady

and she has undertaken to obey any conditions which

may be imposed on her. So far as the first petitioner is

concerned, there is a reference in the death note and he

needs to be interrogated by the police with reference to

the same.    In the light of the investigation being in

progress, petitioner No.1 is not entitled to be released

on bail under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_4">Section 438</a> of Cr.P.C. at this stage.


</p><p id="p_10">     7.     Accordingly, the petition is partly allowed

granting anticipatory bail to petitioner No.2 Smt. Roopa

only on the following conditions.


</p><p id="p_11">     (1) Petitioner    shall       be   released   on
          anticipatory bail in the event of his
          arrest in Cr.No.77/2015 by respondent
          Police, on her executing a personal bond
          for a sum of ` 1,00,000/- with one
          surety for the likesum to the satisfaction
          of the Investigation Officer.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    5</span><p id="p_12">


      (2) Petitioner shall surrender before the
            Investigation        Officer   on     or     before
            14.04.2015 and in such an event, the
            I.O. may orally interrogate him.              Soon
            after conducting interrogation, he shall
            release      the      petitioner       on      bail,
            immediately.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      (3) Petitioner shall not holdout threats to
            the prosecution witnesses and shall not
            try to lure them in any manner.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      (4) Petitioner shall not involve herself in any
            criminal activities.
</p>
<p id="p_15">

      The     petition   filed     by   the    first    petitioner   is

dismissed. He is entitled to approach this Court directly

under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_5">Section 439</a> of Cr.P.C. after surrendering before

the police.
