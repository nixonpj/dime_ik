                      BEFORE

            M.F.A. No.2316/2016 (MVC)

BETWEEN:

Sri. Manjunatha
S/o Kempanna
Aged about 32 years
Residing at Anandhnagar,
1st Cross, Shanthinagar,
Vijayapura, Devanahalli Taluk
Bengaluru District-562 110.

                                        ... Appellant
(By Sri K.N. Harish Babu, Advocate)

AND:

The Managing Director,
K.S.R.T.C. Double Road,
Shanthi Nagar,
Bengaluru-560 027.
                                      ... Respondent
(By Sri G. Shankar Goud, Advocate)

      This MFA is filed under <a href="/doc/93665491/" id="a_1">Section 173(1)</a> of the
MV Act against the judgment and award dated
03.12.2015 passed in MVC No.4397/2014 on the file
of the 12th Additional Small Causes Judge &amp; Member,
MACT, Bengaluru, partly allowing the claim petition
for Compensation and seeking enhancement of
compensation.
                                -2-


     This MFA coming on for hearing this day, the
Court delivered the following:-

                    JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The present appeal has been preferred by the

appellant-claimant being aggrieved by the judgment

and award passed by the MACT, Bengaluru, in MVC

No.4397/2014 dated 3.12.2015.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2. Heard the learned counsel appearing for both

sides.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      3. The brief facts of the case are that on

19.8.2014     at   about    12.30    p.m.   the   claimant

Manjunatha was proceeding on a motor bike bearing

registration No.KA-02 EL 8592 along with his wife as

a pillion rider. When they came near Melur village, a

bus bearing registration No.KA-40 F-688 came rashly

and negligently and the conductor of the said bus

suddenly opened the door without stopping the bus

and the door dashed against the motor bike on which

the petitioner was proceeding. As a result of which,

he   fell   down   and     sustained   grievous   injuries.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              -3-</span>


Immediately, he was shifted to Government hospital,

Sidlaghatta and later he was shifted to KIMS hospital,

admitted as an inpatient and he has been operated. It

is the contention of the petitioner-claimant that he

was doing coolie work and getting a monthly income

of Rs.10,000/- per month. He filed a claim petition

under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_2">Section 166</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act to claim

the compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">     4. In response to the notice, the respondent

appeared and filed written statement by denying the

contents of the petition. He further contended that

the petitioner himself is responsible for the alleged

accident and he is not entitled for any compensation.

He further contended that the petitioner has falsely

implicated the bus in colluding with the police by

concocting the documents. On these grounds he

prayed for dismissal of the said petition.


</p><p id="p_8">     5. On the basis of the above pleadings the

Tribunal has framed the following issues:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            -4-</span>


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     1. Whether the petitioner proves that he has
        sustained grievous injuries as mentioned in
        column No.11, in a road traffic accident on
        19.8.2014 at about 12.30 p.m. near Meluru
        village, Sidlaghatta Taluk, Chickballapura
        District, due to the rash and negligent
        driving of the driver of the KSRTC bus
        bearing registration No.KA-40 F-688?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     2. Whether   petitioner     is   entitled   for   any
        compensation? If so to what extent and from
        whom?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     3. What Order or Award?
</blockquote>


<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     6. In order to prove the case of the petitioner-
</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">claimant, he examined himself as PW1 and examined

one witness Dr.Kumar M. as PW2 and got marked the

documents Exs.P1 to P14. On behalf of respondent

Corporation the driver of the bus came to be

examined as RW1. No documents have been got

marked. After hearing the parties to the lis, the

impugned judgment and award came to be passed.

For having not satisfied with the compensation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                -5-</span>


awarded by the Tribunal, the present appeal has

been filed by the appellant-claimant.


</p><p id="p_10">        7. The main grounds urged by the learned

counsel for the appellant-claimant are that the

claimant has been admitted in the hospital for more

than 18 days and he has undergone ORIF for his leg

and the doctor has assessed the disability at the rate

of 27% to the lower limb and 9% to the whole body.

But the Tribunal has erroneously took the disability

at 6% and has passed the award on the lower side.

He has further contended that the compensation

awarded under the head of pain and sufferings, loss

of amenities and loss of future earnings are on the

lower     side.   He    further      contended    that   no

compensation      has   been      awarded   for   attendant

charges, nutrition and diet separately. On these

grounds he prayed for allowing the appeal by

enhancing the compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">        8. Per contra, the learned counsel appearing on

behalf of the respondent-Corporation vehemently
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                -6-</span>


argued by contending that the compensation awarded

by the Tribunal is on the higher side and the

claimant has suffered only one fracture and in that

light the Tribunal has rightly taken 6% disability and

has awarded the just compensation. On these

grounds he prayed for dismissal of the appeal.


</p><p id="p_13">      9. As could be seen from the judgment and

award and the wound certificate Ex.P9, the claimant

has suffered compound fracture of Malleolus of Right

Ankle and other multiple abrasions all over the body.

In order to establish that the claimant has suffered

disability,   the   claimant   has   got   produced   the

disability certificate as per Ex.P13 and he has also

examined      PW2-Dr.Kumar      M. According to       PW2

Doctor, the appellant has sustained permanent

physical disability to an extent of 27% to a lower limb

and 9% to the whole body. The Tribunal by taking the

notional income at the rate of Rs.6,000/- has

awarded the total compensation of Rs.2,22,840/-

under the following heads;
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                -7-</span><p id="p_14">


</p><p id="p_15">                                               Amount (Rs.)

   Pain and sufferings                           40,000-00

   Loss of income during laid up period          18,000-00
   Medical bills                                 55,040-00
   Loss of future earnings                       64,800-00
   Loss of amenities, conveyance, food           30,000-00
   and nourishment, attendant charges
   etc.</p><pre id="pre_2">
   Future medical expenses                       15,000-00
                Total                          2,22,840-00



</pre><p id="p_16">      10. Though under normal circumstances, the

compensation awarded appears to be justifiable, at

the time of taking disability, the Tribunal ought to

have taken 1/3rd of the disability keeping in view the

evidence of PW2. When PW2 has specifically deposed

that the disability assessed to the lower limb is 27%

and disability to the whole body is 9%, without any

justifiable   cause,    the   Tribunal   has   taken    6%

disability to the whole body, that appears to be not

justifiable and the accident is of the year 2014. Even

for the purpose of settlement of cases before the Lok-

Adalath, the notional income at Rs.8,500/- will be

the criteria. Then under such circumstances, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 -8-</span>


Tribunal ought to have taken the notional income at

the      rate   of    Rs.8,500/-      and    awarded         the

compensation. Keeping in           view     the above        said

circumstances, the appellant-claimant has entitled to

the re-assessed compensation as mentioned below:

</p><p id="p_17">                                                Amount (Rs.)

  Towards pain and sufferings                      40,000/-
  Loss of income during laid up period             25,500/-
</p><pre id="pre_3">  Medical bills                                    55,040/-
  Loss of future earnings                       1,37,700/-
  Loss of amenities and discomforts                30,000/-
  Towards        attendant,   food,                10,000/-
</pre><p id="p_18">  nourishment, conveyance and other
  incidental charges
  Future medical expenses                          15,000/-
</p><p id="p_19">                 Total                          3,13,240/-
</p>
<p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">      11. In that light, the appellant-claimant is

entitled to a total compensation of Rs.3,13,240/-.

Since,      already      the   Tribunal      has       awarded

compensation of Rs.2,22,840/-, after deducting the

same,     the   appellant-claimant     is   entitled    to    an

additional compensation of Rs.90,400/- with 8%

interest as awarded by the Tribunal.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                              -9-</span>


</p><p id="p_22">        12. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in part.

The judgment and award passed by the Tribunal in

MVC No.4397/2014 dated 3.12.2015 is modified as

indicated above.
