<p id="p_10">    3.          Indisputably, the petitioner has been working in the said

    capacity till date. The petitioner had earlier approached the Tribunal





    for regularization of her services and reference was decided in her

    favour vide award dated 16.1.2007. However, the said award was





    challenged by the respondents by medium of CWP No. 259 of 2007

    and the matter was remitted back to the Tribunal for considering two

    communications annexed as Annexures R-6 and R-7, respectively.


    The Tribunal below vide its award dated 28.3.2013 rejected the claim

    of the petitioner on the ground that she is an employee of Red Cross


    Society, and therefore, her services cannot be regularized.

</p><p id="p_11">    4.          The petitioner has challenged this award on the ground




    that after having worked w.e.f. 10.1.1989, it was legitimate that her

    have raised preliminary objection regarding maintainability of the

</p>
<p id="p_17">    Even before this Court, the only contention raised by the respondents

    to defeat the legitimate claim of the petitioner is that respondent No.1





    i.e. the Indian Red Cross Society is not the State within the meaning

    of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_1">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India and thus is not amenable to





    the writ jurisdiction of this Court.

    a State and amenable to writ jurisdiction is no longer res-integra in


    view of the judgment of the learned Single Judge of Punjab and

    Haryana High Court in Pant Raj Sachdev vs. The Indian Red Cross


    Society and others, 1986 (1) SLR 675, which in turn has been

    affirmed by a Division Bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court in




    The District Red Cross Society, Sirsa vs. Radha Kishan Rajpal





    and another, 2005 (1) SLR, 781, <a href="/doc/1786580/" id="a_2">Om Parkash Sharma vs. Indian

    and Haryana High Court, it can conveniently be held that respondent

    No.1 is amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court and if that be so,

    it cannot shirk from its responsibility and liability for ensuring that a

    fair and reasonable treatment be meted out to the petitioner.

         allowed to ride roughshod over the weak? Should the courts


         sit back and watch supinely while the strong trample under-
         foot the rights of the weak? We have a Constitution for our
         country. Our judges are bound by their oath to "uphold the




         Constitution and the laws". The Constitution was enacted to
         secure to all the citizens of this country social and economic





         justice. <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_7">Article 14</a> of the Constitution guarantees to all
         persons equality before the law and the equal protection of





         the laws. The principle deducible from the above discussions
         on this part of the case is in consonance with right and

         all bargains of this type. No court can visualize the different

        unreasonable that it shocks the conscious of this Court. It reflects
        the inequality of the bargaining power between the appellant and
        the respondents which emanates from the great disparity in the
        economic strength between the job seeker and job giver.

        the offer made by the respondents, but then the mere acceptance
        of this offer would not give it a stamp of approval regarding its
        validity. It is an age old maxim that "necessity knows no law" and a
        person sometimes may have to succumb to pressure of the other
        party to bargain who is in stronger position.          Although, it may not
        be strictly in place, but the Court cannot shut its eyes to this ground
