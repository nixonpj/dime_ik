     CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHUTOSH KUMAR
                       ORAL JUDGMENT
     Date : 21-06-2019

                 Heard Mr. Suraj Narayan Yadav, learned

      advocate for the petitioner and Mr. Nadeem Seraj,

      learned G.P.-5.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                 2. The petitioner has challenged the order

      dated 09.06.2014 contained in Memo No. 3034 issued

      under the signature of Principal Secretary, Government

      of Bihar, Patna whereby the memorial/revision of the

      petitioner has been rejected as also the order dated
 Patna High Court CWJC No.1515 of 2017 dt.21-06-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           2/7</span>




         04.08.2011 passed in service appeal against the order

         dated 20.12.2010 passed by the Disciplinary Authority,

         reverting the petitioner to the lowest stage of his post,

         which too was dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                    3. The case of the petitioner has a long history.

</p><p id="p_13">                    4. The petitioner was served with the charge of

         having allowed unauthorized persons to enter the jail

         premises on 23.04.2002. The petitioner was subjected

         to a departmental proceeding in which the Disciplinary

         Authority slapped the petitioner with a punishment of

         reversion       to     the     basic         pay    vide    order   dated

         12.01.2003. The petitioner preferred an appeal against

         the aforesaid order in which the order of punishment

         by the Disciplinary Authority was set aside by order

         dated 21.04.2004 and the case was remanded to the

         Disciplinary Authority to conduct the proceedings afresh

         and pass a reasoned order in accordance with law.

         Thereafter, the Disciplinary Authority, vide order dated

         20.12.2010,           issued        under          the     signature   of
 Patna High Court CWJC No.1515 of 2017 dt.21-06-2019

         Superintendent of Central Jail, Bhagalpur, passed an

         order reverting the petitioner to his basic pay.

</p><p id="p_14">                    5. This order viz. the order dated 20.12.2010

         was challenged by the petitioner before this Court vide

         C.W.J.C. No. 13164 of 2008 which was rejected on

         19.05.2011. While rejecting the writ petition, a Bench

         of this Court held that the facts of the case disclosed

         that the petitioner had admitted that he had allowed

         five unauthorized persons to enter the jail premises.

         The Court took note of the fact that the Superintendent

         of Jail and the Assistant Jailor were in-charge of safety

         and administration of jail premises and that the

         responsibility did not lay squarely on the shoulders of

         the petitioner. Nonetheless, the Bench refused to

         interfere with the order of punishment. However, a

         liberty was given to him to avail of his statutory right

         of appeal. The Bench also directed that in case the

         statutory period for preferring an appeal had lapsed,

         such aspect be considered favourably by the Appellate
 Patna High Court CWJC No.1515 of 2017 dt.21-06-2019

         Authority.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                    6. Pursuant to such a direction and concession

         given by this Court, an appeal was filed against the

         order of punishment, which stood rejected. The

         memorial/ revision against the aforesaid order passed

         in appeal also stood rejected as noticed above.

</p><p id="p_16">                    7. Mr. Suraj Narayan Yadav, learned advocate

         for the petitioner, apart from harping on the ground

         that it was not only the petitioner who was responsible

         for the unauthorized entry of certain persons in jail

         premises but the responsibility lay on the head of

         others as well, further castigated the orders impugned

         on the ground that those persons who were equally

         responsible, if not less than the petitioner, were served

         with     minor       punishments             as   compared   to   the

         punishment meted out to him. He therefore submits

         that at all stages of the proceedings, he was put at the

         farthest end of the stick and different treatment was

         meted out to him. This, according to the learned
 Patna High Court CWJC No.1515 of 2017 dt.21-06-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                           5/7</span>




         advocate for the petitioner was vindictive and with the

         sole purpose of singling out the petitioner by saddling

         and punishing him for the aforesaid charge.

</p><p id="p_17">                    8. Mr. Nadim Seraj, learned advocate for the

         State however has submitted that this defence of the

         petitioner was taken note of by the High Court in the

         year 2011 but the ground that others also are

         responsible for the unauthorized entry of persons in the

         jail could not have come to the avail of the petitioner

         as the petitioner also could not be absolved of his

         responsibility of the safety of the jail premises. He has

         further submitted that there is no concept of equality

         so far as the determination of guilt is concerned and

         such parity could only have been agitated by the

         petitioner with respect to the quantum of sentence

         imposed upon other accomplices of the petitioner. The

         aforesaid issue was never been agitated and even in

         this petition, it has not been stated whether the other

         functionaries of the jail were subjected to disciplinary
 Patna High Court CWJC No.1515 of 2017 dt.21-06-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                           6/7</span>




         proceeding along with the petitioner and whether

         materials collected against them were any different so

         as to justify the nature of punishment given to the

         petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                    9. In the absence of such grounds having been

         taken by the petitioner all this while in the whole gamut

         of proceedings, it would not be open for the petitioner

         now to agitate such grounds after so many years and

         after the petitioner has superannuated from service.

</p><p id="p_19">                    10. The submissions made on behalf of the

         State appear to be forceful in as much as the conduct

         of the others would not be an indice for deciding what

         punishment is required to be given to the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_20">                    11. This Court has no idea about the nature of

         charge against others to adjudicate/hold that the

         punishment to the petitioner was different and harsher

         than others.
</p>
<p id="p_21">                    12. This Court finds that the order does not

         suffer from the vice of harsh punishment which is
             Patna High Court CWJC No.1515 of 2017 dt.21-06-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                       7/7</span>




                     disproportionate to the nature of lapse on the part of

                     the petitioner. The allegations against the petitioner

                     cannot be said to be a flea bite. The safety of the jail is

                     dependent on the diligent performance of duty by the

                     jail functionaries, specially the petitioner, who at the

                     relevant time was a Warden.
</p>
<p id="p_22">                                13. This Court finds no reason to interfere with

                     the orders passed in appeal and revision which have

                     been impugned in the present petition.

</p><p id="p_23">                                14. The petition stands dismissed.
