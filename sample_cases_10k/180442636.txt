ORDER DATED:20/03/2012 PASSED BY THE RESPONDENT NO.3,

VIDE ANNEXURE-E AND ETC.,


      THESE WRIT PETITIONS COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THIS

DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
                                 :4:




                               ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        Both these writ petitions are directed against the

order of Karnataka Sanskrit University dated 25.03.2013

continuing the term of Administrator namely Dean,

Karnataka Sanskrit University (Linguistic Faculty) on the

ground that it is contrary to 2nd proviso of sub section

(1) of Section 67 of the Karnataka Education Act, 1983

(for short 'the Act').
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.      A perusal of the said proviso would clearly indicate

that if the State Government is of the opinion and in

order     to   secure    the    proper   management   of   an

educational institution, it can appoint an Administrator

for one year and it may issue direction for continuation

of such arrangement for a total period not exceeding

two years.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.      Undisputedly, in the instant case, Administrator

was     appointed       on   19.03.2012    and   subsequently
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              :5:</span>




continued by order dated 25.03.2013 Annexure-D (in

W.P.No.77832/2013). Petitioner in W.P.No.62633/2012

has   also   filed   an   application   IA-II/2013   seeking

permission to amend the writ petition by inserting

additional grounds and also for additional prayer which

relates to quashing of the order dated 25.03.2013.        In

other words, both the petitioners have sought for

quashing of the order dated 25.03.2013. Undisputedly,

period of two years has lapsed and even the period

mentioned in the impugned order (25.03.2013) has also

got spent itself.    Thus, quashing of the said impugned

orders would be an empty formality or in other words it

would be academic in nature. As such, said prayer

sought for, is not being granted by this Court.


</p><p id="p_6">4.    However, the incidental question that would arise

in these writ petitions is as to who should be handed

over the Management since there are rival claims each

claiming to be valid Trust and Trustees.      Undisputedly,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                :6:</span>




petitioner in W.P.No.77832/2013 namely the Chairman

of   the   said   petitioner-Trust   has    filed   a   suit   in

O.S.No.575/2011 against Sri Aravind Maltesh Mugadur

and Sri Yellappa D. Navalgund for declaration and

injunction. It is also not in dispute that petitioner-Trust

in W.P.No.62633/2012 claiming to be represented by its

Chairman Sri Ningappa and contending that Sri Aravind

Maltesh     Mugadur      has     executed      a    registered

supplementary Trust deed appointing him as the sole

Trustee has sought for quashing of impugned order

dated 25.03.2013.       In other words, there are rival

claims to the Trust in question and the matter is now

seized by the Civil Court.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">5.    The Administrator who had been appointed by the

Karnataka Sanskrit University cannot be continued since

there is a bar under the Statute namely 2nd proviso to

sub section (1) of Section 67 of the Act restricting time

of two years for an Administrator being continued.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             :7:</span>




However, institution being aided institution and number

of students having continued their studies they would be

put to jeopardy, if, rival Trusts are allowed to have their

dispute continued in the premises of the Colleges which

are being run by the Trust.       For the past two years,

Administrator has continued at the helm of affairs of the

petitioner-Trust under whose banner 4 institutions are

said to be under administration and management.

Hence, there being a bar under the Statute to continue

the Administrator and the interest of the students

requiring to be safeguarded as also the properties of the

Trust, I am of the view that, if, Administrator is

continued as a receiver, it would meet the ends of

justice more particularly when the learned advocates

appearing for both parties have filed a joint memo

expressing    their    willingness    to   continue    the

Administrator as receiver of the institution.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               :8:</span>




</p><p id="p_9">6.     Joint memo filed by the learned advocates is

placed on record and it is hereby ordered that the

Administrator namely the Dean, Karnataka Sanskrit

University (Linguistic Faculty), shall continue as receiver

of the Trust and he shall administer the institutions

under its management till the dispute is resolved finally

in the civil court and it is needless to state receiver will

be bound by the outcome of decision that would be

rendered by the Civil Court.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">       Ordered accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_12">


</p><p id="p_13">                                     (sd/-)
                                     JUDGE
