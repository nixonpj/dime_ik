<pre id="pre_1">        THE HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE RAMESH RANGANATHAN</pre>

<p id="p_1">                                       AND

                THE HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE N.BALAYOGI

                       WRIT PETITION NO.27284 OF 2018

ORDER: {Per the Hon'ble Sri Justice Ramesh Ranganathan}

         Heard Sri Anand Kumar Kapoor, learned counsel for the

petitioner. The proceedings under challenge in this Writ Petition is

the charge memo dated 31.08.2017 whereby the petitioner was

called upon to show cause why disciplinary proceedings should not

be held against him with respect to the said charges.                      The

explanation submitted by the petitioner was not accepted, and an

Enquiry Officer was appointed to enquire into the charges.

</p><p id="p_2">         Sri Anand Kumar Kapoor, learned counsel for the petitioner,

would submit that, since the charge sheet relates to a judicial

order      passed      by   the   petitioner,   the   scope   of   disciplinary

proceedings, initiated pursuant thereto, is extremely limited; while

an erroneous judicial order can be corrected in an appeal or in

revision, that would not justify disciplinary proceedings being

initiated against him; it is only in the limited circumstances, as

laid down by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1878631/" id="a_1">Ramesh Chander Singh v.

High</a> Court of Allahabad1, that disciplinary proceedings can be

taken against an officer for a judicial order passed by him; the

Calendar Case, in which the petitioner had issued a non-bailable

warrant (NBW), was earlier dismissed; it was only on a revision

filed thereagainst in Crl.R.P.No.7 of 2014 was the order set aside,

and the matter remanded to the petitioner who was the Principal



1   (2007) 4 SCC 247
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>




Junior Civil Judge-cum-V Metropolitan Magistrate, Cyberabad at

Medchal; the special vakalat filed on behalf of the first accused

earlier, when C.C.No.456 of 2016 was pending before him, ceased

to remain in force on the dismissal of C.C.No.456 of 2016; the

petitioner was, therefore, justified in issuing an NBW since the

summons issued earlier was not claimed by the first accused; and

the impugned show cause notice, therefore, necessitates being set

aside.
</p>
<p id="p_3">         It would be wholly inappropriate for us to examine the truth

or otherwise of the allegations levelled against the petitioner, in the

charge memo and the statements of imputations, since disciplinary

proceedings are still pending.     The present Writ Petition is filed

questioning the validity of the charge memo issued earlier.        The

allegations in the charge memo, and the statements of imputations

and allegations based on which the charge memo was issued, are

that the petitioner had issued a non-bailable warrant to accused

No.1, an N.R.I., a U.S. citizen and a practising doctor in the United

States of America; the petitioner had, before ordering NBWs, failed

to consider whether summons sent to accused No.1 at the

Hyderabad address were returned unclaimed; and he had also not

verified whether the permission granted to accused No.1, to be

represented by a special vakalat holder, was in force or not before

issuing NBW against accused No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         The question which necessitates examination, in these

proceedings, is whether the disciplinary proceedings initiated

against the petitioner would fall within the parameters laid down in

Ramesh Chander Singh1 wherein the Supreme Court held that for

the High Court to initiate disciplinary proceedings, there should be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   3</span>




strong grounds to suspect the officer's bona fides, and the order

itself should be actuated by malice, bias or illegality.        The

allegations levelled against the petitioner, if true, may render the

judicial order passed by him illegal in terms of the aforesaid

judgment of the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      Even otherwise, in Ramesh Chander Singh1, disciplinary

proceedings were initiated against the petitioner therein; an

enquiry was held thereafter; a notice was issued to him asking him

to show cause why punishment of stoppage of two increments with

cumulative effect should not be imposed on him; thereafter, the

matter was placed before the Full Court of the High Court which

imposed the major punishment of stoppage of two increments with

cumulative effect; and it is only on conclusion of disciplinary

proceedings, after punishment was imposed, and on the order of

punishment being subject to challenge, did the Supreme Court

examine whether the decision to initiate disciplinary proceedings,

based solely on a complaint the contents of which were not

believed to be true by the High Court, was justified.

</p><p id="p_6">      Unlike in Ramesh Chander Singh1, the contents of the

complaint have not been disbelieved by the High Court in the

present case. In any event, the entire issue is only at the stage of

an enquiry, and it is always open to the petitioner to put forth his

defence during the course of enquiry, including placing reliance on

the judgment of the Supreme Court in Ramesh Chander Singh1.

Suffice it to observe that the allegations levelled against the

petitioner, if presumed to be true, are not such as to warrant the

charge sheet being quashed, even before completion of the

disciplinary enquiry. It is made clear that we have not expressed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4</span>




any opinion on the truth or otherwise of the allegations levelled in

the charge memo against the petitioner, as these are all matters for

examination during the course of the departmental enquiry. We,

however, see no reason to interdict the disciplinary proceedings

initiated against the petitioner and leave all contentions, including

those raised in this Writ Petition, open for examination, if need be,

in appropriate legal proceedings instituted by the petitioner after

conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings.

</p><p id="p_7">      Subject to the aforesaid observations, the Writ Petition fails

and is, accordingly, dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.

Miscellaneous petitions, if any, pending shall stand dismissed.
