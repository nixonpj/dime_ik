       IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT
                      CHANDIGARH


                                                    CWP No. 13824 of 2016
                                                 Date of decision: 11.07.2017

Bijender                                                         ....Petitioner(s)


                                    Versus

Chaudhary Devi Lal Cooperative Sugar Mills Ltd. and another
                                                         ...Respondent(s)

CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE G.S.SANDHAWALIA

Present:      Mr. Harish Bhardwaj, Advocate,
              for the petitioner.

              Mr. Deepak Balyan, Advocate,
              for the respondents.

G.S.SANDHAWALIA, J. (Oral)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">              The present judgment shall dispose of three writ petitions i.e.

CWP Nos. 13824, 17739 and 17740 of 2016 as common questions of facts

and law are involved in all the writ petitions. For reference, CWP No.

13824 of 2016, Bijender vs. Chaudhary Devi Lal Cooperative Sugar Mills

Ltd. and another is being taken up.
</p>
<p id="p_2">              Challenge in the present writ petition is to the order dated

20.04.2016 (Annexure P-10) whereby, the petitioner has been reverted back

to the post of Khalasi (Regular Permanent) from the post of Fitter-III

(Electric).
</p>
<p id="p_3">              It is not disputed that prior to the issuance of the impugned

order, a show cause notice dated 08.09.2015 (Annexure P-8) was issued to

the petitioner by the Managing Director of the respondent. The petitioner

filed his reply dated 18.09.2016 (Annexure P-9) whereby, he gave his

 CWP No. 13824 of 2016 and other connected cases                             2


explanation as to why the show cause notice be filed.            The Managing

Director passed the reversion order on the cursory reasoning that the reply is

not satisfactory and accordingly the petitioner was reverted back to his

previous post. Resultantly, the order cannot be termed as non-speaking and

without containing any reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            It is settled principle that even a administrative order has to

contain reasons. Reference can be made to the judgment of the Apex Court

in <a href="/doc/1304475/" id="a_1">M/s. Kranti Associates Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Sh. Masood Ahmed

Khan and others</a>, 2010 (9) SCC 496 wherein the following principles have

been laid down:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                   "a. In India the judicial trend has always been to
            record reasons, even in administrative decisions, if such
            decisions affect anyone prejudicially.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                   b. A quasi-judicial authority must record reasons
            in support of its conclusions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                   c. Insistence on recording of reasons is meant to
            serve the wider principle of justice that justice must not
            only be done it must also appear to be done as well.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                   d. Recording of reasons also operates as a valid
            restraint on any possible arbitrary exercise of judicial
            and quasi-judicial or even administrative power.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                   e. Reasons reassure that discretion has been
            exercised by the decision maker on relevant grounds
            and by disregarding extraneous considerations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                   f. Reasons have virtually become as indispensable
            a component of a decision making process as observing
            principles of natural justice by judicial, quasi-judicial
            and even by administrative bodies.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                   g. Reasons facilitate the process of judicial
            review by superior Courts.</blockquote>

                  h. The ongoing judicial trend in all countries
           committed to rule of law and constitutional governance
           is in favour of reasoned decisions based on relevant
           facts. This is virtually the life blood of judicial decision
           making justifying the principle that reason is the soul of
           justice.
</p><p id="p_6">                  i. Judicial or even quasi-judicial opinions these
           days can be as different as the judges and authorities
           who deliver them. All these decisions serve one common
           purpose which is to demonstrate by reason that the
           relevant factors have been objectively considered. This
           is important for sustaining the litigants' faith in the
           justice delivery system.
</p><p id="p_7">                  j. Insistence on reason is a requirement for both
           judicial accountability and transparency.
</p><p id="p_8">                  k. If a Judge or a quasi-judicial authority is not
           candid enough about his/her decision making process
           then it is impossible to know whether the person
           deciding is faithful to the doctrine of precedent or to
           principles of incrementalism.
</p><p id="p_9">                  l. Reasons in support of decisions must be cogent,
           clear and succinct. A pretence of reasons or `rubber-
           stamp reasons' is not to be equated with a valid decision
           making process.
</p><p id="p_10">                  m. It cannot be doubted that transparency is the
           sine qua non of restraint on abuse of judicial powers.
           Transparency in decision making not only makes the
           judges and decision makers less prone to errors but also
           makes them subject to broader scrutiny. (See David
           Shapiro in Defence of Judicial Candor (1987) 100
           Harward Law Review 731-737).
</p><p id="p_11">                  n. Since the requirement to record reasons
           emanates from the broad doctrine of fairness in
           decision making, the said requirement is now virtually a

             component of human rights and was considered part of
             Strasbourg Jurisprudence. See (1994) 19 EHRR 553, at
             562 para 29 and Anya vs. University of Oxford, 2001
             EWCA Civ 405, wherein the Court referred to <a href="/doc/19636/" id="a_2">Article
             6</a> of European Convention of Human Rights which
             requires, "adequate and intelligent reasons must be
             given for judicial decisions".
</p><p id="p_12">                   o. In all common law jurisdictions judgments play
             a vital role in setting up precedents for the future.
             Therefore, for development of law, requirement of
             giving reasons for the decision is of the essence and is
             virtually a part of "Due Process".
</p>
<p id="p_13">             Counsel for the respondents has very fairly conceded that in

similar circumstances in CWP No. 13641 of 2016, <a href="/doc/111762415/" id="a_3">Rakesh vs. Chaudhary

Devi Lal Cooperative Sugar Mills Ltd</a>. decided on 12.05.2017, similar

relief was granted and the order was set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_14">             Accordingly, the present writ petitions are allowed.       Order

dated 20.04.2016 (Annexure P-10) is set aside. However, liberty is granted

to the Managing Director of the respondent to pass a fresh order, if so

warranted and decide the issue afresh, if so desired.
