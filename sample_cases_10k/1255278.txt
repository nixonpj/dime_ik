Change of rest days from Sunday to another day-No notice  to
workmen-If legal.



HEADNOTE:
The  Coal Mines Provident Fund and Bonus Scheme	 Act,  1948,
was  enacted  for  making provision for	 the  framing  of  a
provident fund scheme and bonus scheme for persons  employed
in  coal mines.	 <a href="/doc/746513/" id="a_3">Section 5</a> of the Act empowers	the  Central
Government  to frame the Coal Mines Bonus Scheme  which	 may
provide	 for  all or any of the matters-specified  in  third
schedule  to  the Act.	Item 7 of the  schedule	 extends  to
matters which may be necessary or proper for the purpose  of
implementing the Scheme.
Paragraph 8 of the Coal Mines Bonus Scheme provides for	 the
effect of participation in an illegal strike, and, in case a
dispute arises as to whether the strike is illegal or  legal
for the purpose of the scheme, which authority and according
to what procedure, is to decide that dispute.
In 1963, due to shortage of power, the appellant decided  to
stagger	 weekly rest days in all its collieries.  In one  of
them,  Wednesday, and in another, Thursday, were  introduced
as  rest  days instead of Sundays.  The change was  to	take
effect	from September 22, which was a Sunday.	The  workmen
failed to turn up for work on that Sunday as well as on	 the
next Sunday, September 29.  When they turned up for work  on
Wednesday,  September  25, at one colliery and	on  Thursday
September  26,	at the other colliery they  were  told	that
those  days  were weekly rest days and on that	ground	they
were   not  given  any	work.	The  appellant	filed	four
applications  before the Regional Labour  Commissioner,	 who
was  the  authority  under para 8 of the  Coal	Mines  Bonus
Scheme for a declaration that there was an illegal strike by
the  workmen on the Sundays on which they failed to turn  up
for work.  The respondents filed two applications before the
same authority stating that there was an illegal lockout  on
September  25  and  September  26  at  the  two	  collieries
respectively.	The  Regional Labour  Commissioner  held  in
favour of the workmen that there was no illegal strike.	 The
order  was  confirmed in appeal by  the	 Central  Industrial
Tribunal and in writ petitions, by the High Court.
In appeal to this Court, it was contended that : (1) para  8
of  the Scheme creating a quasi judicial tribunal was  ultra
vires and that such a tribunal could only be created by	 the
Legislature;  and (2) that change in the rest days  did	 not
effect	any change in the conditions of service of  Workmen
in respect of any matter specified in the Fourth Schedule to
the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_4">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947 and hence notice of change
of  rest  days to workmen under<a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_5"> s. 9A</a> of that  Act  was	 not
necessary.
Dismissing the appeal.
HELD   :  (1)  (a)  The	 increasing  complexity	 of   modern
administrations	 and  the need for  flexibility	 capable  of
rapid readjustment to meet the changing circumstances, which
cannot always be foreseen, in implementing the socioeconomic
policy, pursuant to the establishment of a welfare state  as
contemplated   by   the	 Constitution,	have   rendered	  it
convenient,,  practical and necessary, for the	legislatures
to  have  frequent  resort to  the  practice  of  delegating
subsidiary or ancillary powers to delegates of their choice.
Parliamentary procedure and discussion in getting through  a
legislative  measure  is time-consuming, and  such  measures
cannot	provide	 for all possible  contingencies  since	 one
cannot	visualise the various permutations and	combinations
of  human  conduct  and behaviour.  But	 the  delegation  of
legislative  power is permissible only when the	 legislative
policy	and  principle	is  adequately	laid  down  and	 the
delegate  is  Only  empowered to carry	out  the  subsidiary
policy	within the guidelines laid down by the	legislature.
The  legislature cannot abdicate its authority	and'  cannot
pass   to   some   other  body	the   obligation   and	 the
responsibility	imposed on it by the Constitution.   It	 can
only utilise other bodies or authorities for the purpose  of
working out the details within the essential principles laid
(town  by  it.	Therefore, it has to be seen if there  is  a
delegation of the essential legislative 'function, or if  it
is merely a case in which some authority or body, other than
the legislature, is empowered to work out the subsidiary and
ancilliary  details within the essential guidelines,  policy
and  principles	 laid down by the legislative  wing  of	 the
Government. [603H; 604A-E]
(b)In the present case, the relevant schedule read with<a href="/doc/746513/" id="a_6"> s.
5</a>  of  the, Coal Mines Provident Fund and Bonus	 Scheme	 Act
clearly	 lays down the policy and principle for framing	 the
scheme.	  Paragraph  8 of the scheme is a matter  of  detail
which is subsidiary or ancilliary to the main purpose of the
legislative  measure for implementing the scheme.   It	par-
takes  of  the	character  of  subordinate  legislation	  on
ancilliary  matters within the conditions laid down  in	 the
Act by<a href="/doc/746513/" id="a_7"> s. 5</a> read with the relevant schedule.  Paragraph 8 of
the scheme is accordingly valid and cannot be considered  to
amount to excessive delegation of legislative power.
[604E-H]
(2)(a)	<a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_8">Section 9A</a> of the Industrial Disputes  Act,  1947,
provides that noemployer  who  proposes	 to  effect  any
change in the conditions of serviceapplicable  to   any
workman	 in  respect of any matter specified in	 the  Fourth
Schedule  shall effect such change without giving notice  to
the  workmen  likely to be affected by such  change  in	 the
prescribed manner.  Items 4. 5 and 8 of the Fourth  Schedule
refer to hours of work and rest intervals, leave with  wages
and  holidays and withdrawal of any customary concession  or
privilege or change 'in usage; respectively.  The expression
'hours of work and Test interval.,;' and 'leave' with  wages
and  holidays' are wide enough to cover the case of  illegal
strikes	 and  rest  days.   The	 expression  'withdrawal  of
customary  concession  or privilege or change in  usage'  is
also  wide  enough  to take within its fold  the  change  of
weekly	holidays from Sunday to some other day of the  week.
[604H; 605A-C]
(b)The real object and purpose of the section is to afford
an opportunity to the workmen to consider the effect of	 the
proposed change and. if necessary, to represent their  point
of  view on the proposal.  Such consultation further  serves
to stimulate   timulate	  a feeling of common joint interest
of  the	 management and workmen in industrial  progress	 and
increased  productivity.  This approach on the part  of	 the
industrial   employer  would  reflect  his  harmonious	 and
sympathetic cooperation in improving the status and  dignity
of   the   industrial  employee	 in  accordance	  with	 the
egalitarian   and  progressive	trend  of   our	  industrial
jurisprudence which
 596
strives	 to  treat capital and labour as co-sharers  and  to
break  away from the tradition of labour's  subservience  to
capital.   In  order  to  effectively  achieve	the   object
underlying <a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_9"> s. 9A</a>, it would be more appropriate to place  on
the  Fourth  Schedule  read with<a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_10"> s.  9A</a>	 of  the  Industrial
Disputes Act a construction liberal enough to include change
of  weekly  rest days from Sundays to some other  week	day.
[605F-H]
(c)It  is no doubt true that whether the paid day of  rest
is  Sunday or some other week day would cause  no  financial
loss to the workmen.  But financial benefit cannot be  said
to  be the sole criterion in considering the  question.	  It
should	not  be	 ignored that due to long  usage  and  other
factors Sunday as a holiday may for conceivable reasons have
assumed importance for workmen and it may also have  special
significance  because,	on Sunday, when their  school  going
children  have a holiday, the entire family may be  able  to
take  part in recreational or other social activities.	[605
C-F]
(d)<a href="/doc/482050/" id="a_11">Sections  2(f)</a>, <a href="/doc/70494/" id="a_12">52</a> and <a href="/doc/540440/" id="a_13">63</a> of the Factories  Act,  1948,
also  fortify  the  view  that	it  is	not  immaterial	  or
unimportant whether workmen are given a Sunday or some other
week day as a weekly rest day., [606A-C]
(3)The	appellant  having thus effected a  change  in  the
weekly	days of rest without complying with<a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_14"> s. 9A</a> read	with
the  Fourth  Schedule,	the  change  must  be  held  to	  be
ineffective and the previous schedule of weekly day% of rest
must  be  held	to  be	still  operative.   Therefore,	 the
appellant's  contention	 that  the  workmen  concerned	 had
resorted  to illegal strike on September 22 and 29, must  be
rejected, and the respondents' contention that the appellant
had illegally declined to give work to them on September  25
and  26	 and that the appellant had declared a lock  out  on
those  two  days which was illegal, has to  be	upheld.	  No
doubt,	mere refusal to give work does not by itself  amount
to  lock-out;  but in the present case, when  the  employers
closed	the two collieries respectively on September 25	 and
26 they knew that this change in the weekly days of rest was
not acceptable to a considerable section of the workmen	 who
had  not come to work on Sunday, September 22.	The  closure
of  collieries	on  the	 two  days  in	question  was	thus
deliberate.   Coal  having been declared  a  public  utility
service	 and notice of closure at contemplated by S., 22  of
the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_15">Industrial Disputes Act</a> not having been given, the	lock
out was illegal under<a href="/doc/1042042/" id="a_16"> s. 24</a> of the Act. [606F-H; 607 A-B]

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
Dua,  J.-These	six appeals on certificate  granted  by	 the
Patna High Court in two separate judgments disposing of	 six
civil writ petitions raise common questions of fact and	 law
and will, therefore, be disposed of by a common judgment.
The  appellant owns six collieries, but we are concerned  in
the  present controversy only with two	collieries,  namely,
Sijua  'and  Bhelatand.	  Due  to  shortage  of	 power,	 the
appellant decid-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">597</span>
<p id="p_5">ed  to stagger the weekely rest days in all the	 collieries.
By a notice dated September 10, 1963 a new schedule of	rest
days, was introduced in accordance with which Sijua colliery
was  to	 have every Wednesday as a rest day and	 Bhelat	 and
colliery every Friday as a rest day.  With respect to Bhelat
and  colliery Friday was later changed to Thursday.   It  is
common ground that previously Sunday was the weekly rest day
in all the six collieries.  The change in the weekly days of
rest was to take effect from September 15, 1963 which was  a
Sunday.	  The workers of the collieries did not turn up	 for
work   on   Sunday  September  15,  as	a   result   whereof
negotiations were held between the appellant and some of the
workmen represented by the Colliery Mazdoor Sangh and it was
agreed	that  the  new	schedule  would	 take  effect	from
September  22, 1963.  It may here be pointed out  that	the-
respondents  in these appeals, who were also respondents  in
the  High  Court in the six writ petitions, are	 members  of
another	 union called the Congress Mazdoor Sangh  which	 was
not  a party to that agreement.	 The said agreement was	 not
given  full  effect, with the result that on  September	 22,
1963,  again,  the workers did not turn up for work  in	 the
collieries.  The appellant thereupon filed two	applications
under sub-para (1) of para 8 of the Coal Mines Bonus  Scheme
(hereinafter referred to as the Scheme) before the  Regional
Labour	Commissioner  for a declaration that there,  was  an
illegal strike on September 22, 1963.  Even after  September
22,  1963,  the controversy between the	 appellant  and	 the
workmen	 continued and on Wednesday, September 25, 1963	 the
workmen	 went  to Sijua Colliery for  work.   The  appellant
refused	 to give them any work on the plea  that  Wednesday
was a weekly day of rest in that colliery.  Similarly,	when
the  workmen  went  on	Thursday,  September  26,  1963	  to
Bhelatand Colliery they were told that Thursday was a weekly
rest  day and on this ground they were not given  any  work.
Shri B. N. Sharma, President of the Congress Mazdoor  Sangh,
Bihar,	Jorapokhar,  Dhanbad, on behalf of  the	 workmen  of
Sijua  and  Bhelatand  Collieries,  filed  two	applications
before	the  Regional  Labour  Commissioner  (C),   Dhanbad,
stating	 that there was illegal lock-out of the	 workers  of
Sijua  Colliery on September 25, 1963 and of the workers  of
Bhelatand  Colliery on September 26, 1963 and that the	said
lock-outs  should  be declared,illegal for the	purposes  of
the, scheme.
</p><p id="p_6">The  Regional  Labour Commissioner decided  the	 two  appli-
cations filed by Shri B. N. Sharma in respect of the alleged
lock-out of workers of Sijua and Bhelatand Collieries by  an
order dated November 22, 1963 and held that the	 non-working
of  Sijua Bhelatand Collieries on September 25 and 26,	1963
respectively  was due to a lock-out, which was	illegal	 for
pur-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">598</span>
<p id="p_7">poses  of  the	Scheme.	  It may be  pointed  out  that	 the
appellant had also filed four more applications relating  to
the failure of the workmen to work on September 15 and 29 in
the   two  collieries  which  means  that  there  were	 six
applications   before  the  Regional   Labour	Commissioner
(Central),   Dhanbad   filed  by   the	 appellant   seeking
declaration   that  the	 workers  of  Sijua  and   Bhelatand
Collieries  had resorted to strike on September 15,  22	 and
29, 1963 which should be declared as illegal for purposes of
the Scheme.  The applications relating to the strike on Sep-
tember 15, 1963 both at Sijua and Bhelatand Collieries being
declared  as  illegal were later withdrawn in  view  of	 the
agreement  dated  September 18, 1963, with the	result	that
only  four  applications by the	 appellant  were  ultimately
adjudicated upon by the Regional Labour Commissioner who, by
an  order dated November 14, 1964, gave a  declaration	that
there  was  no strike, much less an illegal strike,  by	 the
workers	 on September 22 and 29, 1963.	This conclusion	 was
arrived	 at on the basis of the finding that change  in	 the
weekly days of rest was not in accordance with law.
The  appellant appealed to the Central Industrial  Tribunal,
Dhanbad	 in  all  the  six  matters,  but  without  success.
Aggrieved  by these decisions, the appellant approached	 the
Patna  High Court by means of six writ petitions which	were
disposed  of by two separate orders both dated November	 16,
1966.	In one judgment, the High Court dealt with the	four
writ  petitions	 complaining of illegal strike	and  in	 the
other  with  the two writ petitions complaining	 of  illegal
lock-out.   The	 High  Court  upheld  the  decision  of	 the
Regional   Labour  Commissioner	 as  also  of  the   Central
Industrial  Tribunal  on appeal, and dismissed all  the	 six
writ  petitions.   It  is in these  circumstances  that	 the
present six appeals Iron &amp; Steel Company Limited.
The principal question which requires consideration though
Its  importance, as pointed out by both sides, lies  in	 the
fact  that  the Bonus provided under the Scheme	 depends  on
attendance  and if it is held that the workers had  resorted
to illegal strike, then they would be deprived of bonus for
a  quarter of the year.	 The main argument raised on  behalf
of the appellant centres round the construction to be placed
on <a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_17"> s.	9A</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, No. XIV  of	1947
(hereinafter called the Act), which deals with the notice of
change in the conditions of service 'applicable to a workman
in  respect of matters specified in the Fourth	Schedule  to
the  Act.   If	notice	contemplated  by  this	section	 was
necessary,  which admittedly was not given, then the  change
in  the new schedule of rest days was not according  to	 law
and the workers
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> 599</span>
were, justified in ignoring the change.	 <a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_18">Sections 9A</a> and  <a href="/doc/1549308/" id="a_19">9B</a>
alone  constitute Chapter II-A which was introduced  in	 the
Act  by means of Act no. 36, of 1955 which came into  effect
on March 10, 1957.  These two sections read as under :-
9A.  "Notice of change: No employer, who proposes to  effect
any  chance in the conditions of service applicable  to	 any
workman	 in  respect of any matter specified in	 the  Fourth

</p><p id="p_8">(a)  without giving to the workmen likely to be affected  by

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">600</span>
<p id="p_12">According to the appellant, there was no change in the	con-
ditions	 of service applicable to the workmen in respect  of
any  item  falling  in the Fourth Schedule.   Here,  we	 may
reproduce  only three items out of eleven contained  in	 the
Fourth	 Schedule   because  according	to   the   arguments '
addressed  at  the bar, these were the only  three  entries
considered to be relevant.  These entries are nos. 4, 5	 and
8 and they read as under
</p><p id="p_13">4.   Hours of work and rest intervals;
</p><p id="p_14">5.   Leave-with wages and holidays; and
</p><p id="p_15">8.   Withdrawal of any customary concession or privilege  or
change in usage".
</p><p id="p_16">The  arguments	forcibly pressed by Shri Pai in	 this  Court
broadly speaking, proceeded thus :
</p><p id="p_17">The  change in the schedule of rest days did not effect	 any
change	in  the	 conditions of	service	 applicable  to	 any
workman	 in  respect of any matter specified in	 the  Fourth
Schedule.  It was due to an emergency created by  unforeseen
circumstances  beyond the appellant's control  resulting  in
power  shortage that the appellant was compelled to  stagger
the weekly days of rest in the six collieries, including the
two collieries concerned in these appeals.  The basic  cause
as  disclosed in 'annexure A' to the writ petition was	that
on account of heavy percolation of water, power off take  to
the  colleries had reached its peak and the power-house	 was
no  more  able to cope with  the additional  requirements.
Further	 running  of  the  power-house	in  the	  overloaded
condition  was	also likely to result in break-down  at	 the
power station, thereby totally cutting off the power supply.
For  this reason it became absolutely necessary	 to  stagger
the  weekly days of rest in the six collieries and  also  in
the Coal Washery at Jamadoba.  By staggering the weekly days
of rest, according to the argument, the daily load of power
was intended to be reduced on the power station.  There	 was
no  financial  loss  to the workers because it	was  only  a
change	of weekly rest day from Sunday to Wednesday  in	 one
colliery  and  from Sunday to Thursday in the  other.	This
change in the weekly rest days remained subject to the	same
conditions  of service.	 The workers were under the  changed
schedule  entitled  to one and half time  the  wages,  where
applicable,  only it called to work on the newly fixed	days
of  rest.   As it was an emergency measure which was  to  be
short-lived, it was physically impossible to give notice  of
21  days  as  contemplated by cl. (b) of <a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_21"> s.  9A</a>.   In	this
connection  emphasis was laid on the fact that on  September
27,  1963 a "General Notice" was issued by  the	 appellant's
Chief  Mining Inspector, Shri R. N. Sharma,  notifying	that
the  defects  at  the  Power  House  had  been	successfully
attended to with the result that old schedule of working was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">601</span>
restored.   In any event, the staggering of weekly  days  of
rest, Contended Shri Pai, did not fall under any item of the
Fourth	Schedule to the Act.  The counsel explained that  it
could  not  fall under item 4 because the  expression  "rest
intervals"  contemplates intervals during the working  hours
in the course of a single day and not the weekly rest days :
it  could also not fall under item 5 because the  change  in
question  has  nothing to do with either holidays  or  leave
with  wages : item 8 would also be inapplicable	 because  it
did not amount to withdrawal of any customary concession  or
privilege or to change in usage.
</p><p id="p_18">The  appellant, as a subsidiary point, also  challenged	 the
vires  of  para 8 of- the Scheme contending that  this	para
creates	 a quasi-judicial Tribunal and such a  Tribunal	 can
only  be created by the legislature and not by an  executive
flat  and  that<a href="/doc/1229456/" id="a_22"> s. 5</a> of the Coal Mines	Provident  Fund	 and
Bonus  Schemes	Act (No. 46 of 1948), which  authorises	 the
Central Government to frame the Scheme, does not empower the
Central	  Government,  either  expressly  or  by   necessary
implication, to create such a Tribunal.	 This challenge	 was
pressed with some force and wag also elaborated though it is
interesting to note that it was the appellant company itself
which approched the regional Labour Commissioner under	this
very paragraph for relief by means of four applications	 and
on   feeling  aggrieved	 by  the  adverse  orders   of	 the
Commissioner in these four matters and in the two matters in
which	the  appellant	had  unsuccessfully  contested	 the
workmen's  applications	 seeking  declaration  of  ill.-,gal
lock-outs  on September 25 and 26, 1963, took these  matters
on  appeal to the Central Industrial Tribunal.	 Instead  of
ignoring these Tribunals or questioning the legality of	 the
appointment  of the Regional Labour Commissioner and of	 the
Central	  Industrial   Tribunal,  the	appellant,   it	  is
noteworthy,  preferred	to  take  the  chance  of  obtaining
favourable orders from them.
</p><p id="p_19">All these arguments were countered on behalf of the  respon-
dents  and it was contended that the appellant had from	 the
very  inception visualized the difficulties created  by	 the
heavy percolation of water to last for a period of six weeks
as  would be clear from the appellant's notice.	 If that  be
so,  then, it is futile to contend that the emergency  being
short-lived,  21  days'	 notice could not be  given  by	 the
appellant.  But assuming that the emergency was short  lived
and there was 'a difficulty in giving the requisite  notice,
the  appellant,	 which is a prosperous concern,	 could	have
paid wages to the workers and laid them off for one day in a
week  in order to avoid over-loading of the  power  station.
This would have in any event served to promote the  goodwill
and  harmonious co-operation between the management and	 the
labour, ultimately leading to more helpful understanding  of
the common difficulties
</p><p id="p_20">-Ll52SuppCI/73
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">602</span>
facing the industry, in the prosperity of which both of them
as  co-sharers should feel equally interested.	 This  would
accord with the industrial jurisprudence as it has developed
in  our country since 1950 under inspiration from the  broad
guidelines  afforded by the industrial relations  policy  as
envisaged  in our Constitution.	 In so far as the  items  of
the  Fourth Schedule to the Act are concerned, according  to
the  respondents,  Sunday as a weekly rest  day,  was  being
granted to the workers of these two collieries as indeed  it
was being granted to the workers of all the collieries owned
by  the	 appellant,  on the basis of old  usage	 within	 the
contemplation  of item no. 8. This matter also falls  within
the  expression	 "rest	interval"'  used  in  item  no.	  4,
proceeded  the contention, because the subject of "hours  of
work  and  rest intervals" contemplated by  this  entry	 can
reasonably be construed to include both "daily hours of work
and  rest  intervals"  and "weekly hours of  work  and	rest
intervals".   Besides, the question of weekly rest days	 can
also  fall  within  item no. 5 because	it  is	inextricably
connected  with	 the  question of holidays  and	 leave	with
wages,	the  weekly  rest day being a  holiday	with  wages.
Paragraph 8 of the Scheme, according to the respondents,  is
also  intra vires because item no. 7 of the  third  schedule
read  with<a href="/doc/1229456/" id="a_23"> S. 5</a> of the Coal Mines Provident Fund  and  Bonus
Schemes	 Act,  1948 contemplates that the  Scheme  can	also
provide	 for any matter which may be necessary or pro-.	 per
for  the  purpose of implementing the Scheme.	Now  if	 any
dispute	 arises about the payment of bonus depending on	 the
attendance  of an employee in accordance with the  terms  of
the Scheme, then, according to item 7 of the Third Schedule,
settlement of such a dispute may legitimately be  considered
to  be necessary or proper for the purpose  of	implementing
the  Scheme.   Constitution of a Tribunal  and	laying	down
procedure  for	the proceedings before such a  Tribunal	 for
adjudicating  upon  such a dispute would, according  to	 the
respondents,  contention, fall within item no. 7 and  would,
therefore, be intra vires.
</p><p id="p_21">Dealing with the last point first, the Coal Mines  Provident
Fund  and  Bonus  Scheme Act, 46  of  1948,  was  originally
enacted for making provision for the framing of a  Provident
Fund  Scheme and Bonus Scheme for persons employed  in	coal
mines.	in 1971 the Purpose of this Act was extended to	 the
framing of a family bonus Scheme but that amendment does not
concern us.

</p><p id="p_32">Item no. 7, it may be noticed, extends to matters which	 may

Scheme.
</p><p id="p_33">Now, the increasing complexity of modern administration	 and
the  need for flexibility capable of rapid  readjustment  to
meet	 changing  circumstances,  which  cannot  always   be
foreseen, in implementing our socioeconomic policy, pursuant
to  the establishment of a welfare State as contemplated  by
our Constitution,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">604</span>
have  rendered it convenient and practical, nay,  necessary,
for the legislatures to have frequent resort to the practice
of delegating subsidiary or ancillary powers to delegates of
their  choice,.	 The parliamentary procedure and  discussion
in getting through a legislative measure in the legislatures
is  usually  time-consuming.  Again, such  measures  cannot-
provide	 for all possible contingencies because	 one  cannot
visualize  various  permutations and combinations  of  human
conduct	 and  behaviour.  This explains	 the  necessity	 for
delegated or conditional legislation.  Due to the  challenge
of  the	 complex  socioeconomic	 problems  requiring  speedy
solution  the  power  of delegation has by now,	 as  per  in
necessity, become a constituent element of legislative power
as  a whole.  The legal position as regards the	 limitations
on  this  power	 is,  however,	no  longer  in	doubt.	 The
delegation  of legislative power, is permissible  only	when
the legislative policy and principle is adequately laid down
and  the  delegate  is	only  empowered	 to  carry  out	 the
subsidiary  policy  within the guidelines laid down  by	 the
legislature.   The  legislature, it must be borne  in  mind,
cannot	abdicate  its authority and cannot pass on  to	some
other body the obligation and the responsibility imposed  on
it by the Constitution.	 It can only utilise other bodies or
authorities  for  the, purpose of working  out	the  details
within	the essential principles laid down by it.   In	each
case, therefore, it has to be seen it there is delegation of
the essential legislative function or if it is merely a Case
in  which some authority or body other than the	 legislature
is  empowered  to  work out  the  subsidiary  and  ancillary
details	  within   the	essential   guidelines,	  policy-and
principles,  laid  down	 by  the  legislative  wing  of	 the
Government.  In the present case the relevant schedule	read
with<a href="/doc/746513/" id="a_26"> s. 5</a> of Act No. 46 of 1948 clearly lays down the policy
and  the  principle for framing the Scheme.  Para 8  of	 the
Coal   Mines  Bonus  Scheme  provides  for  the	 effect	  of
participation  in  illegal  strike and, in  case  a  dispute
arises	as to whether a strike is legal or illegal  for	 the
purposes  of the scheme, which authority, and  according  to
what  procedure,  is to decide that dispute.  This,  in	 our
view, is a matter of detail which is subsidiary or ancillary
to   the  main	purpose	 of  the  legislative  measure	 for
implementing  the Scheme.  It partakes of the  character  of
subordinate legislation on ancillary matters falling  within
the  conditions laid down in the aforesaid Act by<a href="/doc/746513/" id="a_27"> s. 5</a>	read
with  the  relevant  Schedule.	 Para 8	 of  the  Scheme  is
accordingly  valid and it cannot be considered to amount  to
excessive delegation of legislative power.  The challenge on
this score is, therefore, devoid of merit.
We  now come to the main contention.  <a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_28">Section 9A</a>  which	 has
already	 been  reproduced,  lays down  that  change  in	 the
conditions of service in respect of any matter specified  in
the Fourth Schedule shall not have effect unless a notice is
given to the workmen
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">605</span>
likely to be affected by such change.  The relevant  entries
of  the	 Fourth Schedule have already been  reproduced.	  It
appears	 to us that entries dealing with "hours of work	 and
rest  intervals"  and' "leave with wages and  holidays"	 are
wide  enough to cover the case of illegal strikes  and	rest
days.	Indeed,	 entry	no. 8 dealing  with  "withdrawal  of
customary  concession  or privilege or change in  usage"  is
also  wide  enough  to take within its fold  the  change  of
weekly	holidays from Sunday to some other day of the  week,
because	 it seems to us to be a plausible argument  to	urge
that  fixation of Sundays as weekly rest days is founded  on
usage  and/or  is treated as a customary privilege  and	 any
change	in  such  weekly  holidays  would  fall	 within	 the
expressions "change in. usage" or "customary privilege".
We are not unmindful of the force of the argument pressed on
behalf	of the appellant that if a holiday is  changed	from
Sun-.  day  to some other week day it would not	 affect	 the
material gain or financial benefit available to the  workmen
because	 the workmen would nontheless get one day  off	with
pay in a week.	Whether the paid day of rest is a Sunday  or
some  other week day would no doubt cause no financial	loss
to  the	 workmen.  But the financial benefit cannot  be	 the
sole  criterion	 in  considering  this	question.  in	this
connection it must not be ignored that due to long usage and
other  factors	Sunday	as a  holiday  may  for	 conceivable
reasons	 have assumed importance for workmen.	For  certain
classes of workmen Sunday as a weekly rest day may also have
special	 significance.	 Workmen  may,	for  example,	also
generally  like	 to have weekly rest day on  a	Sunday	when
their  school  going  children have a holiday  so  that	 the
entire	family may be able to take part in  recreational  or
other  social  activities.  This consideration has  its	 own
importance.  If that be so, then, notice for effecting	such
a change would be within the contemplation of<a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_29"> s.  9A</a>.	 The
real  object  and purpose of enacting<a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_30"> S. 9A</a> seems to  be  to
afford an opportunity to the workmen to consider the  effect
of   the  proposed  change and, if necessary,  to  represent
their point of view  on	 the  proposal.	  Such	consultation
further	 serves	 to  stimulate a  feeling  of  common  joint
interest  of  the management and workmen in  the  industrial
progress  and increased productivity.  This approach on	 the
part of the industrial employer would reflect his harmonious
and  sympathetic  co-operation in improving the	 status	 and
dignity	 of the industrial employee in accordance  with	 the
egalitarian   and  progressive	trend  of   our	  industrial
jurisprudence which strives to treat the capital and  labour
as  co-sharers	and  to break away  from  the  tradition  of
labour's subservience to capital.
</p><p id="p_34">Shri  Pai referred us to the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_31">Factories Act</a>, 63 of  1948	 and
submitted that<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_32"> s. 52</a> read with<a href="/doc/1275963/" id="a_33"> s. 2(f)</a> of that Act indicates
that  adult  workers  are not required to  work	 on  Sundays
except under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">606</span>
certain conditions.  It was argued that when Sundays as rest
days  are  considered  of importance, the law  in  terms  so
provides.  In the present case, according to the submission,
no  importance	is  intended to be attached  to	 Sundays  as
weekly	days of rest.  A change from Sundays to	 some  other
week  days as days of rest should be considered as a  matter
of  little or no importance for the workmen.  We are  unable
to  agree  with	 this  submission.   In,  our  opinion,	 the
<a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_34">Factories  Act</a> fortifies our view by suggesting that  it  is
not  immaterial or unimportant whether workmen are  given  a
Sunday or some other week day as a weekly rest day.   Though
reference was also made by Shri Pai to the <a href="/doc/1814464/" id="a_35">Mines Act</a>, 35  of
1952,  in  our opinion, each statutory provision has  to  be
construed on its own language, though the general scheme  of
legislation on a given subject may, if necessary, be kept in
view,  if it throws helpful light on the construction to  be
placed	on  an ambiguous provision.  No	 such  consideration
arises in the present case.
</p><p id="p_35">In  our opinion, in order to effectively achieve the  object
underlying <a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_36"> s. 9A</a>, it would be more appropriate to place  on
the  Fourth Schedule read with<a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_37"> S. 9A</a> a construction  liberal
enough-to include change of weekly rest days from Sunday  to
some  other week day.  The appellant having thus effected  a
change in the weekly days of rest without complying with <a href="/doc/620295/" id="a_38"> S.
9A</a> read with the Fourth Schedule this change must be held to
be  ineffective and the previous schedule of weekly days  of
rest must be held to be still operative.  Reference was made
at  the	 bar  to certain decisions but they  are  of  little
assistance in construing the statutory provisions with which
we are concerned and which, as already observed, have to  be
construed on their own language and scheme.  We,  therefore,
do not consider it necessary to refer to those decisions.
The result then is that the appellant's contention that	 the
workmen	  concerned  had  resorted  to	illegal	 strike	  on
September  22 and 29, 1963 must be rejected.  On  this	view
the respondents' contention that the appellant had illegally
declined to give work to the respondents on September 25 and
26,  1963  and that the appellant had declared	lock-out  on
those two days which was illegal has also to be upheld.	  No
doubt,	mere refusal to give work does not by itself  amount
to  lock-out but in the present case it cannot	be  disputed
that  when  the	 employers closed the  Sijua  and  Bhelatand
collieries  respectively on September 25 and 26,  1963	they
knew  that this change in the weekly days of rest  was,	 not
acceptable to a considerable section of the workmen who	 had
not come to work on Sunday September 22, 1963.	The  closure
of the place of work in the two aforesaid collieries on the
