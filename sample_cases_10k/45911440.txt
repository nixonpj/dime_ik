that the car was purchased on 10.08.1998 and the loan was

before the bank that due to defects in the car she has changed

defendant no.3 is concerned, it is submitted that the defendant

no.2 offered the security which was accepted by the bank

against the said loan when the bank was not satisfied with the

hypothecation of the car only. It is further submitted that the

said property was already mortgaged to the bank in one other

loan case and the defendant offered the same property quoting

the high value of the security.

defendants have admitted the claim of the plaintiff and wants

to settle the claim under RBI OTS Scheme. Hence, plaintiff is

the bank which is also an admitted fact and hence the bank is

<p id="p_46">            I have seen the pleadings and documents on record

the following grounds:
</p>
<p id="p_47">

</p><p id="p_48">            Firstly, defendants no.1 to 3 have taken a common

ground in their Preliminary Objections that the present suit filed

by the plaintiff bank u/o. 34 CPC is not maintainable as

defendant has not mortgaged any property.



</p><p id="p_49">            Secondly, defendants have not led any evidence to

prove this fact. In the arguments also, it is not stated as to how

the present suit is not maintainable u/o. 34 CPC. No ground

has been stated by the defendants as to how the suit filed by

the plaintiff u/o. 34 CPC is not maintainable.

</p><p id="p_50">            In the absence of evidence and arguments, I

feel that the defendants have failed to discharge the onus.

Accordingly the issue no.4 is decided against the

defendants and it is held that defendants have failed to

prove that the present suit filed u/o.34 CPC is not

maintainable as the defendant has not mortgaged any

property.

           These issues are again OPD i.e. the onus to prove

</p>
<p id="p_55">           I have seen the pleadings and documents on record

and feel that defendants have failed to prove issues no.5

and 6 on the following grounds:
</p>
<p id="p_56">

</p><p id="p_57">           Firstly, defendants have not led any evidence nor

advanced any arguments as to how plaintiff has forged the

documents and used the same. It is stated in the W.S. that

some of the documents does not contain the signatures of

defendant no.1 rather defendant no.3. This does not show that

plaintiff has committed any forgery. Forgery if any, may be

committed by defendant no.3.
</p>
<p id="p_58">

</p><p id="p_59">           Secondly, it is further alleged that plaintiff bank has

taken signatures on the blank papers. Anyhow the signatures

are admitted and documents on record filed by the plaintiff

bank are duly filled up. It is an admitted fact that loan was

taken. It is further an admitted fact that for securing the loan

defendant has signed the documents. There is no evidence on

record to show that defendant has signed on blank papers.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                             15/28</span>
</p><p id="p_60">                               //16//


Anyhow this ground cannot be taken in view of <a href="/doc/205529/" id="a_2">Section 91</a> and

<a href="/doc/1790262/" id="a_3">92</a> of Indian Evidence Act. Taking signatures on blank papers

does not prove the forgery even, if it is proved.



</p><p id="p_61">           Thirdly, all the defendants in their separate W.S.

has taken a similar objection on similar ground. The fact has

not been proved by evidence nor by oral arguments and

written submissions.
</p>
<p id="p_62">           In view of above, defendants have failed to

prove that plaintiff bank has forged the documents and

used the same. Accordingly issues no.5 and 6 are decided

against the defendants and in favour of plaintiff bank.

           Firstly, defendants have not led any evidence to

prove this issue nor advanced any oral arguments or written

arguments in support of this.
</p>
<p id="p_69">

</p><p id="p_70">           Secondly, documents on record shows that

defendant has taken loan for purchase of the car. The car

bearing no. DL 4CJ 0303, Chasis No. 11943 Model 1998 was

hypothecated to the plaintiff bank vide hypothecation of the

goods to secure demand cash credit. Initial insurance was

done and original documents are with the plaintiff bank. The

R.C. of the car which is an admitted document, also shows

that the car is hypothecated to the Punjab &amp; Sind Bank i.e

plaintiff bank. If the loan was not taken for the purchase of the

car then how this hypothecation clause appears on the R.C. of

the car and the defendants have not challenged the

hypothecation clause in the plaintiff bank till to date.

</p><p id="p_71">           In view of above, I feel that defendants have

failed to prove that defendants have not taken any loan for

the purchase of the car. Accordingly issue no.7 is decided

against the defendants and in favour of plaintiff bank.

<p id="p_75">          I have seen the pleadings and documents on record

defendants on the following grounds:




</p><p id="p_76">          Firstly, issue no.8 was framed on a specific

objection taken by the defendant no.1 only in the W.S.

Defendants no.2 and 3 have not taken this objection in their

objection was taken.

dt.28.05.2001 is written by Sh.G.P.S.Rana i.e. defendant no.2.

This letter is not denied by the defendant. This letter shows

                               //19//


that defendant no.2 has signed papers at the time of the

disbursing of the loan. This letter is an admission by defendant

no.2 that he has signed as Guarantor of the loan amount.

</p><p id="p_79">           The second letter dt.17.06.2001 is purported to

have been written by Amrit Kaur, defendant no.1. However,

this letter appears to have been signed by Sh.G.P.S. Rana,

defendant no.2 as both letters are signed by the same person.

The letter dt.17.06.2006 shows that defendant no.2 is the

same person and writing on behalf of defendant no.1 while the

letter dt.17.06.2006 is alleged to be written by Amrit Kaur but it

is signed by defendant no.2. This shows defendant no.2

impersonating defendant no.1.

Hypothecation Agreement, Guarantee papers which are duly

signed by defendants no.2 and 3. Letter dt.28.05.2001 on

record shows that defendant no.2 has signed the Guarantee

papers. The documents are printed papers, cannot be blamed

later on typed.

<p id="p_82">           In view of above, I feel that defendants have

failed to prove the issues. Accordingly issues no.8 and 9

plaintiff's evidence was filed &amp; tendered also. On subsequent

dates, when the case was fixed for cross examination, witness

Mr.R.S.Wadhwa remained absent. Accordingly the affidavit of

           Secondly, for the case to recover u/o. 34 CPC the

original documents should be placed on record and should be

proved. The original documents have not been placed on

record by the plaintiff. Since there is no plaintiff evidence, the

original documents or the documents making the case u/o.34

CPC has not been proved.
</p>
<p id="p_89">           In view of above, I feel that plaintiff has failed to

discharge the onus. Accordingly issue no.2 is decided

and the interest being exorbitant and the taking the signatures

by plaintiff bank on the blank papers. Signatures on documents

no.1 agreed and was ready to pay the amount as per RBI OTS
