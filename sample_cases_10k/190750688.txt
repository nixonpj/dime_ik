 In the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan
Jaipur Bench, Jaipur
O R D E R
D.B. Civil Special Appeal (Writ) No.601/05
In S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.6053/2003
Balbir Singh Vs. State of Raj. &amp; Ors.

Date :: 04.04.2013

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ajay Rastogi
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Veerendr Singh Siradhana

Mr. C.L. Saini for appellant.
Mr. Kanishk Gupta on behalf of
Mr. Sushil Sharma, AAG, for respondent-State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">	Instant intra court appeal is directed against order of learned Single Judge dt.23.05.2005 dismissing the writ petition at admission stage on the premise that selection was for the vacancy of 2003-04 initiated pursuant to advertisement dt.28.07.2003 and appointments must have been finalized by now in district Alwar and no relief on account of changed circumstances could be granted to the writ petitioner. 
</p><p id="p_2">	It appears that certain salient facts necessary to examine the controversy raised by the appellant since remained unnoticed by the learned Single Judge and being a non-speaking order in our opinion is not legally sustainable and the option with us is either to remit the matter back to the learned Single Judge to examine grievance of the appellant afresh or to be examined by us but being a case where the appellant is trying hard to get justice from the court of law for sufficient long time almost for a decade for his legitimate grievance seeking appointment on the post of PTI Grade-III, under these facts &amp; circumstances, with consent of the parties, we considered it appropriate to hear the parties on merits and dispose of the present appeal.
</p><p id="p_3">	The necessary facts culled out for examining the controversy raised herein are that district-wise vacancy of the post of PTI Grade-III for the year 2003-04 were notified from the office of Director, Secondary Education, Bikaner vide advertisement dt.28.07.2003 and as regards district Alwar for which the present appellant was one of the applicant, there were 49 vacancies advertised of PTI Grade-III (boys &amp; girls) and out of 49 vacancies 11 was reserved for OBC category, out of 11 there was further horizontal reservation; 10 reserved for male and 1 for female.
</p><p id="p_4">	The appellant being eligible &amp; member of OBC category participated in the selection process which the respondents initiated pursuant to advertisement dt.28.07.2003. However, it was notified in the advertisement that the provisional merit list district-wise shall be published by 18.08.2003 and objections were invited from the candidates if aggrieved as regards their merit indicated in the provisional merit list by 23.08.2003 and such of the candidates whose name finds place obviously in the final merit list will be called for interview on 03.09.2003 but there is nothing on record as to whether the provisional &amp; final merit list was at all published by the respondents as regards District Alwar. However, it was alleged by the appellant in the writ petition that interview letter dt.30.08.2003 with original envelope was dispatched from the office of District Education Officer, Alwar  on 01.09.2003 and was received by him on 04.09.2003 and the date of interview scheduled was 03.09.2003 and immediately after the interview letter being received on 04.09.2003 he served a notice for demand of justice through his counsel on 08.09.2003 which was sent by registered AD but as revealed to him the appointments were made by the respondents in district Alwar vide order dt.08.09.2003, under these facts and circumstances, he approached to this Court by filing writ petition on 07.10.2003. 
</p><p id="p_5">	However, in the reply filed by the respondent to the special appeal preferred by the appellant, the only averment made is that the appellant had secured 79.24% marks in OBC category and he was to be considered for appointment but since he failed to appear for interview as scheduled on 03.09.2003 could not be considered for appointment. However, this has not been averred by the respondent in the reply that whether the appellant was made aware of his placement in the merit list if provisional &amp; final list was published in terms of advertisement dt.28.07.2003 and if at all published where was the name of the appellant find place in the order of merit. However, this fact has also not been controverted as to whether interview letter which was dispatched from their office on 30.08.2003 was at all served before the date of interview scheduled to be held on 03.09.2003, at the same time there is specific averment made by the appellant in his writ petition that he secured 79.24% of marks which was admitted by the respondent and the candidate in OBC category who secured 77.38% marks in District Alwar was considered for appointment on the post of PTI Grade-III pursuant to the advertisement dt.28.07.2003.
</p><p id="p_6">	As regards the selection process, the merit of the incumbent was to be determined on the basis of his academic record and the interview was only for the purpose of examining his original academic records and such of them who appeared in interview and found suitable their names will find place in the order of merit for appointment. The relevant clause-11 &amp; 12 of the advertisement dt.28.07.2003 reads ad infra:

	The appellant has come before the Court with a specific case that he was higher in merit and secured 79.24% marks on the basis of academic record and the candidate who secured 77.38% in OBC category was considered for appointment and he was not informed that he has to appear for interview on 03.09.2003 being an eligible applicant and interview is only for the purpose of examining the original academic records/certificates of the incumbent, he could not have been deprived of his legitimate claim from being considered for appointment to the post of PTI Grade-III. 
</p><p id="p_10">	In response, the respondent has averred in their reply filed to the special appeal that the appellant admittedly secured 79.24% marks in OBC category but was not considered for appointment as he failed to appear for interview on 03.09.2003. However, no other defence has been averred by the respondent other than what is being referred to as indicated above.
</p><p id="p_11">	When the appellant could not be informed in time that he has to appear for interview on 03.09.2003 and the postal authorities being the agency of the respondent department, it was their duty to see that the applicants must be made known that they have to appear for interview on 03.09.2003. Admittedly in the instant case, the interview letter was served upon him on 04.09.2003 and on 08.09.2003 he served a legal notice at the same time appointments were also made by 08.09.2003 in OBC category for the post of PTI Grade-III pursuant to advertisement dt.28.07.2003, under these facts &amp; circumstances, indisputably the right of fair consideration of the appellant has been seriously jeopardized and he could not be deprived from being considered for appointment.
</p><p id="p_12">	In our considered view, once the person as alleged by him being lower in merit in OBC category secured 77.38% marks has been considered for appointment on the post of PTI Grade-III the appellant who secured 79.24% of marks at least was entitled to be considered and there appears no justification to deny appointment to him who was otherwise eligible under the Rules of 1971 for appointment on the post of PTI Grade-III pursuant to advertisement dt.28.07.2003, more so when the reason forthcoming from the side of respondent is not supported by any evidence and even otherwise it was the duty of the department to take proper care intimating to the incumbents who are to be called for interview on the date fixed/notified for verification of their academic records on 03.09.2003.
</p><p id="p_13">	Consequently, the appeal succeeds &amp; is hereby allowed. The order of the learned Single Judge dt.23.05.2005 is hereby quashed &amp; set aside and if any incumbent lower in merit than the appellant was considered for appointment on the post of PTI Grade-III in district Alwar pursuant to advertisement dt.28.07.2003, the respondents are directed to consider candidature of the appellant for appointment to the post of PTI Grade-III. However, he will be entitled for notional benefits including fixation of pay &amp; seniority as per his order of merit but will not be entitled for the actual salary &amp; allowances of the intervening period during which he had not worked. Appropriate orders be passed within one month. No cost.
