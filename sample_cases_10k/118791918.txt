      filed by the police.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2) Complete   set   of   copies   was   supplied   to   the   accused   and   after   hearing 

     arguments, vide order dated 17.12.07 charge for offence punishable u/s 61

</p><p id="p_3">3) Prosecution   in   support   of   present   case   examined   the   following   seven 

     witnesses.      
</p>
<p id="p_4">                   HC Neearaj appeared as PW­1 who deposed that on 13.11.2004, he

     accused   Bijender   @   Bhatia   coming   from   the   side   of   Shahdara   Railway 

     Station having a 10 litres plastic can in his right hand.  On suspicion, he was 

     chased and stopped and can was checked and smell of liquor was coming 

     from the can.  In the meantime, IO SI Randhir Singh reached at the spot and 

     the accused along with the recovered can was handed over to the IO.   IO 

     took out one quarter bottle liquor as sample from can and can and sample 

     was sealed with the seal of RS and form M­29 was filled and after use the

      Ex.P1.   PW­1 correctly  identified the accused.   In his cross examination, 

     PW­1 stated  that IO called some passers by to join the investigation, but 

     none agreed and no notice was served to them. PW­1 denied the suggestion 

     that nothing was recovered from the possession of the accused and he never 

     produced the accused along with the alleged case property to the IO. 

</p><p id="p_5">                   DO Retired SI Inder Pal appeared as PW­2 who proved the present 

     FIR, Ex.PW­2/A and endorsement on the rukka Ex.PW­2/B.   

</p><p id="p_6">                            IO SI Randhir Singh appeared as PW­3 who deposed that on 

     13.11.2004,   he   was   on   patrolling  duty  and  at   about  08:40  PM,   when  he 

     reached near shop of Dr. Pal, Janta Colony, Shahdara,   Ct. Neeraj and Ct. 

     Sukhbir met him and they handed over the accused along with the recovered 

     can to PW­3.  PW­3 requested some public persons to join the proceedings, 

     but none agreed.   PW­3 recorded the statement of Ct. Neeraj, Ex.PW­1/B. 

     Thereafter, PW­3 measured the liquor which came to be 13 bottles.  He took 

     out one quarter bottle liquor as sample from can and can and sample was 

     sealed with the seal of RS and form M­29 was filled and after use the seal 

     was handed over to Ct. Neeraj.  PW­3 proved the seizure memo Ex.PW­1/A, 

     the   rukka   Ex.PW­3/A,   site   plan   Ex.PW­3/B,   arrest   memo   Ex.PW­3/C, 

     personal search memo Ex.PW­3/D and also identified the case property i.e.

      the can Ex.P1.   In his cross examination, PW­3 admitted that the spot is a 

     residential  area.   PW­3 denied the suggestion that the accused was called 

     from his house and the accused was falsely implicated in the present case 

     and nothing was recovered from the possession of the accused. 

</p><p id="p_7">                 HC Amrish appeared as PW­4 who deposed that on 02.01.2005, the 

     investigation of the present case was handed over to him and on receiving 

     the result, he prepared the challan and filed before the court. 

</p><p id="p_8">                  Ct. Anil appeared as PW­5 who deposed that on 19.11.04, he took 

     the sample sealed with the seal of RS from Malkhana PS Vivek Vihar vide 

     RC No.252/21 to deposit the same in Excise Lab and receipt of the same was 

     handed over to the MHC(M).  
</p>
<p id="p_9">                              MHC(M) HC Jagpal Singh appeared as PW­6 who proved the 

     relevant entry in register no.19 at serial no.2890, Ex.PW­6/A, regarding the 

     submission of one plastic can and one sample quarter bottle by SI Randhir. 

     On 19.11.04, the sample quarter bottle was sent to Excise Lab through Ct. 

     Anil  vide   RC   No.252/21   and   on   31.01.2005,   the   result   of   the   same   was 

     obtained by him.     
</p>
<p id="p_10">                        Ct. Sukhbir appeared as PW­7 who deposed on the same lines as 

     PW­1.  
</p>
<p id="p_11">FIR No. 466/04,    PS: Vivek Vihar                   State Vs. Bijender @ Bhatia                                Page No... 4/7 
</p><p id="p_12"> 4) Statement of accused was recorded wherein he pleaded innocence and false 

     implication in this case, however, he did not wish to examine any witness in 

     support of his defence. 
</p>
<p id="p_13">5) I   have   heard   the   Ld.   APP   for   State   and   Ld.   Defence   Counsel   and   have 

     perused the record.
</p>
<p id="p_14">6) To prove the charge U/S 61 Punjab Excise Act, the prosecution has to prove 

     that the accused was found in possession of a plastic can containing 9.750 litres 

     of  illicit liquor, without any  valid  permit  or  license.   First of all, no  public 

     witness   has   been   joined   by   the   IO   in   the   present   case   despite   availability. 

     Admittedly, several public witnesses were present at the time of apprehension 

     of the accused and while completion of formalities at the spot but none of the 

     public witness has been joined in the investigation. The explanation given by 

     the prosecution in this regard is that the public persons had refused to join the 

     investigation.  In  Roop Chand Vs. State of Haryana, 1990(1) CLR 69, it has  

     been observed that such explanations that the public persons refused to join  

     the   proceedings   are   unreliable   and   in   Pardeep   Narayan   Vs.   State   of  

     Maharashtra, AIR 1995 SC 1930, it has been held that failure of police to  

     join witness from locality during search creates doubt about fairness of the  

     investigation, benefit of which has to go to the accused.  

FIR No. 466/04,    PS: Vivek Vihar                   State Vs. Bijender @ Bhatia                                Page No... 5/7 
</p><p id="p_15"> 7) It is a settled proposition of law that Sub­section 4 to Sec. 100 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>. is a 

     directory provision however, the explanation of non­joining of independent 

     witness   should   also   be   plausible.   The   explanation   put   forth   by   the 

     prosecution   for   non­joining   of   independent   witness   appears   to   be 

     implausible   for   the   reason   that   no   notice   whatsoever,   was   given   to   the 

     persons refusing to join the investigation.  The same creates doubt regarding 

     the fairness of the investigation.
</p>
<p id="p_16">8) It  is also  noteworthy  that  most  crucial  part  of  the  investigation  has  been 

     conducted even prior to the registration of present FIR.  PW­3 has deposed 

     that he took out one quarter bottle liquor from can as sample and the sample 

     was sealed with the seal of RS and prepared the seizure memo Ex.PW­1/A. 

     IO prepared the rukka which he handed over to PW­1 HC Neeraj for the 

     registration of the case.  The record reveals that FIR number finds mention 

     on   the   seizure   memo   Ex.PW­1/A.   Admittedly,   the   Seizure   memo   was 

     prepared before registration of FIR.   When documents are prepared before 

     registration of FIR and it contain the FIR number, the inference has to be 

     drawn either FIR was recorded prior in time or the documents were prepared 

     later on and in such case, benefit of doubt has to be given to the accused.

</p><p id="p_17">9) Further, no efforts whatsoever have been made by the prosecution to collect 

FIR No. 466/04,    PS: Vivek Vihar                   State Vs. Bijender @ Bhatia                                Page No... 6/7 
      any clue about the source from where illicit liquor was arranged for by the 

     accused.   At   least,   some   efforts   must   have   been   made   by   the   police   to 

     interrogate the accused and conduct the requisite investigation to know as to 

     from where the accused arranged the illicit liquor.  
</p>
<p id="p_18">10)It is also worth mentioning that as per the case of the prosecution PW­1, 

     PW­3 and PW­7 were on patrolling duty at the time of incident. However, 

     no DD entry in support of this fact has been placed on record. This further 

     raises doubts about the prosecution story.
</p>
<p id="p_19">11) In view of the foregoing reasons, I am of the opinion that the prosecution 

     has failed to prove its case against the accused, beyond reasonable doubt. 

     Accordingly,   I   acquit   the   accused   Bijender   @   Bhatia   for   the   offence 

     punishable U/S 61 Punjab Excise Act in FIR No.466/04 PS Vivek Vihar. 

     Case property be confiscated to the State, as per rules.  Bail Bond of accused 

     shall remain in force and surety of the accused shall not be discharged for a 

     period of six months in view of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">section 437A</a> Cr.P.C.
