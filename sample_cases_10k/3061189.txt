Coram: Hon'ble K.M. Joseph, C.J.
      Hon'ble Sharad Kumar Sharma, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">K.M. Joseph, C.J. (Oral)
             Petitioner    challenges     Annexure-1       order    dated
30.05.2018 insofar as it relates to the petitioner and respondent
No. 4. By the impugned order, petitioner, who was working as a
Divisional Forest Officer/Deputy Conservator of Forest, Almora
Forest Division, Almora has been attached/transferred on
administrative ground to the office of the Principal Chief
Conservator of Forest, Uttarakhand. The only ground, which is
pressed before us by learned senior advocate for the petitioner, is
that the impugned order is in violation of the Indian Forest
Service (Cadre) Amendment Rules, 2014. Insofar as the tenure
of a cadre officer in a cadre post has been interfered without
following the procedure laid down in the said Rules. Expatiating
he would draw our attention to Rule 7(3) of the Indian Forest
Cadre Rules, 1966, which after the amendment in the year 2014,
reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "(3) A cadre officer, appointed to any cadre post
             shall hold office for at least two years unless in the
             meantime he or she has been promoted, retired or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 2</span>




           sent on deputation outside the State or training
           exceeding two months."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_2">2.         Thereafter, he drew our attention to the Schedule
made under Rule 7(1) and (5). Rule 3 is relevant, which reads as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           "3. Procedure.--(a) The Civil Services Board shall
           seek detailed justification from the Administrative
           Department of the concerned State Government for
           the transfer of an officer before the specified tenure.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">           (b) The Civil Services Board shall--
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">           (i) consider the report of the Administrative
           Department along with any other inputs it may have
           from other reliable sources;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">           (ii) not make recommendation for premature
           transfer of Cadre Officers unless it has been satisfied
           itself of the reasons for such premature transfer.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">           (c) The Civil Services Board shall submit a
           quarterly report in such Form as it thinks fit to the
           Central Government clearly stating the details of
           officers recommended to be transferred before the
           minimum specified tenure and the reasons therefor:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                  Provided that the Competent Authority may
           reject the recommendation of the Civil Services
           Board for the reasons to be recorded in writing."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">3.         Mr. B.D. Upadhyaya, learned Senior Counsel for the
petitioner would submit that impugned order, in other words, has
been passed without the Civil Services Board having acted in the
terms of procedure set out by Rules.
</p><p id="p_4">4.         The case as set up, on the other hand, by the official
respondents is that there were number of complaints against the
petitioner and he was, therefore, transferred on administrative
ground and he has been attached in the office of the Principal
Chief Conservator of Forest, Uttarakhand.
</p><p id="p_5">5.         Mr. Rakesh Thapliyal, learned counsel for the party
respondent would submit that the petitioner had voluntarily gave
up the charge and the 4th respondent in compliance of impugned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>




order has joined at the place of the petitioner at Almora. He
would also reiterate that the petitioner was transferred on the
basis of number of complaints against him and, therefore, Court
may not interfere, and even if the Court is inclined to interfere on
the ground urged by the petitioner, the 4th respondent may be
permitted to continue at the place, where he has joined and he
further stated that the transfer of the 4th respondent was a routine
transfer.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.          There is no dispute that the petitioner was posted in
November, 2017 at Almora. Rule 7(3) of the Cadre Rules, as set
out by us earlier, contemplates that cadre officer appointed in
cadre office shall hold the office for at least for two years. The
only exceptional situations, where it can be interfered, are: if he
has been promoted, retired or sent on deputation outside the State
or training exceeding two months. None of these situations are
prevailing in the instant case. The further exceptional
circumstances, in which the tenure of the cadre officer can be cut
short is when a transfer is necessitated prior to expiry of
guaranteed period of two years. For that, the procedure is given
in detail in Rule 3 of the Schedule prepared under Rule 7(1) and
(5). Therein, the Civil Service Board has to seek detailed
justification from the Administrative Department of the
concerned State Government for transfer of an officer.          The
Board is obliged to consider the report of the Administrative
Department along with any other inputs it may have been
provided from other reliable sources.         Secondly, and more
importantly, it is also obliged to obtain the comments or views of
the officer proposed to be transferred i.e. the petitioner in the
instant case, based on the circumstances presented to it in
justification of the proposal. Further the rule contemplates unless
the Board is satisfied of the reason for premature transfer, it shall
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4</span>




not make any recommendation for premature transfer of Cadre
Officers. The use of the negative language in sub clause 3(b)(iii)
of the Schedule makes it abundantly clear that it is mandatory
and it is necessarily required to be followed. No doubt, it is also
clear that the competent Authority can reject the recommendation
of the Civil Services Board for the reasons to be recorded in
writing.
</p><p id="p_7">7.            There is no dispute by any of the parties, that the
procedure as contemplated under Rules of 1966 read with
amendment of 2014, has not been followed. In fact, Mr. Pradeep
Joshi, learned Standing Counsel would submit that already steps
are afoot to take action in terms of the Rules in regard to the
petitioner.
</p><p id="p_8">8.            We are unable to accept the case of the respondents
that being an administrative transfer, the petitioner can be
transferred before expiry of the guaranteed period under Rule
7(3). Rule 7(3) appears to be peremptory in nature since relates to
cadre employee. The Rules in itself are comprehensive and it
does not admit of any exception, even if the exception is sought
to be projected in the form of complaints against the officer, as
the basis of existence of administrative ground.
</p><p id="p_9">9.            To a query posed to the learned Standing Counsel as
to whether there is any provision in the Rules, which contemplate
departure from the procedure in the Rules in the case of existence
of administrative ground, the learned Standing Counsel would
submit that there is no provision as such in the Rules, which
permits the Authorities to pass an administrative order of transfer
in respect of the cadre officer appointed to a cadre post departing
from the procedure, which is contemplated in the Schedule.
</p><p id="p_10">10.           In such circumstances, we are inclined to agree with
the learned senior counsel for the petitioner that the order of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    5</span>




transfer/attachment is in contravention of the law applicable. The
law applicable is contained in the statutory provision. Therefore,
one of the two exceptional circumstances, in which a transfer
order can be interfered with, namely, violation of statute is
present in this case. In such circumstances, we are inclined to
allow the writ petition.
</p><p id="p_11">11.          The argument of Mr. Rakesh Thapliyal, learned
counsel that as far as the 4th respondent is concerned, it is only a
routine transfer and he may not be disturbed cannot be accepted.
The impugned order shows that as far as the 4th respondent is
concerned, his transfer is in the vacant post which was held by
the petitioner prior to passing of impugned order. Therefore, the
transfer of the respondent, even if it is a routine transfer, it is only
in respect of the post created by the illegal transfer of the
petitioner. Therefore, the moment illegality is found and it is set
aside by courts, the consequence must follow. It may be that the
petitioner has been transferred on the basis of complaints, but as
we have already noticed that there is a procedure for processing
the complaint under the statutory Rules and that cannot be
bypassed, we are not inclined to accept it.
</p><p id="p_12">12.          Consequently, the writ petition is allowed. The
impugned order is quashed. We also, however, make it clear that
this judgment will not stand in the way of the Authorities, if
advised, proceeding in terms of the Rules afresh, which provide
for transfer, which we have already detailed in our judgment. No
order as to costs.</p><pre id="pre_2">
