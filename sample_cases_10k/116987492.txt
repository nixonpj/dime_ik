                       SUNIL THOMAS, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">                     =================
               B.A.Nos.3374 and 3424 of 2017
                     =================
                Dated this the 3rd day of August, 2017

                       COMMON ORDER

            These applications for bail are filed by the first and

second accused, respectively in Crime No.121 of 2017 of

Valancherry Police Station for offence punishable under section 420

r/w 34<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1"> of the Indian Penal Code</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.    The allegation of the de facto complainant, as is

discernible from the private complaint and the records available is

that, the first accused had entered into an agreement for sale with

the de facto complainant undertaking to assign the property that

stood in the name of the mother of the second accused and that of

his sister for a total consideration. A sum of Rs.34,00,000/- was

paid in the meanwhile.     Even though, de facto complainant was

ready and willing to perform his part of the contract, petitioner

dodged the assignment under various pretexts.        Only when the

conduct of the petitioner became suspicious, de facto complainant

verified and found that the accused had committed cheating. Since

the amount was not repaid, compliant was laid.        Apprehending

arrest, petitioner seeks bail.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.    The contention of the learned counsel for the first

accused is that he has not suppressed any material fact, that the

B.A.3374 &amp; 3424/17
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2</span>


very fact that he had only entered into an agreement to assign the

property, that was agreed to be sold by the original owners was

disclosed to the complainant. It was also contended that he was

ever ready and willing to perform his part of the contract and also

that, the allegation against the accused had got a flavour of civil

dispute also.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         4.       It appears that neither the first accused nor the second

accused have any title over the property at present.                  Property

originally stood in the name of the mother of the second accused as

well as the sister. On the basis of an undertaking to sell, a huge

amount of Rs.34,00,000/- was received by them. That has not been

repaid by them.            Having considered the nature of allegations,

though there are ingredients of civil nature also, the question

whether petitioner herein had a genuine intention to cheat, even at

the time of entering into the agreement, is a matter which has to be

established in the criminal proceeding. Having considered these

facts, this is not a fit case for granting the benefit of pre-arrest bail.
