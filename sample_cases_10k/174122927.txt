THIS WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
02.04.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
 WP(C).No. 6473 of 2019

                                      2

                                 JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Petitioners are granted with the facility of Rs.732 lakhs as term

loan for establishing an industrial unit for the petitioners in the land

having an extent of 207.55 cents situated at Kodur Village in

Perinthalmanna. The case of the petitioners is that, the building was

constructed and while the business was being carryied on, petitioners

have met with various financial constraints, due to unforeseen

circumstances. Fact remains, one of the petitioners was before this

Court     by    filing   W.P.(C)No.3755/2018   and   has   secured   Ext.P4

judgment, whereby the coercive action was directed to be put on hold

on the petitioner paying an amount of Rs.50 lakhs, either in bulk or in

instalments, however, within a period of one month.

</p><p id="p_2">     2.        I am informed that the said amount was paid, but not

within the time period fixed by this Court. It is also pointed out by the

learned Standing Counsel for the Corporation that, the interest

accrued was later converted as a term loan and the petitioners were

given sufficient instalments to pay off the interest amounts. Now

petitioners have failed to pay the interest, which was converted as

term loan and the interest against the principal amount has accrued

and altogether petitioners are liable to pay an amount of Rs.1.14

Crores. Learned Standing Counsel also pointed out that petitioners

are provided with a moratorium for a period of one year on and with
 WP(C).No. 6473 of 2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   3</span>

effect from 1.4.2019 also, on principal amount.

</p><p id="p_3">     3.    Respondents have filed a statement in terms of the

submissions made above. A reply affidavit is also filed by the

petitioners reiterating the stand adopted in the writ petition and also

pointing out that since instalment facility is provided to the petitioner

to pay the term loan on account of the interest, the claim now raised

by the respondents cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     4.    I have considered the rival submissions made across the

Bar and assimilated the factual and legal situations.

</p><p id="p_5">     5.    One thing is clear, the amounts due from the petitioners

are not disputed by the petitioners. As of now, as pointed out earlier,

1.14 Crores is due from the petitioners. Therefore, in the interest of

justice and bearing in mind that public money is involved and the

scheme of the Financial Corporation is working out on the basis of

repayment done, it is only fair and proper that the petitioners are

directed to pay an amount of Rs.50 lakhs within a time frame.

Therefore, there will be a direction accordingly to the petitioners to

pay an amount of Rs.50 lakhs within a month from the date of receipt

of a copy of this judgment. If the     petitioners are paying the said

amount, a representation shall be received from the petitioners,

which shall be considered for the purpose of granting instalments to

the petitioners, if it is found to be genuine and bonafide, for the
 WP(C).No. 6473 of 2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    4</span>

payment of the balance interest amount specified above, and a

decision shall be taken at the earliest possible and at any rate within

a month from the date of receipt of the representation. I make it clear

that if the petitioners are not complying with any of the directions

contained above, the respondents will be at liberty to proceed, in

consequence to the notice issued under <a href="/doc/922514/" id="a_1">Section 29</a> of the State

Financial Corporation Act. I also make it clear that, if the petitioner is

complying with the directions and making the payment as directed

above, the unit shall be handed over to the petitioner, without any

delay.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
