arguments at length on application under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_12">Section 156(3)</a>

Cr.P.C. and after considering the contents of the complaint

and report of IO, was of the opinion that matter requires

detailed field investigation and the same cannot be proved

</p><p id="p_7">4.     Vide order dated 02.05.2011 of this Court, protection

was granted to petitioner on arrest.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.     Ld. counsel for the petitioner submits that in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl.M.C.2488/2011                                Page 2 of 22</span>
 original complaint dated 17.05.2010, the only allegation

against the petitioner was that pursuant to agreement dated

17.03.2008 the petitioner has not shown the original papers

of   property    B-4,   Nizamuddin   (West),   New   Delhi   and

afterwards the complainant came to know that the property

has been mortgaged to a bank against overdraft facility

which the petitioner had intentionally hidden from him.

Otherwise also, the agreement dated 17.03.2008 itself

mentions that the property is free from all encumbrances

except Bank Over Draft facility which shall be cleared before

the date of registration or final payment whichever is later.


</p><p id="p_10">6.    Ld. counsel for the petitioner further submits that even

during the police enquiry as mentioned in the Action taken

report, the complainant Mehar Elahi has stated to the police

that in second agreement it was made clear that on property

B-4, Nizamuddin (West), New Delhi there is a bank over draft

facility.   It is further mentioned that Mehar Elahi could not

make the final payment by the due date as the buyer of his

property has not made payment to him in time and also that

he could not get loan from the bank. It is further mentioned

that "as per version of Mehar Elahi that as the original
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl.M.C.2488/2011                        Page 3 of 22</span>
 documents of the said property were in the bank so it was

mutually decided that the original papers will be released

only then the property can be registered in our names." As

such the allegation of misrepresentation or non-disclosure of

complete facts or hiding facts from Mehar Elahi is absolutely

false and baseless.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">7.     Thereafter, the complaint has filed another complaint

with the police and complaint case before the court wherein

he changed the allegations completely and has admitted

that the bank over draft facility is mentioned in the

agreement dated 17.03.2008, however, the name of the

bank and other details were not disclosed.      This fact itself

shows that the complainant is desperate to wreck vengeance

upon the petitioner and is trying to make a criminal case out

of a purely civil transaction and breach of agreement. The

arbitration proceedings have already been initiated by the

complainant and petition under <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_18">Section 11</a> of Arbitration and

<a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_19">Conciliation Act</a> seeking appointment of an arbitrator is

pending before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">8.     It is further submitted by ld. counsel for the petitioner

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl.M.C.2488/2011                              Page 4 of 22</span>
 that the breach of agreement is also due to complainant‟s

own fault, as he had failed to make the payment within the

time frame.     This fact has also been noted by Hon‟ble Mr.

Justice Vipin Sanghi in his order dated 19.11.2010. In paras

16   to   20,   it   is   clearly   mentioned    that   it   was   the

petitioner/complainant alone who was responsible for the

breach of agreement. It has been further observed that the

telegram dated 26.08.2008 sent by the petitioner herein

clearly shows that respondent/Aman Ullah Khan (petitioner

herein)   was    insisting    upon    timely    compliance    of   the

agreement and was willing to complete the transaction.


</p><p id="p_15">9.   It is further submitted that the complaint made to the

police and the complaint case filed before the court do not

disclose commission of any offence whatsoever. There are

no allegation of forgery of any document as such no offence

under <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_20">Section 468</a>/<a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_21">471</a> Indian Penal Code, 1860 is made out.

Similarly the allegations regarding offence under <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_22">Section 506</a>

Indian Penal Code, 1860 are absolutely vague and bogus.

On the contrary it was the complainant who had been

threatening and defaming the petitioner and his family for

which a FIR was registered on 08.08.2010 against the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Crl.M.C.2488/2011                     Page 5 of 22</span>
 respondent/complainant Mehar Elahi and after investigation

into that FIR, charge-sheet has also been filed and same is

pending trial. Similarly, in the entire complaint there is no

allegation of criminal breach of trust or cheating punishable

under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_23">Section 406</a>/<a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_24">420</a> Indian Penal Code, 1860.


</p><p id="p_16">10.    Ld. counsel for the petitioner further submits that in the

instant case the breach of agreement has been committed

by the respondent/complainant himself by not adhering to

the schedule of payment and not making the final payment

by    31.08.2008      in   terms    of   agreement     to   sell   dated

17.03.2008. Because of the failure of the complainant, the

agreement dated 17.03.2008 stand terminated and the

petitioner     is   entitled   to   forfeit   the   advance    amount.

Petitioner had already issued notice dated 01.09.2008 to the

complainant in this regard.          However, how much damages

the petitioner has suffered due to the breach of agreement

by the complainant is subject matter of adjudication in the

arbitration proceedings in terms of para 21 of the order

dated 19.11.2010 passed by ld. Single Judge of this Court.


</p><p id="p_17">11.    Ld. counsel for the petitioner further submits that it is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Crl.M.C.2488/2011                                     Page 6 of 22</span>
 clear from the facts, that it was the respondent/complainant

himself who could not fulfil his part of the bargain by making

timely payment to the petitioner. It is to be noted that in the

year 2008 there was slump in the market and property

market has crashed as such the complainant did not do

anything for a period of about 02 years, and when the

property prices increased due to boom in the market, the

complainant         started   threatening   and   pressurizing    the

petitioner to return double the amount of money or in the

alternate sell the property at 2008 prices.


</p><p id="p_18">12.    Admittedly, the property at present is in the name of

possession of the petitioner and there is injunction against

the respondent/complainant, thereby restraining them from

interfering in the possession or trespassing upon the

property of the petitioner in any manner whatsoever.              The

agreement dated          17.03.2008, is a simple agreement,

whereby, the petitioner was to sell the property to the

respondent and handover the peaceful possession of the

property at the time of receiving the full payment and

registration of sale deed.

</p><p id="p_20"> 13.    Ld. counsel for the petitioner further submits that while

exercising its powers under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_25">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. the Court has

to see, whether, there is any misuse of process of law and

that the present complaint does not disclose commission of

any crime and at the best it is a civil dispute, for which

arbitration     proceedings   are   already   initiated   by    the

respondent himself.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">14.     Ld. counsel for the petitioner further submits that in

these circumstances, the petition may be allowed and the

complaint case titled as "Mehar Elahi &amp; Ors. Vs. Aman U.

Khan" pending in the court of ld. MM, Saket, New Delhi and

FIR No.112/2011 at PS Hazrat Nizamuddin may be quashed.


</p><p id="p_23">15.    On the other hand ld. counsel for the respondent

No.2/complainant submits that the investigation of the

aforesaid complaint is at initial stage, as the case itself was

registered only on 01.05.2011, on the orders of the

ld. Magistrate passed under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_26">section 156(3)</a> Cr.P.C. and there

is no occasion or ground for its quashing, as the allegations

contained in the FIR clearly spell out commission of an

offence of cheating to the tune of `3.35 crores, criminal

</p><p id="p_25">16.    Ld.   counsel     for     the   respondent   No.2/complainant

further submits that the present petition filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_32">Section

482</a> Cr.P.C. is not maintainable, in view of the law laid down

by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, followed by our own High

Court, wherein, it has been repeatedly held that the FIR has

to be taken on its face value and then it is to be examined as

to whether it spells out the commission of offences

complained of and that there is no question of considering

the merits of        the allegations contained in the FIR at that

stage or testing the veracity of the allegations contained in

the said FIR.

</p><p id="p_27">17.    Ld.   counsel     for     the   respondent   No.2/complainant

interfere     with    the      investigation   at   an     initial   stage,

relied upon case of „State of West Bengal and Ors. Vs.

Swapan Kumar Guha and Ors.‟ AIR 1992 Supreme Court

pg.949, wherein it was held that as under:-



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "If an offence is disclosed, the High Court under
      <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_34">Art.226</a> of the Constitution will not normally
      interfere with an investigation into the case and
      will permit investigation into the offence alleged
      to be completed; if, however, the materials do not
      disclose an offence, no investigation should
      normally be permitted.     Justice requires that a
      person who commits an offence has to be
      brought to book and must be punished for the
      same. If the Court interferes with the proper
      investigation in a case where an offence has been
      disclosed, the offence will go unpunished to the
      serious detriment of the welfare of the society
      and the cause of the justice suffers. It is on the
      basis of this principle that the Court normally
      does not interfere with the investigation of a case
      where an offence has been disclosed."

Jain &amp; Ors.‟ (1986) 3 SCC Pg.67, wherein it was held that as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       "The High Court erred in quashing the criminal
       proceedings under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_35">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. on an
       erroneous basis when on prima facie being
       satisfied the Metropolitan Magistrate had taken
       cognizance of the alleged offences. The question
       at this stage, is, not whether there was any truth
       in the allegations made but the question is
       whether on the basis of the allegations, a
       cognizable offence or offences had been alleged
       to have been committed. The facts subsequently
       found out to prove the truth or otherwise on the
       allegation is not a ground on the basis of which
       the complaint can be quashed.      Taking all the
       allegations in the complaint to be true, without
       adding or subtracting anything, at this stage, it
       can be said that a prima facie case for trial had
       been made out. That is the limit of the power to
       be exercised by the High Court under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_36">Section

Swamy Naidu &amp; Ors.‟ 2007 (3) SCR 348, wherein it was

held that as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       "It is settled law that an FIR and the consequent
       investigation cannot be quashed unless there is
       no offence spelt out from the same. The law in
       this respect is settled that the said FIR has to be
       taken on its face value and then it is to be
       examined as to whether it spells out the offences
       complained        of.     There     was        no    question    of
       considering        the     merits     of       the     allegations
       contained in the FIR at that stage or testing the
       veracity of allegations. In this case, admittedly,
       the investigation was in progress. The police had
       also not reported back to the Magistrate the
       result       of   their    investigation.            Under    such
       circumstances, the FIR could have been quashed
       only and only if there appeared to be no offence
       spelt out therein. A glance at the FIR suggests
       that there were serious allegations against both
       the    accused,         respondents        1    and     2    herein
       inasmuch as it was specifically alleged that in
       spite of the revocation of the General Power of
       Attorney and in spite of a specific notice to that
       effect by the complainant to the first respondent,
       the first respondent went on dishonestly to
       execute the sale deed in favour of his own

        daughter on the basis of the said revoked General
       Power of Attorney. It is alleged against the first
       respondent that he had no right over the property
       and yet he had executed a document in favour of
       the second respondent without any authority with
       an intention to cause loss to the complainant and
       to cheat him. It was alleged against the second
       respondent that she was well aware that the first
       respondent          was    not    competent       to    sell   the
       property       so    as    to    defraud    and    cheat       the
       complainant and, therefore, she also was liable to
       be punished under <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_37">Sections 464</a>, <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_38">423</a>, <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_39">420</a> read
       with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_40">Section 34</a> IPC. It was not for the learned
       Judge at the stage of investigation to examine the
       nature of the transaction and further to examine
       as    to      whether      any     offence      was      actually
       committed by the accused persons or not. At that
       stage the only inquiry which could have been
       made was as to whether the complaint or the FIR
       did contain allegations of any offence. Whether
       those offences were made out, even prima facie,
       could not have been examined at that stage as
       the     investigation        was    pending        then.       We,
       therefore, do not agree with the learned Single
       Judge that the FIR was liable to be quashed. We
       also do not agree with the learned Judge that

      into that question. Our prima facie examination
      satisfies   us   that   there   were   ingredients   of
      offences complained of and, therefore, at that

      where it was observed that the Court cannot be
      justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to the

      during investigation only while dealing with
      petitioner under <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_42">Section 482</a>. High Court cannot
      evaluate such evidence which is yet to be
      produced before the Trial Court. Quashing of the
      FIR by the High Court in such circumstances was
      deprecated by the Supreme Court. Similarly in
      the case of M/s Jayant Vitamins Ltd. V. Chaitanya

      that the investigation is the statutory function of
     police, superintendence of which vests with the
     State Government. The High Court, therefore, is
     not justified without compelling and justifiable
     reasons to interfere with the same. Supreme

     held that investigation into cognizable offence
     cannot be interfered with when no charge has
     been      laid.   To    the      same    effect      are    the
     observations of the Supreme Court in the case of
     Man Singh V. Delhi Admn. 1974 S.C. 1146. The
     question      was      posed     whether     the     inherent

investigation of the case could be quashed. The police is yet

to decide as to whether the accused/petitioner is liable to be

prosecuted or not, and in case the accused/petitioner is

finally charged and if he is aggrieved, he can always

the aggrieved complainant/respondent No.2. It is also clear

from the record that despite orders of this Court dated

19.11.2010, directing the accused to deposit in court a sum

of `3.35 crores within three months from the date of the

order i.e. by 18.02.2011, the said order has not been

complied with and it is for this reason that this Court vide

order dated 14.02.2011 granted injunction stay in favour of

the respondent and against the petitioner/accused, directing

him not to create any third party interest in the property in

question, which he had agreed to sell to the complainant for

a total sum of `5.05 crores.

to sell his property, bearing No.B-4, Nizamuddin West, New

Delhi (which he intended to develop, after clearing the bank

loan and demolishing the existing structure) for total sale

complainant to first deliver him a sum of ` 30 lakhs and

further to deliver him ` 2.75 crores more (total 3.35 crores)

his own use, being well aware of the fact that neither he is
