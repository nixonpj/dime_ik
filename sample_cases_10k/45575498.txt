         In   order   to   prove   its   case,   prosecution   has   examined   5   witnesses.   The

         stated that at about 2.30 PM,  two boys debodarded from a bus and the secret 

         informer pointed out towards said persons.  He further stated that when they 

         tried to apprehend said persons, they started running. He further stated that

         cross examination, PW1 stated that no written notice was given to the public 

         persons in his presence.   PW1 further stated that shops are situated at the 

         spot.  PW1 also stated that no written notice was given to the shopkeepers in

</p>
<p id="p_9">    (b) PW2 is HC Ashok Kumar.  The testimony of PW2 is similar to that of PW1 

         as both of them were on duty together.  PW2 deposed that the accused was 

         apprehended by PW1.  PW2 further deposed that other person was handed 

         over to him by the public persons from whom a knife was recovered.  PW2 

         further stated that knife was not recovered from the possession of accused in 

         his presence.   PW2 was cross examined   by Ld APP for the State.   In his

         Ld.   APP   for   the   State   had   argued   that   the   prosecution   has   successfully 

         proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.  Ld. APP for 

         the State had also argued that the factum of recovery of aforesaid knife from 

         the accused has been proved beyond reasonable doubt by the testimony of 

         PWs and therefore, accused is liable to be convicted in this case.

</p><p id="p_17">                             On   the   other  hand,   Ld.  defence   counsel   had   argued   that   the 

         testimony of PWs is full of contradictions and the contradictions have made 

         the testimony of PWs doubtful. Ld. defence counsel had also argued that 

         prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against the accused and 

         therefore, the accused is entitled of being acquitted in this case.

</p><p id="p_19">        REASONS FOR THE DECISION :­
                                   

</p><p id="p_20">    (i) As per the testimony of PW1 and PW5 the sketch of knife is Ex. PW1/B and 

           Ex. PW5/A.  The seizure memo of knife is Ex. PW1/C.  PW1 and PW5 have 

           stated in their testimony recorded in court that the aforesaid two documents 

           were prepared by IO prior to the registration of the present case. However, 

           perusal   of   abovesaid   documents   i.e.   Ex.   PW1/B   and   Ex.   PW1/C   clearly 

           shows that the FIR Number and other particulars of the present case are 

           mentioned   on   the   said   documents.     No   explanation   has   come   from   the 

           prosecution as to how the FIR Number surfaced on those documents which 

           were prepared prior to the registration of the case.  This fact casts a doubt 

           upon the testimony of PW1 and PW5 because if the said documents were 

           prepared   prior   to   the   registration   of   the   present   case,   then   how   the   FIR 

           Number as well as other particulars of the present case surfaced on the said 

           documents.   At this stage, reference can also be made of a case titled as 

           <a href="/doc/382540/" id="a_6">Pawan Kumar vs. Delhi Admn</a>. 1987 CC Cases­585 Delhi wherein Hon'ble 

           High Court of Delhi had held that the mention of FIR Number on recovery 

           memo etc. which were prepared prior to lodging the FIR creates doubt and 

           benefit should go to the accused. 
</p>
<p id="p_21">    (ii)                   It is important to note that the place from where the accused was 

           apprehended was a very busy place/ industrial area but inspite of it, IO of 

           the case failed to join public witnesses in the investigation of the case.  The 

           time of apprehension of the accused was 2.30 PM. PW1 and PW2 in their 

           examination in chief had stated that 4­5 public persons were requested to 

           join the raiding party but none agreed.  PW1 also stated in his examination 

           in chief that IO had also requested 4­5 persons to join the investigation but 

State Vs. Vinod Kr; FIR No. 93/2008; PS Anand Parbat                                                                                                                5/ 
          none   agreed   and   left   expressing   their   inability.     PW5   in   his   cross 

         examination had stated that no written notice was given to the persons who 

         refused to join the investigation.   It is a matter of record that no sincere 

         efforts were made by IO to  join the public witnesses in the investigation of 

         the present case and no notice was served upon the public persons who had 

         refused   to   join   the   investigation   as   requested   by   the   IO.  At   this   stage, 

         reference can also be made to a case titled as  <a href="/doc/924354/" id="a_7">Nanak Chand vs. State of  

         Delhi</a> reported as 1992 Cr.L.J­ 55 wherein it was held that the recovery was 

         from a street with  houses on both sides and shops nearby.   And, yet no 

         witness from the public has been produced.  Not that in every case the police 

         officials are to be treated as unworthy of reliance but their failure to join 

         witnesses from the public especially when they are available at their elbow, 

         may cast doubt.   
</p>
<p id="p_22">    (iii)                  It is also pertinent to mention that the prosecution has failed to 

         produce any documentary evidence or the DD entries regarding departure of 

         PW1 and PW2 from the police station. PW1 and PW2 have not even given 

         the DD Number vide which they had left the police station for bus checking 

         duty. This fact also creates a doubt in the prosecution version.  

</p><p id="p_23">    (iv)                   It is also pertinent to mention that as per testimony of PW1 and 

         PW5  seal after use was handed over by PW5 to PW1.  PW1 and PW5 are 

         police officials and were posted in the same police station  on the relevant 

         date and time. Seal was not handed over to any independent witness. In such 

         a situation the possibility of tampering with the case property cannot be 

         ruled out.

          Keeping   in   view   the   facts   and   circumstances   and   the   discussion   made 

         hereinabove, I am of considered view that prosecution has failed to prove its 

         case against accused beyond reasonable doubt.   Hence, accused is hereby 

         acquitted in present case.
