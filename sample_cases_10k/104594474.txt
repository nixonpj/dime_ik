              Dated this the 15th day of March, 2018

                                    JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     These writ petitions are related to a maintenance

claim by a senior citizen, namely, Smt.Rachel David. The

Maintenance Tribunal passed an order dated 02.07.2014

directing    the       daughters,              Smt.Saramma                   George   and

Smt.Alice David to pay maintenance. This order is under

challenge in W.P.(C) No.35130 of 2015.                                 It is to be noted

that the order was also challenged before the Appellate

Tribunal by Saramma George.                                  At the instance of

Saramma George, the Appellate Authority interfered the

order and remitted back the matter to the Tribunal.

</p><p id="p_2">     2.     In view of the above, the challenge made by

Alice David has become infructuous as the same order

was interfered by the Appellate Authority. After the

remand, the Tribunal passed an order directing the
W.P.(C) No.24344 &amp; 35130 of 2015   2




daughter-in-law of the Rachel David, namely, Smt.Valsa

Yesudas, the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.24344 of 2015 to pay

maintenance.         The case of the Valsa Yesudas is that she is

not liable to pay maintenance as the daughters are alive

and they are liable to pay maintenance. According to Valsa

Yesudas, she will not come within the ambit of relative as

defined under <a href="/doc/1106153/" id="a_1">Section 2(g)</a> of the Maintenance and Welfare

of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007.

</p><p id="p_3">      3.     The learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C)

No.24344 of 2015 fairly admitted that on the moral

obligation, the petitioner is prepared to pay Rs.1,500/- and

that cannot be construed as legal obligation to pay the

maintenance. That submission is recorded.

</p><p id="p_4">      4. In view of the facts and circumstances, these writ

petitions are disposed of as follows:
</p><p id="p_5">W.P.(C) No.24344 &amp; 35130 of 2015     3




      W.P.(C)No.35130 of 2015 is closed as infructuous in

view of the subsequent order passed by the Maintenance

Tribunal.       It is declared that the petitioner in W.P.(C)

No.24344 of 2015 is not legally obliged to pay maintenance

to Rachel David being the daughter-in-law. However, she

shall continue to pay Rs.1,500/- based on the submission

made before this Court under the moral obligation. Rachel

David is free to approach the Maintenance Tribunal to seek

maintenance against her children if so warranted in future.
