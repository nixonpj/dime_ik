                      seeking the relief of declaration declaring that the suit property is

                      the absolute property of the plaintiff, further for the relief of

                      mandatory injunction directing the defendants to remove the stone

                      pillars and construction made in the suit schedule property.      By

                      judgment and decree dated 29.10.1997, the learned District

                      Munsif, Devakottai, has held that the plaintiff has proved his title

                      over the suit property and thereby he has entitled the relief as

                      prayed and ultimately, granted the decree in favour of the plaintiff.

                      findings arrived at by the trial Court.   Feeling aggrieved over the

<p id="p_7">                                  The plaintiff is having an extent of 15 cents Nanja land in

                      S.F.No.71/22 of Thenneervayal Village, in which the suit schedule

                      property measuring an extent of 4 cents is the part and parcel of

                      the above 15 cents.      For the entire 15 cents, the patta has been

                      issued in favour of the plaintiff in Patta No.109. UDR patta has also

                      been issued to the plaintiff in Patta No.227.     The defendants are

                      having the property on the eastern side of the suit property in

                      Survey No.71/23. Originally, the said property is in the hands of

                      one Kalimuthu prior to the suit. By using the absence of plaintiff,

                      the said Kalimuthu encroached the suit property by putting the

                      wall.   Hence, after returning to the village, the plaintiff questioned

                      about the same. In response to the objection raised by the plaintiff,

                      the defendants removed the encroachment put up by him.            Now,

                      the defendants are attempted to interfere with the peaceful

                      possession of the plaintiff by digging the small bit on the eastern

                      side of the suit property owned by the plaintiff.       The second

                      defendant purchased the said property from one Kalimuththan

                      Ambalam vide sale deed dated 05.02.1970.         The said Kalimuthu

                      never constructed any wall in the suit schedule property. Before

                      the purchase, the said wall is in existence in the suit schedule

                      property. Since the compound wall situated in the property owned

                      by the defendants was in a dilapidated condition, the defendants

                      put up the stone pillar in his property.     Further, the defendants

                      constructed a small tiled house and he is using the same after

                      obtaining the patta. The defendants never encroached any portion

                      perfected the title to the suit property by way of prescription. The

                      Ex.A.5. According to those documents, the plaintiff is having the

                      property measuring an extent of 15 cents in Survey No.71/22.

                      In respect of those documents, on the side of the defendants did not

                      raise any objection particularly about the genuineness of the said

                      documents.

                      the defendants was situated on the eastern side of the suit

                      property. Now, the crux of the case is nothing, but the plaintiff and

                      defendants claim that the land measuring an extent of four cents,

                      which was situated in between the above two survey numbers are

</p><p id="p_24">                               12.It is the specific case of the defendants is that they are

                      having the land measuring an extent of 11 cents comprised in

                      survey No.71/23. According to them, the said land was purchased

                      in the name of the second defendant through Ex.B.1.           In fact,

                      before the trial Court, during the time of trial, the learned trial

                      Judge appointed the Advocate Commissioner for         the purpose of

                      noting down the physical features. Consequentially, the report filed

                      by the Advocate Commissioner was marked as Ex.C.1. In the said

                      report, the Advocate Commissioner mentioned the disputed area as

                      'XYZ'.

                      is in the continues possession of the defendants by putting up the

                      stone pillars and iron fence and thereby they are perfected the title

                      to the disputed property by way of adverse possession. In the said

                      circumstances, on going through the pleadings set out in the

                      written statement, the defendant have not stated anything about

                      the putting up the stone pillars and iron fence.    Further, he has

                      stated about the date on which the defendant entered into the

                      possession of the said property. Even though the defendants gave

                      an evidence as the stone wall found in the western boundary was

                      fell down, in order to prove the same he has not produced any

                      relevant document.    More than that, on going through Ex.B.1 the

                      sale deed through which the defendant purchased his property,

                      there is no recital in respect to the stone wall found in the western

                      boundary.   So without showing the substantial evidence in respect

                      to the long enjoyment, it cannot be said that the defendant

                      perfected the title to the disputed property by way of adverse

                      possession. Further on the side of the defendants, in order to prove

                      the possession except the sale deed stands in the name of the

                      second defendant, no other document for proving the possession,

                      was exhibited.

                      admitted the disputed portion which mentioned as 'XYZ' belongs to

                      the plaintiff. Accordingly, after admitting that the disputed portion

                      is the property of the plaintiff, claiming the same by stating that the

                      the said property belongs to them by way of adverse possession,

                      cannot be entertained.        As per the recital found in Ex.A.4, UDR

                      patta in Survey No.71/22, the plaintiff is having the property

                      measuring an extent of 14.82 cents.

</p><p id="p_32">                                16.Now on considering the report filed by the Advocate

                      Commissioner, if the property covered as 'XYZ' was included in

                      Survey No.71/22, it will come out to an extent of around 15 cents.

                      So in all respects, the plaintiff has proved his case through the

                      document Ex.A.1 to Ex.A.5 as well as through the report filed by

                      the Advocate Commissioner. So the Courts below after appreciating

                      the said factual aspects, came to the conclusion that the plaintiff

                      has proved his case and decreed the suit.       So adverting to the

                      recital found in Ex.B.1, is not at all necessary for disposing this

                      appeal.   It is the well settled proposition that the patta will not

                      confer the title. However, if the property is ancestral in character

                      or assigned by the Government, only the patta will be available as a

                      document to the title.    In otherwise, we cannot expect the title

                      deeds for all the properties, which found under the dispute. For

                      example if the property is assigned to a person and the said person

                      sold the same to any other person, there may be a chance for

                      creating the title deed in otherwise the patta alone stands in favour

                      of the person who hold possession.       In this case also, only by

                      applying the said proposition the Courts below came to the

                      conclusion that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief of recovery of

                      possession.
