             order impugned mainly on the ground that the petitioners though

             were appointed on compassionate ground, but were appointed as

             Assistant Teacher and as such, they were provided the pay-scale of

             Assistant Teacher, which was drawn by petitioners. It is specific

             stand of the petitioners in all the cases that they never

             misrepresented or misled the authority concerned for obtaining

             salary, which has been alleged by the respondents as excess. It has

             been argued that though petitioners were appointed as Assistant

             Teacher, but the respondents had taken many other works from

             them, such as; work on election duty, invigilation etc. In none of the

             cases, there is any allegation that petitioners voluntarily did not

             discharge the duty as Assistant Teacher. Once they were appointed

             as Assistant Teacher, whether the respondents had taken work

             from them as Assistant Teacher or otherwise, the respondents

             were not at all entitled to take a decision at subsequent stage to

             recover any amount from the paid salary to the petitioners on the

             plea that no teaching work was taken from the petitioners. It has

             been emphatically argued that petitioners were Class III employee

             and there was no allegation of misrepresentation or commission of

             any fraud and they had drawn salary as Assistant Teacher since

             they    were     appointed       as   Assistant   Teacher,   ofcourse   on

             compassionate ground. Learned counsel for the petitioners have

             placed heavy reliance on a recent judgment of the Apex Court

             reported in 2015( 1) PLJR(SC) 261 { State of Punjab and others

             Vs. Rafique Masih (White Washer)}. It has been argued by

             learned counsel for petitioners that in view of Rafique Masih's case

             (supra), now issue has already been set at rest.

<p id="p_238">                            9. Ofcourse, aforesaid writ petitions were filed in the

             year 2011, but till the date on which order was reserved, in number

             of cases, no counter affidavit was filed on behalf of the respondents,

             however; in 1st case (i.e. C.W.J.C. No. 15885 of 2011), counter

             affidavit was filed on behalf of the respondents. Similarly, in some

             other cases, counter affidavit was filed, but common ground was

             taken that the decision was taken to recover the amount on the

             basis of objection raised by the office of Accountant General that it

             was a case of unproductive expense and as such, it was required to

             be recovered. A common stand has been taken that though

             petitioners were appointed as Assistant Teacher, for longer period

             they had not discharged any teaching work. However, it has been

             admitted that from them, work was taken in relation to election

             duty, invigilation etc. A plea has been taken that from the date of

             their appointment till their posting in their school, the petitioners

             had received payment, which was found to be unproductive

             expense and same objection was raised by the audit team of

             Accountant General.

             order impugned was passed after giving full opportunity to the

             petitioners to explain as to whether they had discharged duty of

             teaching work or not.

             have also perused the materials available on record. It is not in

             dispute that petitioners were appointed as Assistant Teacher.
</p>
<p id="p_241">             Whether from them teaching work was taken or not, it was

             responsibility of the respondent/State. It is not a case that no work

             was taken from the petitioners. Once, they were paid salary as

             Assistant Teacher on which post they were appointed, at

             subsequent stage, the respondents were not all authorized to take

             step for recovery of any amount on the plea that it was

             unproductive expenses. It is undisputed that petitioners had not

             made any misrepresentation or had committed any fraud in getting

             the pay-scale of Assistant Teacher. Once petitioners were

             appointed as Assistant Teacher, it was incumbent on the part of the

             respondents to take work from them as teacher. Instead of taking

             work as Teacher, some other work was taken from the petitioners.

             Supreme Court has already laid down a law that in such cases, no

             recovery can been effected. At this juncture, the Court proposes to
