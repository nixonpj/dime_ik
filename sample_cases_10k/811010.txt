 CITATOR INFO :
 R	    1970 SC  21	 (6,9)


ACT:
<a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_1">Indian	Electricity  Act</a>  (9  of  1910), <a href="/doc/16467/" id="a_2"> s.   3(2)(e)</a>-Board
supplying energy to consumer at lower rate than to licensee,
whether	 discriminatory-Notification  directing	 supply	  to
consumer, requirements.



HEADNOTE:
The- petitioner company a licensee was supplying  electrical
energy	to the 3rd respondent.	By the Electric	 Supply	 Act
1948  the  Electricity Board was constituted and  by  Indian
Electricity  (U.P.) <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_3">Amendment Act</a>, 1961, the  disability  of
the Board to supply directly electrical energy to  consumers
such   as  the	3rd  respondent	 was  removed.	 The   State
Government  issued  a notification directing  the  Board  to
directly  supply  energy to the 3rd respondent.	  The  rates
chargeable  by	the Board for energy supplied  to  licensees
were  higher than the rates the direct consumers.   The	 3rd
respondent  terminated	the agreement  with  the  petitioner
company.  The petitioner company filed a petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_4">Art.
32</a> of the Constitution.
HELD  :	 (Per Full Court) : The notification  could  not  be
sustained as a valid notification as it was  discriminatory.
If  the	 Board	were to supply energy directly	to  the	 3rd
respondent it had to do so at rates lower than the rates  at
which  electricity  was	 supplied by it	 to  the  petitioner
company' The petitioner-company being thus charged at higher
rates  must  as a distributor charge higher rates  from	 its
other  consumers  with the result that	the  3rd  respondent
would  get  energy at substantially lower rates	 than  other
Consumers  including other industrial establishments in	 the
area.	The  notification thus	resulted  in  discrimination
between	 the  3rd  respondent  on the  one  hand  the  other
consumers  on the other as also between the, 3rd  respondent
and the petitioner company. [319 B-D]
(Per Wanchoo C.J., Sikri, Shelat and Vaidialingam, JJ.). The
Board  ,could not have distributed energy to  the  consumers
though it was a licensee under 1910 Act unless (a) there was
a  scheme or (b) that it was authorised in  public  interest
under  the  amended <a href="/doc/16467/" id="a_5"> s.	 3(2)(e)</a>.   Neither  of	 these	 two
,conditions having been fulffilled the notification and	 the
direction contained therein to the Board to supply energy to
the  3rd  respondent  were  in	breach	of  the	 petitioner-
company's rights under its licences and the, requirements of
the amended<a href="/doc/1139188/" id="a_6"> s. 3</a> (2) (a). [3 1 8 H]
The   allegation  that	the-  3rd  respondent  suffered	  in
production  and	 losses as a result of	short  or  defective
supply	by the petitioner-company was not borne out  by	 the
record in this case. if there was any justification for	 the
allegation  now made by the respondents it is  inconceivable
that  for all these years the 3rd respondent would not	have
made  any complaint for such defective supply either to	 the
Board or to the State Government.
(Per  Bhargava, J.) The notification cannot be held  to	 be-
invalid	 on the ground that it was issued in breach  of	 the
amended<a href="/doc/1139188/" id="a_7"> s. 3</a> (e) of the Act.
If the State Government was competent under the original <a href="/doc/1139188/" id="a_8"> s.
3</a>  (2)	(e)  of the Act of 1910 to grant a  licence  to	 any
person for supply of electricity
313
in  the	 areas	covered	 by  the,  licences  issued  to	 the
petitioner-company , it cannot be seen why a similar  result
could  not  be validly brought about by legislation  by	 the
appropriate  legislatures creating a statutory licensee	 for
purposes of the Act of 1910.  Consequently the power granted
to  the	 Electricity  Board by the  notification  to  supply
electricity to a consumer in the area covered by one of	 the
licences  of the petitioner-company could not be held to  be
in violation of the conditions of the licence.
In  view of the language of the provisions contained in	 the
amended	 3 (2) (e) of the Act of 1910, it was not  competent
for  this  Court  in this writ	petition,  on  the  material
available, to declare that the notification was invalid	 for
the reason that the direction contained therein was not made
by  the State Government in public interests As long as	 the
State  Government  based its order on an opinion  formed  on
relevant material, it was not open to the courts to  examine
and take a different view on the, basis of other  materials.

VAIDIALINGAM, JJ. was delivered by SHELAT, J. BHARGAVA,	 J.,
delivered a separate opinion.
</p><p id="p_5">Shelat, J. On August 17, 1934 the Governor-in-Council of the
then United Provinces, in exercise of powers under<a href="/doc/1139188/" id="a_10"> s. 3</a>	 (1)
of  the	 <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_11">Indian	 Electricity Act</a>, IX of	 1910  issued  three
licences  to M/s.  Alopi Parshad &amp; Sons Ltd. for the  supply
of electrical energy within the tahsil areas of Firozabad in
the  district of Agra Shikohabad in the district of  Manipur
and  Etawah in the district of Etawah.	The  licences  inter
alia provided that the licensee would be supplied electrical
energy in bulk by the Public Works Department, U.P. and	 the
licensee  in  its-turn should transmit the same on  its	 own
high  tension mains within the areas of the  licences.	 The
licences  also	provided  that the  responsibility  for	 the
maintenance   of   supply  of  electrical  energy   in	 the
licensee's,  plant  shall be borne entirely  by	 the  Public
Works  Department and thereafter by the licensee.   In	1937
the  licences were assigned by the said M/s.  Alopi  Parshad
and Sons Ltd. to the petitioner company with the consent  of
the Government.	 The petitioner company has since then	been
supplying  under the said licences electricity to  consumers
within the said areas of the licences.	It is an admitted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">314</span>
position  that	though the petitioner company had  the	said
licences assigned to it it did not acquire any exclusive  or
monopolistic right of supplying electrical energy within the
said  areas.   Clause  (e) of sec. 3(2) of  1910  Act  which
governed  the  said licences provides that the	grant  of  a
licence	 thereunder shall not in any way hinder or  restrict
the  grant  of a licence to another person within  the	same
area of supply for a like purpose.
</p><p id="p_6"><a href="/doc/701121/" id="a_12">The  Electricity  (Supply)  Act</a>, LIV  of  1948	(hereinafter
referred to as 1948 Act) by sec. 5(1) enjoins upon the State
Government  to constitute a State Electricity  Board.	Sec.
19(1) provides that the Board may, subject to the provisions
of  this Act, supply electricity to any licensee  or  person
requiring  such	 supply	 in  any  area	in  which  a  scheme
sanctioned under Chapter V is in force.	 The proviso to Sec.
19(1), however, lays down that the Board shall not :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "(b) supply electricity for any purpose to any
	      person,  not being a licensee for use  in	 any
	      part  of	the  area of  supply  of  a  licence
	      without  the consent of the  licensee,  unless
	      the  maximum demand of the licensee,  being  a
	      distributing  licensee and taking a supply  of
	      energy in bulk is, at the time of the request,
	      less  than twice the maximum demand asked	 for
	      by any such person; or the licensee is  unable
	      or  unwilling to supply electricity  for	such
	      purpose  in  the	said part of  such  area  on
	      reasonable  terms and conditions and within  a
	      reasonable time."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      <a href="/doc/1071792/" id="a_13">Section 26</a> provides that
	      "Subject	to the provisions of this  Act,	 the
	      Board  shall, in respect of the  whole  State,
	      have  all	 the  powers and  obligations  of  a
	      licenses,	 under the <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_14">Indian  Electricity	Act</a>,
	      1910,  and this Act shall-be deemed to be	 the
	      licence of the Board for the purposes of	that
	      Act."
</blockquote><p id="p_7">The  definition	 of  a	licensee in<a href="/doc/938893/" id="a_15"> s.	2(6)</a>  of  1948	Act,
however, states that it would not include the Board.  Though
the Board is not a licensee for the purposes of the 1948 Act
the  Act being deemed to be the licence for the Board  under
Sec.  26  it  is a licensee under the  1910  Act.   Sec.  26
however is subject to the provisions of the Act which  means
that it is inter alia subject to the provisions of sec.	 19.
Therefore,  in the absence of a scheme under Chapter V,	 the
Board,	though	a  licensee  under the	1910  Act,  was	 not
competent to supply directly electrical energy to  consumers
such  as  the 3rd respondent.  This was the  position  until
1961, When the U.P. legislature to remove this disability of
the  Board, passed the Indian Electricity  (U.P.)  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_16">Amendment
Act</a>,   XXX  of	1961.	<a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_17">Section	 2</a>  of	the  Amendment	 Act
substituted  the following, for cl. (e) of sec. 3(2) of	 the
1910 Act:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">315</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      "(e)  grant of a licence under this  Part	 for
	      any  purpose  shall not in any way  hinder  or
	      restrict-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	      (i)   the	 grant of licence to another  person
	      within  the  same area of supply	for  a	like
	      purpose; or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	      (ii)  the	 supply	 of  energy  by	 the   State
	      Government  or  the  State  Electricity  Board
	      wihin   the   same  area,	 where	 the   State
	      Government  deems	 such  supply  necessary  in
	      public interest."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	      It also added after sub-sec. 2, the  following
	      sub-sec. 3:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	      "(3) Where the supply of energy in any area of
	      the   State   Electricity	 Board	 is   deemed
	      necessary	 under subclause (ii) of clause	 (e)
	      of sub-section (2), the Board may, subject  to
	      any terms and conditions that may be laid down
	      by the State Government, supply energy in that
	      area notwithstanding anything to the  contrary
	      contained	 in  this  Act	or  the	 <a href="/doc/701121/" id="a_18">Electricity
	      Supply Act</a>, 1948."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	      Sec.  3 of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_19">Amendment Act</a> also added a	 new
	      sub-sec.	(1-B)  in sec. 28 of the  1910	Act.
	      The new sub-section reads as under:--
	      "(1-B).	  The	 State	  Government	 may
	      notwithstanding that sanction for engaging  in
	      the  business  of	 supplying  energy  to	 the
	      consumer	in  an area has been  given  to	 any
	      person  under sub-section (1), whether  before
	      or  after	 coming	 into force  of	 the  Indian
	      Electricity (U.P. Sanshodhan) Adhiniyam, 1961,
	      give  direct  supply, or authorise  the  State
	      Electricity  Board to give direct	 supply,  in
	      the same area."
</blockquote><p id="p_8">This sub-section has no application to the licensees for, it
empowers  the State Government either to supply directly  or
authorise  the	Board to directly supply energy even  in  an
area for which it has given sanction to a person other	than
a licensee to engage in the business of supplying energy  to
the public in such area.
</p><p id="p_9">A perusal of these provisions makes it clear that the  Board
can  directly  supply electricity to the consumers  and	 the
State  Government  also	 can authorise the Board  to  do  so
provided  the State Government deems it necessary in  public
interest that it should be so done.  The condition precedent
for  the direct supply by the Board to the consumers in	 the
area where a licence has been granted to a licensee is	that
such  supply  by the Board must be deemed necessary  by	 the
State Government in public interest.
</p><p id="p_10">In pursuance of the powers under sees. 46 and 49 of the 1948
Act, the Board by a notification dated April 24, 1962  fixed
the  rates and tariffs for electrical energy for the  Ganga-
Sarda
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">316</span>
Grid.	These were to apply to both the licensees  obtaining
bulk  supply  from  the	 Board	and  to	 consumers  to	whom
electrical energy was being supplied direct by the Board  in
the  area  covered  by the said Grid.	According  to  these
rates,	consumers  to  whom  electrical	 energy	 was   being
supplied  direct by the Board would pay a demand  charge  at
the rate of Rs. 8/- per KVA and on energy charge at the rate
of 4.5nP per KWH for the first 170 KWH per KVA, at the	rate
of 3.5nP for the next 170 KWH per KVA and at the rate of 3.0
nP per KWH for the remaining KVA consumed during the  month.
For the licensees, the rates were Rs. 12.75 per KVA for	 the
demand charge for the first 500 KVA, Rs. 10 per KVA for	 the
next 1500 KVA and Rs. 8.50 per KVA for above 2000 KVA of the
chargeable demand during the month.  For energy charge,	 the
rates  were 5 nP per KWH for the first 170 KVM per KVA,	 4nP
per KWH for the next 170 KWH per KVA and 3nP per KWH for the
remaining  KWH per KVA of chargeable demand consumed  during
the  month.  The rates chargeable from licensees  were	thus
higher	than  those  applicable to  the	 consumers  both  in
respect	 of demand and energy charges even though  licensees
would be larger customs who in the normal course of business
would  be  charged  lower rates	 than  the  consumers.	 The
notification is not under challenge before us and- therefore
it is not necessary for us to consider its validity.
As the Board was not yet authorised by the State  Government
to  supply electricity directly to the consumers within	 the
areas	of  the	 petitioner  company's	licences   the	 3rd
respondent entered into an agreement in 1964 for a period of
3  years  under which the petitioner company was  to  supply
electricity  to	 it.   On  September  21,  1966	 the   State
Government  issued  a  notification which  stated  that	 the
Governor  deemed  it necessary in public interest  that	 the
State  should  supply energy to the 3rd	 respondent  and  in
exercise  of the power under sec. 3 (2) (e) of the 1910	 Act
as  amended  by Act XXX of 1961 directed the Board  to	give
direct	supply of energy to the 3rd respondent on the-	same
terms and conditions on which the Board was supplying energy
I  to other consumers.	Thereupon the 3rd respondent by	 its
notice dated January 19, 1967 terminated the said agreement.
It seems that the Board was still not ready to supply energy
direct	to  the 3rd respondent and therefore  on  April	 18,
1967,  only  one day before the said  agreement	 would	have
ended, the 3rd respondent withdrew the said notice.  On June
23  1967, the 3rd respondent, however, gave a  fresh  notice
terminating  the said agreement as from September 23,  1967.
The result of the notification dated September 21, 1966	 was
two-fold  : (1) that notwithstanding the subsistence of	 the
petitioner  company's licences and its right  thereunder  to
supply energy to consumers within the areas of its licences,
the Board
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">317</span>
was directed to supply energy to the 3rd respondent and	 (2)
that  the  Board was directed to supply energy	to  the	 3rd
respondent at rates lower than the rate charged by the Board
from the petitioner company as the licensee.
Mr.  Chagla appearing for the petitioner company raised	 the
following three contentions :
</p><p id="p_11">(  1  ) that the amended sec. 3 (2) (e) was invalid  on	 the
ground	that  it amounted to acquisition of  the  petitioner
company's property and as no compensation has been  provided
for such acquisition cl. (e) of<a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_20"> s. 3</a> (2) was in violation of
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_21">Art. 31(2)</a> of the Constitution;
</p><p id="p_12">(2)  that  the	notification dated September  21,  1966	 was
ultra  vires  sec. 3 (2) (e) as the direction by  the  State
Government  to the Board to supply electricity	directly  to
the 3rd respondent was not founded on public interest; and
(3)  that the said direction to supply electricity at rates-
chargeable   from  the	consumers  as  against	 the   rates
chargeable to the licensees was discriminatory.
The  respondents, on the other hand, contended that the	 3rd
respondent  was	 a concern in which the	 Government  has  an
interest  to the extent of 51 % of its share  capital,	that
therefore,  it	was almost a public  utility  concern,	that
supply	by the petitioner company to the 3rd respondent	 was
found  to  be defective resulting in lay off  of  labour  on
several occasions and consequent loss in production and that
therefore the Government was justified in public interest to
issue	the   said  notification.   In	support	  of   these
allegations  the  respondents  filed an	 annexure  to  their
counter	 affidavit  showing  low voltage  and  high  tension
trippings during the months of April, May and June 1966.  It
was alleged that owing to defective and short supply by	 the
petitioner  company  there Were high  tension  trappings  on
numerous occasions resulting in low voltage, the consequence
Whereof was that the 3rd respondent was obliged to stop	 the
working	 of  the  Mills sometimes for  several	hours.	 The
petitioner   company's	 case,	however,  was	that   these
allegations were an afterthought and that the real object in
issuing	 the  notification dated September 21, 1966  was  to
subvert	 the  petitioner  company's rights  under  the	said
licences.
</p><p id="p_13">We are inclined to think that there is considerable force in
the  contention	 of  the  petitioner  company.	 Though	 the
allegation  was	 that  supply of energy	 by  the  petitioner
company	 to  the 3rd respondent suffered from  shortage	 and
other  defects the 3rd respondent does not seem to  have  at
any  time made any complaint about such shortage or  defects
either	to the petitioner company or to the Board or to	 the
State Government.  Similarly, the Board also does
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">318</span>
not  seem to have at any time complained to  the  petitioner
company	  about	 such  defective  supply.   Even  when	 the
petitioner company, after the said notification was  issued,
made a representation to the State Government to  reconsider
its  decision  the Government did not, while  rejecting	 it,
rely upon the fact that the petitioner company was not in  a
position to give full and proper supply of energy to the 3rd
respondent  or that supply by it was, as now alleged,  short
or defective.  It is an undisputed fact that the  petitioner
company	 has been throughout all these years supplying	high
tension energy to the 3rd respondent and the 3rd  respondent
has  been  converting  such high  tension  energy  into	 low
tension energy through its own transformers.  The  aforesaid
annexure  shows that though the high tension trippings	were
only for a few minutes except on three or four occasions low
voltage	 was for several hours.	 In some cases though  there
was no tripping at all there was low voltage for as long  as
sixteen hours.	It is clear, therefore, that the  petitioner
company	 had  no difficulty in maintaining  supply  of	high
tension	 electrical energy to the 3rd respondent  and  there
must  have been some defect in the stepping down system	 of.
the  3rd  respondent  resulting	 in  low  voltage.   It	  is
impossible   thus  to  find  from  the	annexure  that	 the
petitioner  company was guilty in any manner of shortage  or
defective   supply  of	high  tension  energy  to  the	 3rd
respondent.    The   allegation	 therefore  that   the	 3rd
respondent suffered in production and losses as a result  of
short  or defective supply by the petitioner company is	 not
borne  out  by the record in this case.	 If  there  was	 any
justification for the allegation now made by the respondents
it  is	inconceivable  that  for all  these  years  the	 3rd
respondent  would  not	have made  any	complaint  for	such
defective  supply  either  to  the Board  or  to  the  State
Government.
</p><p id="p_14">It  is certain that but for the amendment of sec. 3 (2)	 (e)
of  1910 Act, the Board, though a licensee under  that	Act,
could	not  have  supplied  energy  directly  to  the	 3rd
respondent in the absence of a scheme under sec. 19 of	1948
Act.  Under the proviso to that section the Board would	 not
have  been entitled to supply energy for any purpose to	 any
person not being a licensee for use in any part of the	area
of  supply  of	a  licensee  without  the  consent  of	such
licensee.  It is true that under its licences the petitioner
company	 was  not conferred monopolistic  rights  to  supply
energy	to  the	 consumers and	the  Government	 could	have
granted	 another  licence  to  another	licensee.   But	 the
Government has not granted such licence to any other person.
But  it was said that the Board was another  such  licensee.
As  already  stated  the Board could  not  have	 distributed
energy	to the consumers though it is a licensee under	1910
Act  unless  (a)  there	 was a scheme or  (b)  that  it	 was
authorised  in public interest under the amended sec. 3	 (2)
</p><p id="p_15">(e).  Neither of these two conditions having been  fulfilled
it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">319</span>
is clear that the notification of September 21, 1966 and the
direction contained therein to the Board to supply energy to
the  3rd  respondent  were  in	breach	of  the	  petitioner
company's rights under its licences and the requirements  of
the amended sec. 3 (2) (e).
</p><p id="p_16">Apart from its being in breach of the amended sec. 3 (2) (e)
and the petitioner company's rights under its licences,	 the
notification  and  the Government's direct on to  the  Board
therein results in clear discrimination.  If the Board	were
to supply energy directly to the 3rd respondent it has to do
so  at	rates lower than the rates at which  electricity  is
supplied  by it to the petitioner company.   The  petitioner
company	 being	thus  charged  at higher  rates	 must  as  a
distributor  charge  hi-her rates from its  other  consumers
with the result that the 3rd respondent would get energy  at
substantially  lower  rates than other	consumers  including
other	industrial   establishments  in	  the	area.	 The
notification thus results in discrimination between the	 3rd
respondent  on the one hand and the other consumers  on	 the
other as also between the 3rd respondent and the  petitioner
company.
</p><p id="p_17">It follows therefore that the notification of September	 21,
1966  cannot be sustained as a valid notification as  it  is
discriminatory	and is also in breach of the amended sec.  3
(2) (e) of 1910 Act.  In that view the Board is not entitled
to supply directly electricity to the 3rd respondent as	 the
direction  contained in the said notification which  is	 the
only authority under which it could so supply is invalid  in
law.  In this view, it is not necessary for us to decide the
question  whether  the	amended sec. 3 (2)  (e)	 amounts  to
acquisition and whether such acquisition is in violation  of
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_22">Art.  31</a> of the Constitution.  The said	 notification  being
thus invalid respondents 1 and 2 are directed not to, supply
electrical  energy  directly  to the  3rd  respondent.	 The
respondents will pay to the petitioner company the costs  of
this petition.
</p><p id="p_18">Bhargava,  J.  I agree with my brother Shelat  J.  that	 the
notification of September 21, 1966 cannot be sustained as  a
valid	notification  because  it  is	discriminatory	 and
consequently  I concur in the order proposed by him.  I	 am,
however, not prepared to hold that that notification is also
invalid,   on  the  other  two	grounds,  viz.,	  that	 the
notification  and  the directions contained  therein  to  he
Electricity  Board to supply energy to the third  respondent
were in breach of the petitioner Company's rights under	 its
licence and of The requirements of the amended <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_23">section 3</a> (a)
</p><p id="p_19">(e).  I may briefly indicate the reasons for my view.
It  is	admitted on all hands that under its  licences,	 the
petitioner company was not conferred monopolistic rights  to
supply energy
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">320</span>
to  the	 consumers in the area covered by the  licences	 and
that  Government  could	 have  granted	another	 licence  to
another licensee to supply energy in the same areas  without
violating any provision of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_24">Electricity Act</a> of 1910 or of
the  conditions	 or  which  licences  were  granted  to	 the
petitioner Company.  It in true that the Government has	 not
granted	 any  such licences to any other person but,  in  my
opinion the effect of the subsequent legislation is to bring
into   existence  another  statutory  licencee	 viz.,	 the
Electricity  Board and any directions permitting  the  Elec-
tricity Board to supply electricity in the areas covered  by
the  petitioner Company's licences cannot be held to  be  in
violation  of  the  conditions of those	 licences.   By	 the
Electric  Supply  Act  1948, the Board	'was  constituted  a
licensee for purposes of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_25">Electricity Act</a> of 1910, though
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_26">section	 26</a>, which brought about this result, provided	that
in that capacity, the Board was subject to other  provisions
of  the	 Electric Supply Act 1948.  One	 such  provision  is
contained  in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_27"> s.  19(1)</a>  of the  Act  of  1948.   The	U.P.
Electricity  Amendment Act 1961, however, introduced  provi-
sions  in the Act of 1910 the result of which was  that	 the
Board, in acting as a licensee under the Act of 1910, was no
longer	subject to the limitation laid down in<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_28"> s.  19(1)</a>  of
the Act of 1948.  It has not been contended that either	 the
<a href="/doc/701121/" id="a_29">Supply Act</a> of 1948 or 'the U.P. Electricity Amendment Act of
1961   was  not	 competently  enacted  by  the	 appropriate
legislature.  <a href="/doc/701121/" id="a_30">The Supply Act</a> of 1948 was no doubt passed  by
the  Central Legislature in respect of a concurrent  subject
but the U.P. Electricity Amendment Act of 1961 was  reserved
for  the  assent of the President and, having  received	 the
assent	of the President, the provisions of that  Act  would
prevail to the extent to which they may be inconsistent with
the,  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_31">Central Act</a> of 1948.  The result of  that	 legislation
was  that the Electricity Board became a licensee under	 the
<a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_32">Electricity  Act</a>  of 1910 and was no longer subject  to	 the
limitation  laid down in<a href="/doc/1711355/" id="a_33"> s. 19(1)</a> of the Electricity  Supply
Act of 1948.  The only limitation after the enactment of the
U.P.  Electricity Amendment Act 1961 that remained was	that
the  Board  could supply electricity only after	 the  Stat--
Government  issued a valid notification under clause (e)  of
<a href="/doc/1952875/" id="a_34">section	 3(2)</a> of the Act of 1910.  If the  State  Government
was competent under the original <a href="/doc/1952875/" id="a_35">section 3(2)</a> (e) of the Act
of  1910  to  grant a licence to any person  for  supply  of
electricity  in the areas covered by the licences issued  to
the  petitioner Company, I do not see why v  similar  result
could  not be validly brought about by legislation,  by	 the
appropriate  legislatures creating a statutory licensee	 for
purposes  of  the  Act of  1910.   Consequently,  the  power
granted	 to  the Electricity Board by  the  notification  of
September  21, 1966 to supply electricity to a	consumer  in
the  area covered by one of the licences of  "he  petitioner
Company cannot be, held to be in violation of the conditions
of the licence.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">321</span>
<p id="p_20">I  further considered that, in view of the language  of	 the
provisions contained in the amended <a href="/doc/1952875/" id="a_36">section 3(2)</a> (e) of	 the
Act of 1910, it is not competent for this Court in this writ
petition,  on  the material available, to declare  that	 the
notification  of September 21, 1966 is invalid	because	 the
direction  contained  therein  was not	made  by  the  State
Government in public interest.	The power under the  amended
<a href="/doc/1526580/" id="a_37">section	 3</a> (2) (e) is to be exercised when Government  deems
it  necessary in public interest.  The notification, on	 the
face  of it, shows that the State Government did  apply	 its
mind  before issuing that notification and form the  opinion
that  in  this particular case it was  necessary  in  public
interest  that	the  Board  should  be	directed  to  supply
electricity  to respondent No. 3 in the area covered by	 one
of the licences of the petitioner Company.  The opinion	 was
formed by the.	State Government on material which I do	 not
think  can be said to be totally irrelevant for the  purpose
of  forming such opinion.  As long as the  State  Government
based  its order on an opinion formed on relevant  material,
it is not open to the courts to examine and take a different
view-  on  the	basis  of other material  such	as  want  of
complaints  by respondent No. 3 to the Government  that	 the
supply	 of  energy  by	 the  petitioner  Company  was	 not
satisfactory.  It is not for courts to sit in judgment	over
the view of the State Government which the State  Government
is  required  to form in order to make an  order  under	 the
amended <a href="/doc/1526580/" id="a_38">section 3</a> (2) (e).  Consequently, I cannot hold that
the  notification of September 21, 1966 was invalid  on	 the
ground	that it was issued in breach of the amended  <a href="/doc/1952875/" id="a_39">section
3(2)</a> (e) of the Act of 1910.
