09.12.2013


       Ms. Neetu Prajapati, learned counsel for the petitioner.

       Heard on the question of admission.

       Issue notice.

       Shri S.K. Shrivastava, learned Panel Lawyer appeared and
waives notice on behalf of respondents.</pre>

<p id="p_1">       By this writ petition, the petitioner has called in question
the order dated 17.7.2013 Annx.P/3, by which the Commissioner
has dismissed the appeal of the petitioner against the order of
the Collector Tikamgarh. Earlier a writ petition was filed by the
petitioner before this Court which was registered as Writ Petition
No.4620/2007.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       Considering the fact that the order passed by the
authority below was appealable, the said writ petition was
disposed of vide order dated 2.7.2007 granting liberty to the
petitioner to file an appeal within a period of 30 days from the
date of order before the competent appellate authority and the
said   authority   was    directed   to   decide   the   said   appeal
expeditiously. On filing of an appeal, the Collector Tikamgarh
dismissed the same vide order dated 23.11.2007, against which
a second appeal was filed by the petitioner, but since the second
appeal was barred by limitation, the same was dismissed. It is
contended that this order was not rightly passed as facts
relating to the explanation of the delay were not rightly
appreciated.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       It is not disputed by learned Panel Lawyer appearing on
behalf of respondents that the appeal has not been decided on
           merits.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                Keeping in view the aforesaid, the order dated 17.7.2013
          is hereby quashed, with the direction to the respondent-
          Commissioner to hear and decide the appeal of the petitioner on
          merits ignoring the limitation. It is made clear that this Court
          has not looked into the merits of the appeal filed by the
          petitioner before the appellate authority which has to be
          decided on merit by the said authority expeditiously, preferably,
          within a period of three months from the date of receipt of
          certified copy of the order passed today.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                With the aforesaid, the writ petition stands disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                Certified copy as per rules.
</p>


<p id="p_7">                                                (K.K.Trivedi)
                                                   Judge

A.Praj.
