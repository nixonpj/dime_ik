approached this Court seeking permission for terminating the pregnancy

carried by her which is stated to be of about 24 weeks duration. The

mother of the victim has lodged the First Information Report with Kurar

Police Station, Malad, Mumbai in respect of commission of offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_1">Sections 376(3)</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_2">506</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and

was directed to be examined by the Medical Board constituted by Sir J.J.

Group of Hospitals and Grant Medical College, Mumbai. The Medical Board

consists of Professors and Head of Department of Obstetrics and

Gynecology, Professor and Head of the Department of Psychiatry, Professor

of Radiology, the Professor and Head of the Department of Cardiology and

the Professor and Head of Department of Neurology.

that the victim is not suffering from any mental illness. However, the

alleged pregnancy is caused by rape, the anguish caused by such pregnancy

further reported that the victim is fit to undergo the procedure of MTP

from psychiatric point of view.

<p id="p_6">            The Professor and Head of the Department of Cardiology reported

that there does not appear any abnormality in heart and the heart is

compatible for fetal and extra-uterine life. However, there are multiple

birth anomalies which require further investigation and attention and

termination can be done.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">5.           The Committee has unanimously reported that continuation of

pregnancy in minor may lead to pregnancy related complications like

anemia, pregnancy induced hypertension as well as complications during

labour. The girl is also undergoing psychological impact with uncertain

future. The victim is also suffering from a psychological problem. Since it is

further reported that since pregnancy has advanced to 24 weeks, well

beyond legal limit of termination of pregnancy, i.e., 20 weeks, the

termination can only be done with the due permission from the High

Court. The Committee has reported that the continuation of pregnancy will

have physical and mental stress to minor-mother. Hence it is advisable to

terminate the pregnancy.

Division Bench of this Court in the case of Shaikh Ayesha Khatoon Vs.

Union of India and Others1 has held that the contingencies prescribed in

<a href="/doc/200125/" id="a_6">Section 3(2)(i)</a> &amp; (ii) of the <a href="/doc/634810/" id="a_7">Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act</a>, 1971

(The MTP Act, 1971) shall have to be read while interpreting Section 5 of

the MTP Act, 1971 and the ground referred to in the aforesaid provisions

are inherent and shall be read in Section 5 of the MTP Act, 1971. The

explanation to Section 3 of the MTP Act, 1971 prescribes that where any

pregnancy is alleged by the pregnant woman to have been caused by rape,

the anguish caused by such pregnancy shall be presumed to constitute a

grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman.


</p><p id="p_11">7.           The pregnant minor girl is a victim of physical abuse and as such she

has a choice and her decision to terminate the pregnancy is required to be

taken into account. The freedom to make choice by the woman which is an

integral part of personal liberty cannot be taken away. It shall also be

taken into consideration that besides physical injury, the legislature has

widened the scope of the termination of pregnancy by including "injury" to

mental health of the pregnant woman also, to be a valid ground. In the

instant matter, though pregnancy is alleged to be a result of physical abuse,

the choice of victim of rape of terminating unwanted pregnancy needs to

be respected. The Medical Board, after examination of the victim, has

permission to the pregnant minor girl to terminate the pregnancy.

would like to carry out the procedure to terminate the pregnancy at Sir J.J.

Medical College, is directed to carry the procedure to terminate the

pregnancy under the supervision of team of medical experts which shall

include               expert   Gynecologist   and   Obstetrician,     Psychiatrist         and

Paediatrician.

<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">9.           Since the pregnancy carried by the victim minor girl is as a result of

physical abuse and the First Information Report has already been lodged, it

would be appropriate to direct the Dean of the Medical College to preserve

the tissue sample and blood sample of the foetus for carrying out necessary

medical tests including DNA, finger printing/mapping. The Investigating

Officer conducting investigation in the matter shall ensure that the samples

of tissues and blood etc. shall be forwarded to the Regional Forensic

Laboratory, Aurangabad for DNA, Finger printing/mapping and for

carrying necessary tests and the samples and report shall be preserved for
