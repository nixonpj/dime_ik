                                  Nakuleswar Ghosh.
                                        Versus
                            The State of West Bengal &amp; ors.


               Mr. Biswajit Mal         ...        for the Petitioner.

               Mr. Pradip Paul         ...       for the State.



</pre><p id="p_2">                         Affidavit-of-service filed in Court today be kept

               with the record.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                         The material facts of the case are admitted

               and hence I have not called for affidavits.

</p><p id="p_4">                         The petitioner was the head teacher of a

               primary school and retired from service on January 31,

               2011.    The grievance of the petitioner is that the

               gratuity amount was disbursed only on April 2, 2012.

               He claims interest on the delayed payment of the

               gratuity amount.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                         It is now settled law that the gratuity amount

               is to be released to the retired/deceased employee

               immediately upon retirement/death. If there is a delay

               in releasing the gratuity amount, the retired employee is

               entitled to interest.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                         Various orders have been passed by this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                          2</span>


Court holding that the retired employee is to receive

interest on delayed payment of gratuity. Some of such

orders have been placed before me.
</p>
<p id="p_7">           Although the point of delay or limitation has

not been urged on behalf of the State, I deem it

appropriate   to   address   that   issue   briefly.   <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_1">The

Limitation Act</a> in terms does not apply to writ petitions.

The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of

India Versus Tarmen Singh reported in (2008) 8 SCC

648 has observed that if the issue relates to payment or

refixation of pay or pension, relief may be granted in

spite of delay as it does not affect the rights of third

parties.   It is settled law that the right of a retired

employee to get his retiral dues on the date of attaining

superannuation is a valuable right which accrues in his

favour on the date of his attaining superannuation.

Further, gratuity is no more considered to be a bounty

to be handed out by the State at its whim. An employee

has a right to receive gratuity upon retirement.        If

payment of such gratuity is delayed, the retired

employee is surely entitled to get some interest for such

delayed payment.
</p>
<p id="p_8">           The Rule that the High Court may not enquire
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                          3</span>


into belated and stale claim is not a Rule of Law, but

one of practice based on sound and proper exercise of

discretion. The principle on which the relief to a party

is denied on the ground of laches or delay is that the

right which have accrued to others by reason of delay in

approaching the Court should not be allowed to be

disturbed. In the present case, it was the bounden duty

of the State to disburse the gratuity amount on the due

date.   If it has failed to do so and has released such

amount after unexplained delay, it is obliged to pay

interest to the retired employee. This is compensatory

in   nature.   Pension    and   gratuity   are   aimed   at

maintaining the life of a retired employee and his/her

dependents, these are welfare provisions and even if

there is delay on the part of a retired employee to

approach the Court claiming interest on delayed

payment of gratuity, the delay per se should not be the

ground for rejection of the writ petition. No third party

interest will be affected by a direction on the State to

compensate the retired employee for delayed payment of

gratuity by paying interest at a reasonable rate.

</p><p id="p_9">          Having heard the learned counsel for the

parties and having regard to the orders of this Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                           4</span>


passed in other matters, I direct the Director of Pension,

Provident Fund and Group Insurance, Government of

West Bengal as also the concerned Treasury Officer to

pay interest to the petitioner at the rate of 9% per cent

per annum on the gratuity amount calculated from

February 1, 2011 till actual date of payment.

</p><p id="p_10">          Such payment is to be made within eight

weeks from the date of communication of the certified

copy of this order to the concerned authorities.

</p><p id="p_11">          Since   no   affidavit-in-opposition   has    been

invited, the allegations contained in the writ petition are

deemed not to be admitted.
</p>
<p id="p_12">          WP No. 17487        (W) of 2017 is, accordingly,

disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_13">          There will be no order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_14">          Urgent certified website copies of this order, if

applied for, be made available to the parties upon

compliance of the requisite formalities.
