THIS MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS APPEAL HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD
ON 17.10.2018, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY DELIVERED THE
FOLLOWING:
 MACA NO.938/2009

                                     2

<p id="p_1">            The appellant is the claimant who suffered an

accident     and    thereby    suffered           permanent     disability

also.      The accident occurred when the appellant was

riding a motor bike which was hit by an auto rickshaw.

Negligence    was    found     on    the     auto    driver     which   was

covered by a valid insurance policy.                 The appellant had

suffered     following      injuries        and    undergone     treatment

proceedings    as has       been noticed           by the     Tribunal in

Paragraph 6:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     Ext.A6    wound     certificate          issued     from    the

     Elite Mission Hospital, Thrissur shows that

     the petitioner was admitted there with left

     side     hemiparesis,          right     parietal      oedema,

     right    temporal       scalp       contusion,      lacerated

     wound    over    the     leg    exposing       muscles,     and

     investigation revealed fracture of the fibula

     and also fracture of right lateral condyle of

     right tibia.         The Ext.A6 discharge summary

     shows that the petitioner was in the hospital

     as inpatient for 61 days.                    He was diagnosed

     as a case of severe head injury involving

     temporoparietal lobe haematoma, fracture of

     right    temporal        bone,            fracture       of    right

     lateral orbital wall, fracture of the right

     fibula and fracture of lateral condyl of left

     tibia.        As    part       of       treatment     craniotomy

     evacuation of temporo parietal                     haematoma was

     done,      and      FTP        bone        flap      replacement

     craniplasty was done.               Ostcomyclitic FTP bone

     flap    removal      was    also         done     under       general

     anaesthesia        and    FTP    bone       flap    removal      was

     also    done.       The     Ext.A8          discharge         summary

     shows that the petitioner was again admitted

     in the hospital on 18.11.2004                        and he was

     there as inpatient for 14 days at that time.</blockquote><p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">     The     admission        was        right       fronto        temporo

       treatment acrylic cranioplasty was done."



</p><p id="p_4">             2. Exts.A1, A2, A3 and A11 were the disability

certificates produced by the appellant.              Ext.A2 was a

disability certificate issued for cognitive disability

and    A11   for   orthopedic   disability.    The   Doctors   who

issued such certificates were not examined before the

Tribunal.      The Tribunal rightly did not rely on the

said    certificates    to   grant   any   compensation.       With

respect to the       neurological disability as assessed by

PW1, the Tribunal took only 50% of the same.                   The

disability assessed was 5% for reason of apprehended

seizures and 5% for diminished sexual activity. The

appellant challenge the Tribunal's finding in having

taken 50% of the disability assessed, to compute               the

loss of future earnings, as not correct. This Court is

of the opinion         that the 5% disability suffered by

reason of diminishing sexual activity cannot be taken

for the purpose of       compensation for future employment

prospects, however, the same can be taken for making an

enhancement      for   loss     of    amenities       suffered   by   the

appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_5">          3. The next contention is with respect to the

income adopted. The appellant claimed to be a driver

and   asserted     a   salary    of       Rs.3500/-    per   month,   the

Tribunal adopted only Rs.2000/-.               The accident occurred

in the year 2004. In 2004,the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

Ramachandrappa v. The Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance

Insurance Company Ltd.           [(2011) AIR SC 2951] found a

coolie   to   have     monthly       income   of   Rs.4500/-.In       such

circumstances, the income as asserted by the appellant

can be granted. The appellant was aged 28 years at the

time of the accident, hence the following enhancement

can be granted.</p><pre id="pre_2">
