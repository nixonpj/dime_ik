                        best to persuade this Court to depict that it is a case of no

                        evidence as the girl was hardly four years at the time of

                        occurrence and gave her statement before the Court while she

                        was about six years old, inasmuch as, no substantive statement

                        has been made before the Police. It has also been submitted that

                        the F.I.R. has also been instituted after the long delay even after

                        the preparation of inquest report.

                        finding that it is not a fit case where we should exercise the

                        discretion in favour of the appellants to grant bail for the

                        present. Accordingly, the prayer for bail is rejected.
