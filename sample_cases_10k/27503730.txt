    Oral Judgment :

<p id="p_2">    1                  The   Petitioner/   MSRTC   is   aggrieved   by   the   judgment   and 

    order dated 04.11.1991 delivered by the Labour Court, Jalgaon by which 





    Complaint   (ULP)   No.98/1987   filed   by   the   Respondent/   Employee   has 

    been allowed and he has been granted reinstatement with continuity of 

    service and back-wages from the date of his acquittal. The Petitioner is 

    also aggrieved by the judgment of the Industrial Court dated 21.06.1996

    by which Revision (ULP) No.3/1996 has been rejected.

    interim relief, the payment of back-wages as granted by the Labour Court 

    was stayed.

    salary was restructured by taking into account all increments to which he 
                                  
    would   have   been   entitled   to   even   for   a   period   of   unemployment   from 
                                 
    08.06.1987 to 17.05.1993. The Respondent has now retired from service 

    upon attaining the age of superannuation on 31.07.2016.

    No.3578/2001, this Court noted that the  Respondent was reinstated in 





    service   pursuant   to   the   order   of   the   Labour   Court   on   17.05.1993   and 

    hence, the Petitioner was directed to fix his salary.
</p>




<p id="p_6">    5               There is no dispute that the Respondent, who was working as 

    a Driver with the Petitioner/ MSRTC, was involved in an accident of his 

    bus on 07.04.1986 resulting in the death of a boy aged four years. After 

    conducting a full fledged domestic enquiry, he was dismissed from service 

    on 08.06.1987. The Petitioner had joined employment of the Respondent

    in 1981. As such, he had put in only six years of service when he was 




                                                                                       
    dismissed. 
</p>



                                                               
<p id="p_7">    6               In Complaint (ULP) No.98/1987, the Respondent challenged 

    his dismissal. By the part-1 judgment dated 31.01.1991, the enquiry was 




                                                              
    upheld, but stood watered down owing to the conclusion of the Labour 

    Court that the findings of the Enquiry Officer are perverse. It is undisputed 




                                                 
    that though the Petitioner was given an opportunity of conducting a de-
</p>                                  
<p id="p_8">    novo   enquiry   for   proving   the   charges,   it   did   not   choose   to   lead   any 
                                 
    evidence and did not prove the charges against the Respondent. As is trite 

    law   that   in   such   circumstances,   no   charges   are   proved   against   the 

    delinquent. The revision petition of the Petitioner/ MSRTC has also been 
       
    



    rejected by the judgment dated 21.06.1996. I do not find any reason to 

    interfere with the said judgment since the charges were never proved by 





    the Petitioner/ MSRTC before the Labour Court.
</p>


<p id="p_9">    7               Shri Goyanka, learned Advocate for the Petitioner/ MSRTC, 





    has   strenuously   canvassed   that   the   Petitioner   is   in   financial   losses   and 

    would not be able to sustain the burden of back-wages. He further submits 

    that the principle of "no work- no pay" needs to be applied in this case so 

    as to deprive the Respondent of the back-wages for the period 08.06.1987 

    to 16.05.1993. He further submits that after reinstating the Respondent on 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">         ::: Uploaded on - 09/08/2016                          ::: Downloaded on - 10/08/2016 00:10:50 :::</span>

    17.05.1993, his pay structure was adjusted to include even the increments 




                                                                                       
    which he would have earned in between June, 1987 to May, 1993 and 

    therefore, all benefits have been given to the Respondent.
</p>



                                                               
<p id="p_10">    8               Shri   Patil,   learned   Advocate   for   the   Respondent,   has 




                                                              
    strenuously opposed the submissions of Shri Goyanka. He prays that back-
</p>
<p id="p_11">    wages should be paid to the Respondent. He may, at the most, waive the 




                                                 
    interest component.           
</p>                                 
<p id="p_12">    9               Shri Goyanka further submits that after the reinstatement of 

    the   Respondent,   he   has   not   indulged   in   any   accident   and   has 

    superannuated. All his legal dues would be paid to him as are permissible 
       
    



    by the service conditions and rules applicable.
</p>




<p id="p_13">    10              Insofar   as   the   back-wages   are   concerned,   it   cannot   be 

    disputed   that   the   Petitioner/   MSRTC   is   in   financial   losses.   It   is   also 

    undisputed that the Respondent had driven the bus on 07.04.1986 which 





    resulted in the death of a boy aged four years. The Petitioner/ MSRTC did 

    not   conduct   a   de-novo   enquiry   before   the   Labour   Court   to   prove   the 

    charge  and  hence,  under   fortuitous  circumstances,  the  Respondent  is a 

    beneficiary of this serious lapse on the part of the MSRTC.

<p id="p_15">    12              In   the   instant   case,   had   the   MSRTC   proved   the   charges

    different.   By   not   proving   the   charges,   the   Respondent   has   to   be 
                                  
    exonerated. As such, considering the peculiarity of the fact situation as 
                                 
    above, which is quite unusual, I am modifying the impugned judgment of 

    the Industrial Court by granting only 25% back-wages to the Respondent/ 

    Employee for the period from 08.06.1987 till 16.05.1993, which will be 
       
    



    calculated on the basis of his last drawn wages in the month of May, 1987.

<p id="p_16">    13              In the light of the above, this Writ Petition is partly allowed 

    and the impugned judgments of the Labour Court dated 04.11.1991 and 

    the Industrial Court dated 21.06.1996 are modified only to the extent of 





    grant of  back-wages, with a direction  to the  Petitioner/  MSRTC to pay
