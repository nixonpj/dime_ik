</blockquote><p id="p_27">      13.    ISSUE NO.1:-.        According to the petitioner on

04.06.2018 at about 4.30 A.M., he was proceeding in a car bearing

registration No.KA-01-MQ-6806 the same was driven by its driver

P V Goutham on Bangalore-Hyderabad National High way towards

Koduru at that time, the offending vehicle came in a rash and

negligent manner and dashed against the petitioner. Due to impact

the petitioner had sustained injuries.
</p>
<p id="p_28">      14.    It pertains to note that, the occurrence of the accident

involving the offending vehicle has been admitted. Therefore, there

is no dispute regarding the accident and involvement of the

offending vehicle. The controversy between the parties is on respect

of actionable negligence only.
</p>
<p id="p_29">      15.    In order to prove the rash and negligence of the

offending vehicle, the petitioner himself has been examined as PW-1

and got marked the documents as Ex.P1 to P16.              In his oral

evidence he reiterated and reformed the contention taken in the

plaint. In his deposition he deposed all the averments narrated in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                    8               MVC.No.4179/2018</span>

the petition.   In support of his oral evidence, he has also produced

the documentary evidence. Ex.P1 is the FIR reveals that, the

jurisdiction police, Chillamattur PSI had registered the case in Crime

No.37/2018 dated.14.06.2018 against the driver of the offending

vehicle for offence punishable U/sec.337 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>. Ex.P2 is the copy of

the complaint, since Ex.P2 is in Telugu language the petitioner has

produced translation copy of the complaint, which is marked as

Ex.P2a. Ex.P3 is the spot mahazar, since Ex.P3 is in Telugu

language the petitioner has produced translation copy of the

complaint, which is marked as Ex.P3a. Ex.P4 is the sketch. Ex.P5

is the IMV report. These are all police record reveal that, the said

accident was not caused due to any mechanical defect.        Ex.P6 is

the wound certificate reveals that, the petitioner has sustained

accidental injuries in the road traffic accident. Ex.P7 is the charge

sheet. On perusal of this document, it is noticed that, the accident

has happened on Bangalore-Hyderabad Road.         Further it is visible

from the sketch i.e., Ex.P4. It has come for the evidence of PW-1

that, at that time of accident he was going to Bangalore-Hyderabad

national high way towards Koduru and the offending vehicle was

coming from the opposite direction. From this evidence it is clear

that, the accident has happened due to rash and negligence manner

of the driver of the offending vehicle. Upon perusing all these police
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                    9                MVC.No.4179/2018</span>

documentary evidence, it appear that, immediately after the accident

the police have registered the case against the driver of the

offending vehicle. The investigation officer went to the spot drawn

spot mahazar and ultimately after completion of investigation he field

charge sheet against him on the ground that he was responsible for

the cause of accident. The respondents have failed to stepped in to

the witness box to rebut the evidence of the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_30">      16.   It must be noted that, inspite of sufficient opportunity

has been given to the respondent, he has failed to stepped into the

witness box.   It pertains to note that, the driver of the offending

vehicle is one of the best witness to speak about the accident, but

he is not examined by the insurance company for the reason known

to it. On the other hand, after the investigation the police have filed

charge sheet against him. But no contra materials are produced to

disbelieve the correctness of the charge sheet. Even though it is

short to be contended by respondent that, there was no fault of

driver of the offending vehicle, the same is not established before

the court by adducing either oral or documentary evidence. At least

the respondent would have taken steps to examine the driver of the

offending vehicle and non examination of the said driver gives raise

to draw an adverse inference against him to hold that, he alone was

responsible for the cause of the accident. Based on the oral and

documentary evidence I am of the opinion is that, the accident was

the result of negligent act of the driver of the offending vehicle. As a

result I answered this issue in the Affirmative.

</p><p id="p_31">      17.    ISSUE NO.2:         I already discussed in the above said

paragraph that, the petitioner had sustained injuries in the said

accident. According to him all injuries are grevious in nature. But

prima-facia Ex.P1 is the FIR discloses that, the case was registered

by the jurisdictional police for offence punishable U/sec.279 &amp; 337 of

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> only. On carefully gone though the Ex.P6 i.e., wound certificate

reveals that, he had sustained post traumatic head injury with right

FTP acte SDH-post craniotomy status. Further it revels that, at the

time of accident he was aged about 32 years and he was an

inpatient for a period of 3 days. Further the petitioner also produced

discharge summary as Ex.P8 issued at Navachethana hospital

Bengaluru, reveals that, the petitioner was admitted on 12.06.2018

and discharged on 19.06.2019 and he was diagnosed severe diffuse

actionable injury.   Further Ex.P6 reveals that, the injury No.1 is

grevious in nature and 2 and 3 are the simple in nature.

</p><p id="p_32">      18.    In addition to this, the petitioner had made an attempt to

examine other independent witnesses as PW-2 and 3. PW-2 is the

i.e., recent examination report, Neuro psychological report and CT

that, the petitioner had sustained grevious injury on his head and

face, the said injuries was due to the road traffic accident. Further

also stated that, the petitioner can not do his professional work as

earlier he was doing before he met with an accident. Ex.P8 is the

discharge summary discloses that, for these injuries he has taken

treatment as inpatient for a period of 3 days at Navachethana

hospital. Further, the petitioner has stated that, owing to accidental

injuries he has become permanently disabled and lost the earning

capacity. PW2 has stated in his evidence that, he did clinical

He is depressed not able to work presently. He has operated Neuro

31 years, working as medical record officer at Navachethana

hospital himself has been examined as PW-1 and produced

documents as Ex.P20 &amp; 21 i.e., authorization letter and case sheet.

In the cross examination he has clearly stated that, the police

intimation was not issued from the hospital

</p><p id="p_35">      20.     PW-2 has cross examined by the learned counsel for

petitioner at length. On perusal of cross examination of PW-2

reveals that, he is not treated doctor and the fractures are united.

Further he deposed that, he has sustained facial injury. Considering

the nature of the injuries and duration of the treatment, this tribunal

would like to take the disability to the whole body at 15%. Now, it is

to be seen whether the aforesaid disability in avocation of the

petitioner.   PW-1 in his evidence he deposed that, prior to the

accident he was stated to be hale and health, working as Operation

manager - F &amp; B Service at Olive Bar and Kitchen Pvt. Ltd., Palihill

Tourist Hotel No.14, Union Park Khar (West) Mumbai- 52,

Division-Olive Bistro, Hyderabad, earning a sum of Rs.79,276/- per

month. But after he met with an accident he submitted his

resignation to the company. It must be noted that, at the time of

accident he was working as consultant in the hospital. But no

document to establish that fact. It is to be noted that, PW-1 has

produced appointment letter as per Ex.P12 reveals that, he was joint

to service on 15.05.2013 in the said company and was drawing

salary of Rs.60,000/- per month. Ex.P13 is the form No.16 issued by

the Olive Bar &amp; Kitchen Pvt. Ltd., company from this document it can

be said that, PW-1 is the income tax assessee. Ex.P14 is the

relieving letter dated 13.09.2012 issued by the NB enterprises Pvt.

Ltd., reveals that, PW-1 was designated as Restaurant Manager,

worked in the F &amp; B Service department from 5th April 2010 to 12th

September 2012. It pertains to note that, the accident took place on

04.06.2018 but he relieved from the service on 13-09-2012 as per

Ex.P14. Thus, it is clear that, as on the date of the accident, he was

not in service at NB Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., company. Therefore, the

version of PW-1 that, he was working as Restaurant manager and

earning Rs.79,276/- can not be considered at all. Further, It must be

noted that, in order to prove his avocation and income, as on the

date of accident, no document is produced. Therefore, if the notional

income of Rs.11,000/- is taken, as the accident took place in the

year 2018 certainly it would meet the ends of justice. As could be

seen from the medical records. Ex.P9 is the Aadhar card, Ex.P10 is

the Election ID card, Ex.P11 is the pass post reveals that, as on the

date of the accident he was aged about 32 years. Hence multiplier

applicable to this case is 16. Thus the petitioner entitled is entitled

to Rs.3,16,800/- (Rs.11,000/- X 12 X 16 X 15/100) under the head

of loss of future income due to disability.
</p>
<p id="p_36">      21.    The medical     records shows that, the petitioner has

suffered injuries to head and for these injuries, he has taken

treatment as an inpatient for a period of 3 days in the hospital.

Certainly, he will have suffered paid and sufferings. Considering the

nature of the injuries, duration of treatment period, this tribunal is of

the opinion that, the petitioner is entitled for compensation of

Rs.30,000/- under the head of pain and sufferings.

</p><p id="p_37">      22.    Further, the petitioner has stated that, he was incurred

Rs.6,00,000/- towards medical conveyance, nourishment and other

accidental incidental charges etc., In order to establish this fact, he

has produced medical bills and prescriptions in Nos.56 and 13, they

are collectively marked as Ex.P15 and 16. These documents are not

disputed by the respondent. Therefore, the amount of Rs.6,42,085/-

can be awarded under the head of medical expenses.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                  15                MVC.No.4179/2018</span>

</p><p id="p_39">      23.   It pertains to note that, the age of the petitioner is 32

years, at the time of accident unfortunately he has suffered grevious

injuries. The evidence of PW-1 shows that, he has suffered the

permanent disability to extent of 15%. With this disability, he will

have lead his entire life. So therefore I deem it proper          and

necessary to award Rs.25,000/- under the head of loss of

amenities and happiness.
</p>
<p id="p_40">      24.   It is obvious from the evidence of PW-1 as well as

medical records reveals that, he admitted in the hospital on

12.06.2018 and discharged on 19.06.2018. So, he was admitted in

the hospital and taken treatment for a period of 3 days in the

Navachethana hospital. Probably, he would have taken rest to

recover from the injuries at least for a month. During this period, he

might have lost his income. Hence, if Rs.11,000/- is awarded

towards loss of income during the rest period it would be meet

the ends of justice.
</p>
<p id="p_41">      25.   Further, it is contended that, PW-1 might have spent

considerable amount for attendant charges and extra nutrition food.

Hence, I feel, it is just and proper to award a sum of Rs.3,000/-

under the head of attendant, nourishment and conveyance

charges.

</p><p id="p_44">      26.    The details of compensation which I have proposed to

award is as follows:

                                                        amount
    1. Loss of future income                        Rs. 3,16,800/-
    2. Pain and suffering                           Rs.    30,000/-
    3. Loss of amenities and happiness              Rs.    25,000/-
    4. Attendant charges, extra nutrition food      Rs.    3,000/-
       and conveyance charges
    5. Loss of income during the treatment          Rs.       11,000/-
       period and rest period
    6. Medical expenses                             Rs. 6,42,085/-
                        Total                       Rs 10,27,885/-


</pre><p id="p_45">      27. In all, the petitioner is entitled to Rs.10,27,885/-which is

rounded offence punishable to Rs.10,27,885/-.             In view of the

decision of the Hon'ble Supreme court reported in 2013 AIR

SCW 5375, he is entitled to interest at 9% per annum.

</p><p id="p_46">      28.    LIABILITY:      There is no dispute with regard to the

issuance of the insurance policy and its validity as on the date of

accident. The insurance company has contended that, at the time of

accident, the driver of the car did not have valid driving license.

</p><p id="p_47">      The burden to prove this aspect is upon the insurance

company. But, it has not examined the concerned RTO or the

investigating officer or produced the documents to prove its

contention. On the other hand, the charge sheet filed by the police

shows that, Sec.181 of IMV Act is not invoked. Considering this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                        17              MVC.No.4179/2018</span>

aspect, it is held that, the insurance company has failed to establish

that, the terms and conditions of the policy have been breached.

Therefore, the respondents are liable to pay the compensation to the

petitioner jointly and severally. However, the primary liability is on

the first respondent to pay the compensation. Hence, this issue is

answered partly in the affirmative.
