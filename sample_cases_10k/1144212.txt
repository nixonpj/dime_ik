ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_1">The
	petitioner detenu filed the present petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a>  of
	the Constitution of India, challenging his detention pursuant to the
	detention order dated 8.7.2010, which was executed on 9.7.2010,
	passed by the respondent No.2 - Police Commissioner, Ahmedabad
	City, by exercising the powers conferred under sub-section (2) of
	Section 3 of the Gujarat Prevention of Anti Social Activities Act,
	1985 ("PASA Act", for short). The petitioner is  branded
	as "bootlegger".
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_2">Heard
	Ms.J.C.Bhatt, learned Advocate for the petitioner and
	Mr.R.C.Kodekar, learned AGP for the respondents. Affidavit in reply 
	filed by respondent No.2 - Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad
	City has been taken into consideration.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_3">The
	petitioner came to be detained as "bootlegger" on his
	involvement in one offence arising under the Bombay Prohibition Act.
</p>	
	
	 


	  

<p id="p_4">It
	has been submitted by the learned Counsel for the petitioner that it
	is a settled legal position that on registration of one offence, no
	order of detention could have been passed, as petitioner -
	detenu cannot be branded as "bootlegger". It has been
	further submitted that the activities of the petitioner cannot be
	said to be injurious to the public health or public order. It has
	been further submitted by the learned Counsel for the petitioner
	that there is gross delay in passing the order of detention as well
	as there is gross delay in executing the order of detention.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_5">Per
	contra, Mr.R.C.Kodekar, learned AGP representing the respondents
	supported the detention order dated 8.7.2010 passed by respondent
	No.2 - Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad City and submitted
	that before passing the detention order, the detention authorities
	took into consideration all the relevant papers and after subjective
	satisfaction, the detention order is passed and thus the detention
	order is legal and proper and no interference in the said order is
	warranted and consequently the petition deserves dismissal.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_6">I
	have gone through the grounds of detention and considered the
	submissions advanced on behalf of both the sides. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_7">The
	Court is of the opinion that there is much substance in the
	arguments advanced by learned Counsel for the petitioner. It is seen
	from the grounds that a general statement has been made by the
	detaining authority that consuming liquor is injurious to health. In
	fact, a perusal of the order passed by the detaining authority shows
	that the grounds which are mentioned in the order are in reference
	to the situation of "law and order" and not "public
	order". Therefore, on this ground, the subjective satisfaction
	of the detaining authority is vitiated on account of non-application
	of mind and the impugned order, therefore, deserves to be quashed
	and set aside. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_8">Except
	the general statement, there is no material on record which shows
	that the petitioner - detenu is carrying on illegal activities
	of selling liquor or is engaged in such activity, which is harmful
	to the health of the public. In the case of ASHOKBHAI JIVRAJ @
	JIVABHAI SOLANKI v/s. POLICE COMMISSIONER, Surat, reported in 2001
	(1) GLH 393, having considered the decision of the Hon'ble Apex
	Court in the case of Ram manohar Lohia v/s. State of Bihar,
	reported in AIR 1966 SC 740, this Court held that the cases
	wherein the detention orders are passed on the basis of the
	statements of such witnesses fall under the maintenance of "law
	and order" and not "public Order".
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_9">Applying
	the ratio of the above decisions, it is clear that before passing an
	order of detention, the detaining authority must come to a definite
	findings that there is threat to the 'public order' and it is very
	clear that the present case would not fall within the category of
	threat to a public order. In that view of the matter, when the order
	of detention has been passed by the detaining authority without
	having adequate grounds for passing the said order, cannot be
	sustained and, therefore, it deserves to be quashed and set aside.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_10">In
	the result, this petition is allowed. The impugned order of
	detention dated 8.7.2010 passed by respondent No.2 - Police
	Commissioner, Ahmedabad City, is hereby quashed and set aside. The
	detenu is ordered to be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in
	any other case. Rule is made absolute accordingly. Direct service
	permitted.
</p>
