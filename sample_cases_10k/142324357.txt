      12.06.2014                           W.P. No. 16584 (W) of 2014
srm
                                              Jogamaya Bhowmik
                                                    -vs-
                                  The State of West Bengal &amp; Ors.


                   Mr. Balaram Datta                   ... for the Petitioner.

                   Ms. Tanusri Das                            ... for the State.


                               Let the affidavit-of-service filed today be kept

                   with the record.

                               This writ petition is filed by the writ petitioner

                   for a direction upon the respondent authorities to pay</pre>

<p id="p_1">                   interest on gratuity for belated payment of the same.

</p><p id="p_2">                               Having heard the learned Counsel appearing for the

                   respective parties and also considering the facts and circumstances of

                   the case, I find that the husband of the petitioner was a Head Clerk

                   Shyam Sukhi Balika Siksha Niketan, District-Malda and he died on

                   July 30, 2010 while he was in service.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                               The payment was made to the petitioner on the

                   basis of the Pension Payment Order on October 30, 2012.

</p><p id="p_4">                               The point of law, which is involved in this writ

                   application, has already been settled by a judgment

                   delivered by a Single Bench of this Court in W.P. 10750

                   (W) of 2007 on July 9, 2008 in the matter of Abha Acharya

</p><p id="p_5">                   -vs- State of West Bengal &amp; Others. In the above case the

                   petitioner was a primary school teacher and there was

                   delay in releasing his gratuity money. Operative portion of

                   the above decision is quoted below :
</p>
<p id="p_6">                        "Following the said Judgment and/or Order, I dispose of W.P. No.
                   1867 (W) of 2007 on 04.04.2008 and in other similar matters, I
                   observed that since the issue was similar, the Order that I had passed
                   in the said W.P. No. 1867 (W) of 2007 should govern those cases also.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                     2</span>


      However today when this huge pile of cases were heard, a
submission was made which was not made in the cases before me
referred to above, and which was to the effect that there cannot be any
adjudication on the question as to who was responsible for delay in
matters pertaining to payment of gratuity because the entitlement to
gratuity is automatic and is to be paid on the very day the person
retires.   Even the learned Advocate General did not dispute this
contention and very frankly and fairly stated that so far as the gratuity
is concerned, it has to be paid on the date the person retires with the
only exception that it can be withheld in cases where a departmental
action is pending against the concerned employee."


</p><p id="p_7">             On the basis of the above observation, direction was

given to the respondent authority to pay interest of gratuity at the rate

of 10% per annum. I do not find any reason for disagreeing with the

above decision. Accordingly, I direct the respondent authority to give

9% interest per annum on the gratuity amount paid to the petitioner

from the date when it was due and payable till the date of its actual

payment. Such payment shall be made within 90 days from the date

of communication of this order along with copy of this writ application

upon the Director of Pension, Provident Fund and Group Insurance,

Government of West Bengal as also the concerned Treasury Officer.

</p><p id="p_8">             It is further made clear that failure on the part

of the respondent authority to pay the aforesaid interest

within the stipulated time, an additional interest at the

rate of 2% per annum shall be paid to the petitioner.</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">             It is necessary to point out that the rate of

interest     is   fixed    at   9%    per      annum     taking     into

consideration the highest rate of interest payable by a

nationalised bank on fixed deposit.
</p>
<p id="p_11">             The    writ    petition,    is,   thus,    disposed     of.
</p>
<p id="p_12">However, there will be no order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_13">             Urgent photostat certified copy be supplied to the parties,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                      3</span>


if applied for, on priority basis.
