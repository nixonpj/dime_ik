RANJIT SINGH, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">             The petitioner and respondent No. 4 were elected as

member Panchayat of Gram Panchayat, Village Naushera, District

Gurdaspur. On 12.02.2009, Naib Tehsildar, Dinanagar conducted

demarcation proceedings and found respondent No. 4 to be in

unauthorised possession of panchayat land. On this basis,

respondent No. 4 was placed under suspension on 06.07.2009 and

regular inquiry was ordered. The regular inquiry found that

respondent No. 4 was in unauthorised possession of panchayat land

and report in this regard dated 22.02.2010 is annexed as Annexure
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Civil Writ Petition No. 11442 of 2011                           2</span>

P-1. On this basis, respondent No. 4 was removed from the post of

Sarpanch on 28.05.2010.
</p>
<p id="p_2">             Respondent No. 4 then filed an appeal but his appeal was

dismissed and order of his removal was upheld on 30.08.2010. Still,

direction was issued to get the matter inquired by Divisional Deputy

Director, Panchayat , Jalandhar , who was required to personally visit

the spot and submit his report to the Director. The petitioner would

contend that since the appeal of respondent No. 4 was otherwise

dismissed and his removal was upheld, the process to elect the new

Sarpanch was to commence and it was commenced. The petitioner,

thereafter, was elected as Sarpanch on 20.10.2010 by majority of

four out of six panches. On the basis of his election, notification was

issued on 15.12.2010 appointing the petitioner as Sarpanch.

</p><p id="p_3">             In the meantime, however, Kanungo conducted fresh

demarcation without associating the petitioner. The petitioner would

allege that the said Kanungo openly declared that he would give

report in favour of respondent No. 4. The petitioner submitted

representation that the earlier demarcation was conducted by the

Naib Tehsildar and his junior, Kanungo, should not be permitted to

conduct the demarcation. Still, the Kanungo submitted demarcation

report on 31.12.2010 and 12.01.2011. On the basis of this report

submitted by Kanungo, the Director issued notification reinstating

respondent No. 4 as Sarpanch on 03.02.2011.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             This order is passed without issuing any notice to the

petitioner, who in the meantime, had been elected as Sarpanch and

his election had also been notified. The petitioner filed an appeal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Civil Writ Petition No. 11442 of 2011                           3</span>

against the order of the Director but the same was not considered

and adjourned for long date. The petitioner approached this Court

and operation of the order passed by the Director reinstating

respondent No. 4 was stayed with the direction to the appellate

authority to decide the appeal of the petitioner. The appeal filed by

the petitioner has been rejected on 02.05.2011/24.06.2011. The

petitioner, thereafter, has filed present petition.

</p><p id="p_5">             Noticing these facts, this Court had issued notice of

motion and stayed the operation of impugned order (Annexure P-13).

When the case came up for hearing on 23.01.2012, the State

counsel made a submission that Divisional Deputy Director,

Panchayats, Jalandhar shall visit the spot on or before the next date

of hearing and would submit the report in regard to unauthorised

occupation of land by respondent No. 4. That report has now been

placed on record and indicates that respondent No. 4 has been found

to be in unauthorised possession of same land.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             Counsel appearing for respondent No. 4 today points out

that the copy of the report is not available with him. He, however,

orally submits that unauthorised possession of the land is shown to

be by son of respondent No. 4 and not by respondent No. 4. This

issue has to be resolved by the appellate authority.

</p><p id="p_7">             The earlier order passed by the appellate authority,

apparently, is not fairly passed. Once the election of new Sarpanch

was held certain civil rights have definitely accrued for the petitioner

as he was duly elected after the removal of earlier Sarpanch and this

election was even notified. Even if, some subsequent report has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Civil Writ Petition No. 11442 of 2011                            4</span>

shows that respondent No.4 was not in any unauthorised possession

of panchayat land then also the election of the petitioner could not

have been nullified in the manner it is done. The election of the

petitioner as Sarpanch was validly held and only when the removal of

the earlier Sarpanch had acquired finality. How could his removal be

set at naught by obtaining report from Kanungo that too when the

proceedings regarding his removal had been finally concluded. After

dismissal of the appeal, the Financial Commissioner would become

functus officio. Even if some procedure was to be adopted to de-

notify election of the petitioner or to re-notify the election of

respondent No.4, the petitioner deserved an opportunity of hearing.

The appellate authority, apparently, has failed to take into effect all

the factual position whereby the petitioner stood elected as Sarpanch

after adopting the due process. It is also not understood as to how

after rejecting the appeal, the appellate authority had earlier directed

the fresh demarcation of the land. The order passed by the appellate

authority would not appear appropriate. If he had any intention to get

fresh demarcation report and if there was none available as pleaded

by counsel for respondent No.           4, he should have waited for the

same and ought not to have disposed of the appeal instead of

rejecting the appeal and directing demarcation. In any event, that

may also remain academic now. Subsequent thereto, a fresh

demarcation has been got done by the State and that is done by an

officer of rank of Deputy Director. As per this report, respondent No.4

is found to be in unauthorized possession of panchayat land. If

respondent No. 4 wishes to dispute this factual position, he
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> Civil Writ Petition No. 11442 of 2011                             5</span>

perhaps has to challenge the demarcation report before the authority

concerned. It will not be appropriate for the writ court to go into this

disputed question of facts once this report has come pursuant to the

direction issued by this Court. The prayer of the counsel to file

objection to the demarcation report is, thus, rejected. The report was

for satisfaction of the Court to ascertain the position on the ground

and not for deciding this disputed question of facts.

</p><p id="p_8">              Accordingly, I would deem it appropriate to remand the

case to the appellate authority by setting aside the impugned order,

Annexure P-13 whereby the appeal of the petitioner has been

rejected without taking into account all the facts, as noticed above.

The appellate authority will now pass fresh order taking the factual

position in account and also taking into consideration and also the

effect of fresh demarcation and the demarcation report. The parties

would be at liberty to plead the aspect of demarcation and that of

unauthorized possession before the appellate authority.

</p><p id="p_9">             The present petition is, accordingly, disposed of.
