                    CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ADITYA KUMAR TRIVEDI
                    ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">03   11-01-2017                       Heard learned counsel for the petitioner as well as

                    learned Additional Public Prosecutor.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                      There was road robbery in which, the unknown

                    miscreants, after removing the informant, a driver, took away

                    vehicle whereupon products of Imami were being carried to

                    Motihari. From the case diary, it is evident that truck was seized

                    within the jurisdiction of Ahiyapur Police Station. It is also

                    evident that one Raj Kumar Sah was apprehended, who made

                    inculpatory extra-judicial confessional statement and the name of

                    petitioner along with others is found exposed therein with a

                    specific assertion that looted articles were sold to Krishna Sah as

                    well as Binod Sah. It is also evident from the case diary (Para-69)

                    that from the house of Krishna Sah looted articles were recovered.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.50604 of 2016 (03) dt.11-01-2017                      2</span>




             It is also evident from Para-77 that Binod Sah (petitioner) was

             apprehended and on his pointing out as per Para-78, looted articles

             in huge quantity have been seized. It is further evident that after

             completing investigation, chargesheet had already been submitted.

</p><p id="p_3">                              Contention on behalf of petitioner is that Krishna Sah

             and Raj Kumar Sah have already been granted bail. The case of

             the petitioner stood on similar footing. So, he be also enlarged on

             bail. The plea having been taken at the end of the petitioner like

             the plea taken by co-accused Krishna Sah is that, petitioner has got

             no information at the time of purchase that the articles were stolen

             property. However, from the confessional statement of Raj Kumar

             Sah as well as he himself, it is apparent that he had paid sufficient

             money and so, being a bonafide purchaser, petitioner is entitled for

             bail. It has also been submitted that petitioner has got no criminal

             antecedent and is under custody since 14.07.2016.

</p><p id="p_4">                              On the other hand, learned Additional Public

             Prosecutor opposed the prayer.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                              Considering the status of the petitioner on similar

             footing than that of Krishna Sah, who had already been granted

             bail vide Cr. Misc. No.40679 of 2016, petitioner, Binod Sah is

             directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of
