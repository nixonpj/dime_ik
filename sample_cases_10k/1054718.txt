<p id="p_1">Raman, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      This is an appeal against the interim order passed by the Prl. Sub

Court, Kottayam, in I.A. No. `1314/2007 in O.S. 181/2007, restraining

the appellant herein from inducting any strangers into the plaint

schedule property and house, from alienating the share of the plaintiffs

in the properties or    from committing any waste therein or from

changing the structure of the residential house situated in plaint

schedule property and from obstructing the plaintiffs from entering

into plaint schedule Items 1 to 3 properties.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      2.   The suit is one for partition and separate possession of 1/3rd

share in plaint item Nos. 1 to 3 properties and the building therein

along with improvements by metes and bounds with an alternative

prayer. A further prayer for a decree for permanent prohibitory

injunction against the 5th defendant is also sought for. Along with the

plaint, an application was filed for a temporary injunction for reliefs as

FAO 310/2007                        :2:
</p>
<p id="p_4">referred to above. The trial court, by a well considered order, after

adverting to the contentions between the parties, granted an injunction

as sought for. It is against the said injunction order that this appeal is

preferred.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      3. At the time of admission, the direction contained in the

impugned order, restraining the appellant herein from obstructing the

plaintiffs from entering into the plaint schedule property was stayed.

In other words, no stay was granted by this Court with regard to the

remaining portion of the order.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      4. Heard both sides. Since the suit itself is pending trial, the

point for consideration is as to the nature of the directions to be issued

so as to preserve the subject matter of the suit and to protect the

interest of both sides considering the balance of convenience. It is the

specific contention of the appellant herein that he is in possession of the

properties. However, this is disputed by the plaintiffs. The appellant is

the Power of Attorney Holder of defendants 1 to 4. For the purpose of

preserving the interest of both sides, the property in dispute shall not be

altered to the disadvantage of the plaintiffs. Hence the court below

rightly granted an injunction restraining the defendants from

alienating the property or creating any encumbrance thereon or from

FAO 310/2007                          :3:
</p>
<p id="p_7">changing the structure of the residential house situated in the plaint

schedule Item No.1 and also restraining them from committing any

waste thereon.         This would, in the normal course,         satisfy the

plaintiffs since status quo as on the date of the plaint will remain to be

continued until the disposal of the suit, by virtue of the direction so

issued.    However, the     further direction to the defendants not to

obstruct the plaintiffs from entering into plaint schedule Items 1 to 3,

in the absence of a prama facie finding as to who is in possession, may

not be justified.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       5.   In the circumstances, the order by which the appellant is

prevented from causing obstruction to the plaintiff to enter in to the

plaint schedule property is vacated. We do not think any other relief

could be granted in this appeal. The remaining directions contained in

the order impugned will be confirmed and will continue to be in force

till the disposal of the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       If the pleadings are completed and the case is ripe for trial, the

trial court shall expedite the trial of the suit itself.

</p><p id="p_10">       The appeal is disposed of as above.</p><pre id="pre_2">
