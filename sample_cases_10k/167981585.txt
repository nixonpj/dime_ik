RAJAN GUPTA J. (ORAL)

C.M. No. 26357-CII of 2010

            This is an application for condonation of 63 days in filing the

appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            Prayer has not been seriously opposed by learned counsel

representing respondent No. 3.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            For the reasons stated in the application, same is allowed.

Delay of 63 days in filing the appeal is condoned.

FAO No. 5926 of 2010

            The appellants have impugned the award passed by the

tribunal on the limited ground that as per judgment rendered in <a href="/doc/837924/" id="a_1">Sarla

Verma vs. Delhi</a> transport Corporation 2009 (6) SCC, 121, multiplier of

13 should have been applied considering the age of the mother at the

time of accident.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> FAO No. 5926 of 2010 (O&amp;M)                                              2</span><p id="p_5">




</p><p id="p_6">             Learned counsel for the appellants submits that age of

mother at the time of death of deceased Vipin Kumar was 48 years and

multiplier of 13 should have been applied and compensation be

calculated accordingly. He submits that he does not press his plea

regarding assessment of income of the deceased.

</p><p id="p_7">             Learned counsel appearing for respondent no. 3-insurance

company has opposed the plea.        He submits that average age of the

parents should be taken into account while applying the multiplier.

</p><p id="p_8">             I have heard learned counsel for the parties.

             In the accident which took place on 26.07.2008, Vipin

Kumar who was driving the motorcycle died as a result of being hit by

the offending vehicle. He was 24 years of age at that time. His legal

heirs preferred a claim petition.    Tribunal came to the conclusion that

death of Vinod Kumar has taken place as a result of rash and negligent

driving of the offending vehicle. After assessing income of deceased as

`7500/- per month and dependency of 50%, it applied a multiplier of 11

and arrived at a figure of `4,95,000/- as compensation. Another sum of

`20,000/- was awarded due to loss of estate and funeral expenses. Only

plea raised before this court is that keeping in view the age of mother of

deceased a multiplier of 13 should have been the appropriate multiplier.

I find merit in this plea. In view of law laid-down in Sarla Verma supra, 13

would   be      the   appropriate   multiplier.   Applying    this   multiplier

compensation is enhanced from `4,95,000/- to `5,85,000/-. The appeal

is allowed to this limited extend only. Rest of the amounts awarded as

compensation are maintained as such.
