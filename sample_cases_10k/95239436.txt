                       SUIT FOR RECOVERY OF RS.23,023/­

JUDGMENT:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">                     The present suit for recovery of Rs.23,023/­ has been filed by 



Suit No. 321/06                                                                                1 of 5
 the plaintiff against the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.                   Briefly stated, the case of the plaintiff is that the defendant is a 

contractor. In response to the tender of the defendant, vide agreement no. 

18/EE/CD­X­87­88,   the   defendant   was   awarded   the   work   of   making   a 

boundary wall at Nai Building, Janpath. The said work was to be started on 

27.09.1987 and was to be completed by 26.01.1988. However, due to slow 

progress   and   mismanagement   on   its   part,   the   defendant   had   delayed   the 

work.   Hence,   vide   letter   no.   EE/CD­X   no.   54/86/CD­X/AB/6575   dated 

17.02.1990, the Executive Engineer rescinded the work of the defendant and 

the   balance   work   was   executed   by   some   other   agency.   Due   to   non 

completion of the awarded work by the defendant within the stipulated time, 

the plaintiff had suffered financial losses. As per the agreement between the 

plaintiff and the defendant, vide letter no. 54(205)/CD­II/DCC­III/908 dated 

02.05.1995, the Superintendent Engineer, Delhi Central Circle­III levied a 

compensation of Rs.23,023/­ on the defendant on account of delay in work. 

However, the defendant has not paid/ deposited the said amount and the 

plaintiff is entitled to recover that amount from the defendant. It is further 

submitted that the plaintiff is also entitled for an interest @ 18% on the said 

amount. Hence, the present suit.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.                   On being served with the summons for settlement of issues, 

the defendant appeared and sought time to file written statement. However, 

despite opportunities given, the defendant failed to file the written statement 


Suit No. 321/06                                                                               2 of 5
 and vide order dated 01.05.2003, the defence of the defendant was struck off 

by my learned predecessor. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.                   Thereafter,   the   plaintiff   led   its   evidence   and   examined   Sh. 

Pradeep Gupta, Executive Engineer CD­II, CPWD as PW1.

</p><p id="p_5">5.                   Sh. Pradeep Gupta, PW1 deposed on the lines of the plaint and 

stated   that   vide   agreement   no.   18/EE/CD­X­87­88,   the   defendant   was 

awarded a work of making a boundary wall at Nai Building, Janpath. The 

copy of the said agreement was sought to be exhibited as Ex.PW1/1. (The 

same was not filed on record). He further deposed that the work was to be 

started on 27.09.1987 and the stipulated date of completion was 26.01.1988. 

Copy of the letter dated 17.09.1997 was sought to be exhibited as Ex.PW1/2. 

However, the same was not filed on record. He further deposed that the 

defendant had  delayed the work. The  plaintiff had complied  with  all the 

contractual obligations. He further deposed that the work was rescinded by 

the Executive Engineer vide letter dated 17.02.1990. The copy of the letter 

dated   17.02.1990   was  sought  to   be   exhibited   as   Ex.PW1/3.   However,  the 

same was also not filed on record. He further deposed that Superintendent 

Engineer, Delhi Central, Circle­III, vide letter dated 02.05.1995, had levied a 

compensation of Rs.23,023/­ on the defendant. The copy of the said letter 

was sought to be exhibited as Ex.PW1/4. However, the said letter was not 

filed on record. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.                   During his cross examination, he deposed that there was an 


Suit No. 321/06                                                                                  3 of 5
 arbitration between the parties and as regards clause 3 (a) (b) and (c), the 

arbitrator found that the delay was attributable to the plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_7">7.                   I have heard learned counsels for the parties and perused the 

record very carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.                   Now, the onus to prove its case is upon the plaintiff. The case 

of   the   plaintiff   is,   that   a   contract   was   awarded   to   the   defendant   which 

contained certain terms and conditions, the violation of which would entail 

penalty. The agreement between the parties in this regard i.e. the award of 

work containing the terms and conditions has not been produced before the 

court. When there is a document available with the plaintiff, withholding of 

that document from the court and merely orally stating, that the defendant 

was liable for penalty or that there was an agreement between the parties or 

that the work was awarded to the defendant, is not sufficient to prove these 

assertions. Even the fact that the penalty was imposed upon the defendant 

due   to   the   delays   was   required   to   be   proved.   It   is   not   merely   an   oral 

testimony which can prove such a fact. The circumstances have to be placed 

before the court. When and how the work was to be completed, what were 

the delays, what kind of notices were issued to the defendant and what were 

the   defendant's   replies   to   those   notices.   These   things   should   have   been 

proved before the court. Even the letter by which the alleged penalty was 

imposed has not been placed on record. Therefore, there is no evidence that 

any such penalty was imposed upon the defendant. In these circumstances, I 


Suit No. 321/06                                                                                4 of 5
 find that the plaintiff has failed to prove that there was an agreement which 

stipulated penalty or that the penalty was imposed upon the defendant or 

that the penalty was rightly imposed. In view of the same, I find that the 

plaintiff has failed to prove its case. The suit of the plaintiff is accordingly 

dismissed. Decree sheet be prepared accordingly. File be consigned to the 

record room.
