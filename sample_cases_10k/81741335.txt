<p id="p_13">5.     Considering the findings and observations of
the Apex Court in the case Gian Singh (supra) in
paragraphs 53, 54 and 57 read as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     "53. Quashing of offence or criminal proceedings on
     the ground of settlement between an offender and
     victim is not the same thing as compounding of
     offence. They are different and not interchangeable.
     Strictly speaking, the power of compounding of
     offences given to a court under <a href="/doc/895891/" id="a_3">Section 320</a> is
     materially different from the quashing of criminal
     proceedings by the High Court in exercise of its
     inherent jurisdiction. In compounding of offences,
     power of a criminal court is circumscribed by the
     provisions contained in <a href="/doc/895891/" id="a_4">Section 320</a> and the court is
     guided solely and squarely thereby while, on the
     other hand, the formation of opinion by the High
     Court for quashing a criminal offence or criminal
     proceeding or criminal complaint is guided by the
     material on record as to whether the ends of justice
     would justify such exercise of power although the
     ultimate consequence may be acquittal or dismissal of
     indictment.</blockquote>

<p id="p_14">     54.     Where  High   Court  quashes a   criminal
     proceeding having regard to the fact that dispute
     between the offender and victim has been settled



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  Page 5 of 12</span>
     R/CR.MA/22274/2018                       ORDER



although offences are not compoundable, it does so as
in its opinion, continuation of criminal proceedings
will be an exercise in futility and justice in the
case demands that the dispute between the parties is
put to an end and peace is restored; securing the
ends of justice being the ultimate guiding factor. No
doubt, crimes are acts which have harmful effect on
the public and consist in wrong doing that seriously
endangers and threatens well­being of society and it
is not safe to leave the crimedoer only because he
and the victim have settled the dispute amicably or
that the victim has been paid compensation, yet
certain crimes have been made compoundable in law,
with or without permission of the Court. In respect
of serious offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc;
or other offences of mental depravity under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> or
offences of moral turpitude under special statutes,
like <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_6">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> or the offences
committed by public servants while working in that
capacity, the settlement between offender and victim
can have no legal sanction at all. However, certain
offences which overwhelmingly and predominantly bear
civil flavour having arisen out of civil, mercantile,
commercial, financial, partnership or such like
transactions   or  the   offences   arising   out   of
matrimony, particularly relating to dowry, etc. or
the family dispute, where the wrong is basically to
victim and the offender and victim have settled all
disputes between them amicably, irrespective of the
fact   that  such   offences   have  not   been   made
compoundable, the High Court may within the framework
of its inherent power, quash the criminal proceeding
or criminal complaint or F.I.R if it is satisfied
that on the face of such settlement, there is hardly
any likelihood of offender being convicted and by not
quashing the criminal proceedings, justice shall be
casualty and ends of justice shall be defeated. The
above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. Each
case will depend on its own facts and no hard and
fast category can be prescribed.
</p>
<p id="p_15">57. The position that emerges from the above
discussion can be summarised thus: the power of the
High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR
or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction
is distinct and different from the power given to a
criminal court for compounding the offences under
<a href="/doc/895891/" id="a_7">Section 320</a> of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to
be exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                         Page 6 of 12</span>
     R/CR.MA/22274/2018                       ORDER



in such power viz; (i) to secure the ends of justice
or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.
In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding
or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the
offender and victim have settled their dispute would
depend on the facts and circumstances of each case
and no category can be prescribed. However, before
exercise of such power, the High Court must have due
regard to the nature and gravity of the crime.
Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or
offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be
fittingly quashed even though the victim or victim's
family and the offender have settled the dispute.
Such offences are not private in nature and have
serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise
between the victim and offender in relation to the
offences under special statutes like <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_8">Prevention of
Corruption Act</a> or the offences committed by public
servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot
provide   for  any   basis   for   quashing   criminal
proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal
cases having overwhelmingly and pre­dominatingly
civil flavour stand on different footing for the
purposes of quashing, particularly the offences
arising   from  commercial,   financial,   mercantile,
civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry,
etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is
basically private or personal in nature and the
parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this
category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise
between the offender and victim, the possibility of
conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of
criminal case would put accused to great oppression
and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused
to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full
and complete settlement and compromise with the
victim. In other words, the High Court must consider
whether it would be unfair or contrary to the
interest of justice to continue with the criminal
proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding
would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
settlement and compromise between the victim and
wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice,
it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end
and if the answer to the above question(s) is in
affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

         by public servants while working in that
         capacity,   the    settlement   between  the
         offender and the victim can have no legal
         sanction at all. However, certain offences

 which   overwhelmingly  and  predominantly
 bear civil flavor having arisen out of
 civil, mercantile, commercial, financial,
 partnership or such like transactions or
 the offences arising out of matrimony,
 particularly relating to dowry, etc. or
 the family dispute, where the wrong is
 basically to the victim and the offender
 and the victim have settled all disputes
 between them amicably, irrespective of the
 fact that such offences have not been made
 compoundable, the High Court may within
 the framework of its inherent power, quash
 the   criminal   proceeding  or   criminal
 complaint or FIR if it is satisfied that
 on the face of such settlement, there is
 hardly any likelihood of the offender
 being convicted and by not quashing the
 criminal proceedings, justice shall be
 casualty and ends of justice shall be
 defeated. The above list is illustrative
 and not exhaustive. Each case will depend
 on its own facts and no hard­and­fast
 category can be prescribed."
</p>
<p id="p_19"> 12.Thereafter, the Court summed up the
 legal position in the following words:
</p>
<p id="p_20"> "The position that emerges from the above
 discussion can be summarized thus: the
 power of the High Court in quashing a
 criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in
 exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
 distinct and different from the power
 given to a criminal court for compounding
 the offences under <a href="/doc/895891/" id="a_11">Section 320</a> of the
 Code. Inherent power is of wide plentitude
 with no statutory limitation but it has to
 be exercised in accord with the guidelines
 engrafted in such power viz.: (i) to
 secure the ends of justice, or (ii) to
 prevent abuse of the process of any court.
 In what cases power to quash the criminal
 proceeding or complaint or FIR may be
 exercised where the offender and the
 victim have settled their dispute would

 depend on the facts and circumstances of
 each   case    and    no   category   can   be
 prescribed. However, before exercise of
 such power, the High Court must have due
 regard to the nature and gravity of the
 crime. Heinous and serious offences of
 mental depravity or offences like murder,
 rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly
 quashed even though the victim or victim's
 family and the offender have settled the
 dispute. Such offences are not private in
 nature and have a serious impact on
 society. Similarly, any compromise between
 the victim and the offender in relation to
 the offences under special statutes like
 the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_12">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, or the
 offences committed by public servants
 while working in that capacity, etc.;
 cannot provide for any basis for quashing
 criminal     proceedings     involving    such
 offences. But the criminal cases having
 overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil
 flavor stand on a different footing for
 the purposes of quashing, particularly the
 offences      arising     from     commercial,
 financial, mercantile, civil, partnership
 or such like transactions or the offences
 arising out of matrimony relating to
 dowry, etc. or the family disputes where
 the wrong is basically private or personal
 in nature and the parties have resolved
 their entire dispute. In this category of
 cases, the High Court may quash the
 criminal proceedings if in its view,
 because of the compromise between the
 offender and the victim, the possibility
 of conviction is remote and bleak and
 continuation of the criminal case would
 put the accused to great oppression and
 prejudice and extreme injustice would be
 caused to him by not quashing the criminal
 case despite full and complete settlement
 and compromise with the victim. In other
 words,   the    High   Court   must   consider
 whether it would be unfair or contrary to
 the interest of justice to continue with


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                     Page 10 of 12</span>
 R/CR.MA/22274/2018                    ORDER



 the criminal proceeding or continuation of
 the criminal proceeding or continuation of
 the criminal proceeding would tantamount
 to abuse of process of law despite
 settlement and compromise between the
 victim and the wrongdoer and whether to
 secure   the  ends   of   justice,  it   is
 appropriate that the criminal case is put
 to an end and if the answer to the above
 question(s) is in the affirmative, the
 High Court shall be well within its
 jurisdiction   to   quash    the   criminal
 proceeding."
</p>
<p id="p_21"> 27.At this juncture, we would like also to
 add that the timing of settlement would
 also   play   a   crucial  role.    If   the
 settlement is arrived at immediately after
 the alleged commission of offence when the
 matter is still under investigation, the
 High Court may be somewhat liberal in
 accepting the settlement and quashing the
 proceedings/investigation. Of course, it
 would be after looking into the attendant
 circumstances as narrated in the previous
 para. Likewise, when challan is submitted
 but the charge has not been framed, the
 High Court may exercise its discretionary
 jurisdiction. However, at this stage, as
 mentioned above, since the report of the
 I.O. under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_13">Section 173</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_14">Cr.P.C</a>. is also
 placed before the Court it would become
 the bounding duty of the Court to go into
 the   said   report    and   the   evidence
 collected,    particularly    the    medical
 evidence relating to injury etc. sustained
 by the victim. This aspect, however, would
 be examined along with another important
 consideration,    namely,   in    view    of
 settlement between the parties, whether it
 would be unfair or contrary to interest of
 justice to continue with the criminal
 proceedings and whether possibility of
 conviction is remote and bleak. If the
 Court finds the answer to this question in
 affirmative, then also such a case would


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                     Page 11 of 12</span>
          R/CR.MA/22274/2018                                          ORDER



             be a fit case for the High Court to give
             its stamp of approval to the compromise
             arrived at between the parties, inasmuch
             as in such cases no useful purpose would
             be served in carrying out the criminal
             proceedings which in all likelihood would
             end in acquittal, in any case."

therefore,           no       purpose     is        likely   to    be    served
continuing the litigation. Therefore, the request
of the parties is acceded to.
