	Writ Petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India
praying for issuance of a Writ of Mandamus directing the respondent to

:ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">	This writ petition has been filed for a Writ of Mandamus directing the
respondent to provide drinking water connection to the petitioner's house in
Plot No.236 in S.No.189/1, New S.No.191/1 in Uppiliyapuram Village, Thuraiyur
Taluk, Trichy District, based upon the petitioner's representation dated
06.12.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2.The facts arising out of this writ petition are that the petitioner
purchased a plot in Plot No.236 in Old S.No.189/1, New S.No.191/1 in
Uppiliyapuram Village, Thuraiyur Taluk, Trichy District, on 18.02.2008 from
one V.Vijayaraghavan. Originally no order of approval was obtained for the
plot purchased by the petitioner, but the petitioner's vendor, before selling
the plot to the petitioner, paid a sum of     Rs.10,500/- for ratification
and for obtaining ?No Objection Certificate? on 19.12.2006 and thereafter ?No
Objection Certificate was also issued. The petitioner applied for building
plan approval to the respondent. But the same was rejected on the ground that
the petitioner's plot is situated in an unapproved layout. Subsequently, the
petitioner approached this Court by way of filing a writ petition in
W.P.(MD)No.15582 of 2014 and this Court by order dated 23.09.2014, quashed
the order passed by the respondent and consequently directed the petitioner
to submit a detailed representation to the respondent and directed the
respondent to consider the same within a period of four weeks. The petitioner
further states that she constructed a house in the said plot in the year 2013
and due to conversion of Panchayat as Town Panchayat there is a delay in
obtaining plan approval. Since the application of the petitioner was pending
for the past 5 years before its rejection, the petitioner constructed the
house, as it was deemed that her application was accepted. Now she could not
get the Electricity Service connection and water connection because of non-
consideration of plan approval. The petitioner has also sent a detailed
representation dated 06.12.2014 along with relevant documents, to the
respondent, but no fruitful result has been forthcoming. Hence she has come
up before this Court by way of filing the present writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3.Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and also the learned
Government Advocate, who took notice for the respondent.

petition is disposed of directing the respondent to consider the
representation of the petitioner dated 06.12.2014 on merits and in accordance
with law and pass appropriate orders after affording due opportunity to the
petitioner, within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy
of this order. No costs.
