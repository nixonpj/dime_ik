Heard On : January 27th, 2010.


Judgment On :                 22-02-2010.



</pre><p id="p_4">      Invoking <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the petitioner has

moved this application for quashing of a charge-sheet relating to an offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_2">Section 420</a> of the Indian Penal Code.

</p><p id="p_5">      2.     The grounds on which the prayer for quashing has been made are as

follows;
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          2</span><p id="p_6">


</p><p id="p_7">            (a)    The charge-sheeted materials do not satisfy the ingredients of

the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_3">Section 420</a> of the Indian Penal Code and the

remedy of the complainant lie in filing a suit for specific performance.

</p><p id="p_8">            (b)    There was no allegation of dishonest inducement.

</p><p id="p_9">            (c)    The   complainant    has    already   filed   a   suit   for   specific

performance of the agreement allegedly entered by and between the parties and

same is the foundation of the criminal case.
</p>
<p id="p_10">            (d)    On the same set of facts during the pendency of civil suit no

criminal proceeding is maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      3.    Now, having heard the learned advocates appearing on behalf of the

parties and considering the charge-sheeted materials, I find the prayer for

quashing has no leg to stand. Merely because an act has a civil profile that does

not sufficient to denude the act of its criminal outfit. The test is to see whether

from the materials collected by the police during investigation the offence has

been made out or not. At the same time, there is no immunity from a criminal

prosecution merely because on the same set of facts a civil suit is pending. It is

also no ground for quashing as one or two ingredients of an offence has not been

specifically mentioned in the FIR.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      4.    It appears from the charge-sheeted materials that the petitioner who

is the proprietor of Basanti Devi Nursing Home, Garia on the strength of an

agreement sometime in the first week of June, 2007 obtained a sum of Rs. 20

lakhs from the defacto-complainant on a false pretext of running the said

Nursing Home on a joint venture with him, but subsequently he neither
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           3</span>


registered the said agreement nor refunded the advance amount and has shifted

to some other place by shutting down his Nursing Home. During investigation it

has further been revealed that on February 6, 2005 the petitioner by keeping the

said Nursing Home, in mortgage, obtained a sum of Rs. 1.53 crores as loan from

State Bank of India, Alipore Commercial Branch.             As per the terms and

conditions of loan during the period of mortgage the petitioner was not entitled to

create any third party interest in respect thereof.     But the accused/petitioner

suppressing such facts of mortgage entered into an agreement with the defacto-

complainant for running the Nursing Home on joint venture and obtained a sum

of Rs. 20 lakhs from him and misappropriated the said amount of money. On

the face of such materials it cannot be said that no offence has been made out

against the present petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_13">            This is not a fit case for quashing of the charge-sheet. This criminal

revision has no merit and accordingly stands dismissed.

</p><p id="p_14">            In view of dismissal of the main criminal revisional application, the

application for extension of interim order being CRAN No. 54 of 2010 become

infructuous and accordingly stands disposed of.

</p><p id="p_15">            Criminal Section is directed to deliver urgent Photostat certified copy

of this Judgement to the parties, if applied for, as early as possible.
