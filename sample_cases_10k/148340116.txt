</pre><p id="p_1">Per: Rakesh Saksena, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.      Since both the aforesaid appeals arise out of the common impugned

judgment, this judgment shall govern the disposal of both the appeals.

</p><p id="p_3">2.      Appellants/accused have filed the present appeals against the judgment

dated 19th June 2001, passed by Special Judge [Scheduled Castes/<a href="/doc/25085007/" id="a_1">Scheduled

Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act</a>], Sagar, in Special Sessions Trial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                       2</span>

No.179/2000, convicting them under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code

and sentencing them to life imprisonment with fine of Rs.1000/-. In default of

payment of fine, further rigorous imprisonment for one month.

</p><p id="p_4">3.      In short, the prosecution case is that on 2.11.1999 at about 1.00 pm

complainant Munnibai (PW-1) alongwith her husband Haridas (deceased) had

gone from Khurai to Jaruakheda to fetch fuel woods. In the evening, they

were sitting at Platform No.2 of Jaruakheda Railway Station and were eating

food.    At that moment, accused Babulal and Mannu @ Manohar, who

happened to be the friends of accused Ramesh, reached there and threatened

Haridas that they will do away with him as he used to harass Ramesh. Both

the accused dragged him away by catching hold of his muffler. Munnibai tried

to save him, but Babulal Pushed her and accused Mannu dealt a knife blow in

the abdomen of Haridas. Babulal caught hold of the hands of Haridas from

behind and told Mannu that he should not remain alive, then Mannu dealt

several blows to him. He fell down smeared in blood. Munnibai shouted, but

nobody came to rescue him. She rushed to the office of Station Master and

informed him that Mannu and Babu had killed her husband. Station Master

asked her to lodge a report with the police. On getting intimation from Railway

Station, Jaruakheda, Sub Inspector of GRP, Sagar, K.D. Sharma (PW-16)

reached at the Railway Station and recorded Dehati Nalishi (Ex.P/1) on the

information given by Munnibai. According to her, accused Ramesh's nephew

Meharban had committed mischief with her daughter Babita due to which there

had been a quarrel.     A report was lodged against Meharban. Therefore,

Ramesh entertained grudge against her husband. Because of that animosity,

he got her husband killed by Babulal and Mannu.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.      Sub Inspector K.D. Sharma (PW-16) recorded Dehati Murg (Ex.P/2). On

the basis of Dehati Nalishi report and Dehati Murg, first information report
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         3</span>

(Ex.P/2) and Murg report (Ex.P/2) were registered.        Investigating Officer

M.S.Sikarwar (PW-22) conducted inquest proceedings in the presence of

witnesses and drew inquest memorandum (Ex.P/8). He sent the dead body to

Community Health Centre, Khurai for postmortem examination.

</p><p id="p_6">5.     Dr. B.S. Chauhan (PW-17) performed postmortem examination, vide his

report Ex.P/25 found 4 incised injuries on the body of deceased.        In his

opinion, the injuries were caused by some sharp edged and pointed object.

The deceased had died due to shock resulting from excessive haemorrhage.

</p><p id="p_7">6.     During investigation, on 7.11.1999 both the accused were arrested. On

the information of accused Manohar, a knife, clothes and a slipper were seized

from a place nearby spot. The seized articles were sent for examination to

Forensic Science Laboratory.     After completion of the investigation, charge

sheet was filed and the case was put up for trial.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.     During trial, accused persons abjured their guilt and pleaded false

implication.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.     Prosecution, to substantiate the accusation against the accused persons,

examined 22 witnesses. Though Munni (PW-1), Shri Ram (PW-6) and Shyam

Manohar Pathak (PW-7) were examined as eyewitnesses, but Shriram and

Shyam Manohar Pathak did not support the prosecution case.           However,

relying on the evidence of Munni (PW-1), finding it corroborated by the medical

evidence of Dr. B.S.Chauhan (PW-17) and other evidence on record, learned

trial judge convicted the appellants/accused on the charge under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_4">Section

302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_5">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code.        However, finding evidence insufficient

against accused Ramesh, acquitted him of the charge under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_6">Section 120-B</a> of

the Indian Penal Code.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.     Aggrieved by the impugned judgment, appellants have filed these

appeals.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         4</span><p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">10.   Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the evidence of sole

eyewitness Munnibai (PW-1) was not reliable.        She exaggerated in stating

before the Court that accused Babulal also dealt knife injuries to deceased.

According to her, the evidence of Munnibai was not corroborated by the other

evidence on record. In fact, she had disclosed the names of accused late. On

the other hand, learned Panel Lawyer for the State submitted that the

evidence of Munnibai (PW-1) was consistent, cogent and reliable.       It was

corroborated by the evidence of promptly lodged Dehati Nalishi, the evidence

of Station Master Dhyan Singh (PW-11) and by the medical evidence. He

supported the impugned judgment of conviction and urged that no

interference was called for in the conviction of accused.

</p><p id="p_13">11.   We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the

impugned judgment and evidence on record carefully.
</p>
<p id="p_14">12.   It has not been disputed by the accused that deceased died of a

homicidal death. Munnibai (PW-1), Babita (PW-2), the daughter of deceased,

and Tej Singh (PW-9) categorically stated that deceased died due to injuries

inflicted by the accused persons.      Sub Inspector M.S. Sikarwar (PW-22)

conducted inquest proceedings before Tej Singh (PW-9) and drew inquest

memorandum (Ex.P/8). In Ex.P/8 it was recorded that injuries by sharp edged

weapon were present on the body of deceased. It was found that he died due

to the said injuries.     Dr. B.S.Chauhan (PW-17) conducted postmortem

examination of his body. He found following injuries on his body:

</p><p id="p_15">          "(1)       Stab wound situated on left side abdomen 5 cm
          lateral to umbilicus. Size 3 cm x 1 cm. Both ends pointed.
          Margins clear cut. Depth of wound 4 cm. Wound track
          directed downwards and posteriorly entered into peritoneal
          cavity. Intestine ruptured.
</p>
<p id="p_16">          (2)      Incised wound situated on left thigh12 cm below
          from groin horizontally placed. Size 5 cm x 3 cm x muscle
          deep. Underneath muscles and blood vessels cut and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                        5</span>

          eechymoised.
</p>
<p id="p_17">          (3)      Superficial would on left buttock. 13 cm below
          from waist region vertically placed. Size 1 cm x 0.5 cm x
          skin deep. Both ends pointed.
</p>
<p id="p_18">          (4)       Incised wound on right thigh posterior aspect 12
          cm above from knee joint. Horizontally placed. Both ends
          pointed. Size 4 cm x 1 cm x skin deep.
</p>
<p id="p_19">          In the opinion of doctor Chauhan, all these injuries were
          ante-mortem and homicidal in nature. These injuries were
          caused by some sharp and pointed object. The cause of
          death of deceased was shock and haemorrhage as a result
          of injuries to body. He opined that all the injuries found on
          the body were cumulatively responsible for the death. The
          postmortem examination report (Ex.P/25) was written and
          signed by him."
</p>
<p id="p_20">
Thus, from the above evidence, it is clearly established that the deceased died

a homicidal death.
</p>
<p id="p_21">13.   Now the question before us is whether accused Babulal and Manohar

caused death of deceased.
</p>
<p id="p_22">14.   Complainant Munnibai (PW-1) stated that on the day of occurrence she

and her husband Haridas had gone from Khurai in a bus to pick up woods from

Jaruakheda. At about 7.00 O'clock in the evening, they came at Platform No.2

of Jaruakheda Railway Station and were taking their meals sitting on a bench.

Accused Babulal and Mannu reached near them and told as to why they

harassed Ramesh and that they will dispose them of.          Babulal pulled her

husband by catching his hands and Mannu pulled him by catching his muffler.

They then stabbed him. Mannu gave blow in his axilla whereas Babulal dealt

blow in his abdomen. When she tried to intervene, Mannu pushed and kicked

her. She went running to the office of Station Master, who told her that she

should go to police station. According to her, she told to Station Master that

Babulal and Mannu had killed her husband. She stated that she went to Police

Jaruakheda and lodged the report. Police people came at the Railway Station
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                         6</span>

and recorded her report (Ex.P/1) in the room of GRP. A Murg report (Ex.P/2)

was also recorded. According to her, Meharban, the nephew of co-accused

Ramesh had teased Babita whereupon a report was lodged. A case in that

regard was pending. Because of that enmity, Ramesh got her husband killed

at the hands of Babulal and Mannu. She categorically stated that she knew

both the accused persons from before. She denied that she saw accused

Mannu for the first time. Though she stated that there was no light in the

Railway Station, but she said that it was not so dark. In cross-examination,

she was confronted with her Dehati Nalishi (Ex.P/1) and the police statement

(Ex.D/1) wherein she did not disclose that accused Babulal also assaulted

deceased with knife. In Dehati Nalishi (Ex.P/1) this witness merely mentioned

that Babulal intimidated them and pulled her husband. When she tried to save

her husband, he pushed her. Her version in the report was that Babulal caught

hold of both the hands of deceased from behind and exhorted Mannu to kill

him whereupon Mannu dealt knife blows to deceased in quick succession as a

result of which he fell down dead. Improving upon this version, she in the

court stated that Babulal also assaulted deceased. It is true that she stated

that Babulal pulled the hands of deceased, but she admitted that Mannu

inflicted knife injuries to him. She further admitted that she did not see as to

from where Mannu took out knife. Both the accused persons ran away after

causing injuries to deceased leaving knife at the spot.

</p><p id="p_23">15.   Learned counsel for the appellants/accused submitted that in the

circumstances of the case since Munnibai happened to be the sole eyewitness

of the incident, she could not be held a wholly reliable witness. Since she

exaggerated in saying that accused Babulal also assaulted deceased with knife,

her evidence in this regard deserved to be discarded.
</p>
<p id="p_24">16.   Shriram (PW-6) and Shyam Manohar (PW-7) though admitted to be the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                        7</span>

eyewitnesses of the occurrence, but they did not support the prosecution case.

According to them, they saw a woman shouting that her husband was killed.

She was saying that Babulal killed her husband. However, this fact was found

to be an improvement. They did not mention this fact in their respective police

statements (Ex.P/5 and P/6).     Thus, their evidence, but for the fact that

husband of Munnibai was killed, rendered no support to her evidence.

</p><p id="p_25">17.   An important witness in the case is Dhyan Singh (PW-11), Station

Master of Railway Station, Jaruakheda. According to him, while he was on

duty, at about 7.20 pm a woman came shouting that her husband was

stabbed. She asked him as to where she should go, then he told her to go to

police station. According to him, woman was shouting that Babulal had killed

her husband. He stated that after about 10-15 minutes Sub Inspector Sharma

reached at the platform. When he and Inspector went at the platform, they

saw a person lying there dead and a knife also lying nearby him. According to

this witness, from his office he informed Assistant Station Master, Sagar, to

intimate about the incident to Police GRP.     Thereafter police force of GRP,

Sagar, reached the station. Though in paragraph-3 this witness stated that

Munnibai told to him that she knew only Babulal, but in next paragraph he

stated that he came to know that one was Babulal and other person was

Mannu later on. He stated that he recorded the incident in his daily diary

(Ex.P/10). In Ex.P/10 he recorded that later on woman told to him that Babulal

and Mannu, who belonged to Jaruakheda, had assaulted her husband.            He

stated that while in his office police officer was recording statement of woman,

she disclosed this fact to him. Since he heard woman saying the said fact, he

recorded it in Ex.P/10. In our opinion, since Dhyan Singh (PW-11) recorded

this fact in daily diary, it furnished corroboration to his evidence, which, in

turn, supported the evidence of Munnibai (PW-1).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                         8</span><p id="p_26">

</p><p id="p_27">18.      The evidence of Munnibai finds further corroboration from the evidence

of Dehati Nalishi (Ex.P/1) got recorded by her at 9.45 pm i.e. just after 2 hours

and 15 minutes of the occurrence wherein she mentioned the names of

accused persons. Sub Inspector K.D. Sharma (PW-16) stated that when he

was posted in GRP, Sagar, he received information from Railway Station,

Jaruakheda that a person had been stabbed to death. He went to Railway

Station, Jaruakheda and met Munnibai. She named two persons as assailants.

Thereupon he recorded Dehati Nalish (Ex.P/1). According to him, when he

received information on telephone that a person had been killed at Railway

Station,    Jaruakheda,    he   recorded    that   information   in   Rojnamcha

No.88/2.11.1999 and proceeded for the place of occurrence alongwith his

staff.     It is true that no names of assailants were mentioned in this

information, but it did not affect the credibility of the evidence of Munnibai,

because this intimation was sent by some unknown person in a cryptic

manner. K.D. Sharma (PW-16) firmly denied that Munnibai lodged any report

in Jaruakheda Police Chowki and that the said report was suppressed.

</p><p id="p_28">19.      Since other eyewitnesses viz. Shriram (PW-6) and Shyam Manohar

Pathak (PW-7) did not support the prosecution case in the trial court, Munnibai

(PW-1) occupied the status of a solitary eyewitness of the occurrence. It is well

settled that the evidence of a solitary witness must be of wholly reliable

category. Though it is not always necessary to seek corroboration from some

other evidence for placing reliance on the evidence of such a witness, yet in

the present case, the evidence of Munnibai (PW-1) finds corroboration from

the evidence of Dhyan Singh (PW-1), Dehati Nalishi (Ex.P/1) lodged by her

soon after the occurrence and the medical evidence of Dr.B.S. Chauhan

(PW-17), who found four injuries on the body of deceased caused by sharp

and pointed weapon. However, it seems that Munnibai (PW-1) improved upon
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                         9</span>

her version given in Dehati Nalishi (Ex.P/1) and her police statement (Ex.D/1)

in respect to accused Babulal in saying that he too stabbed deceased. The

original version as given by Munnibai (PW-1) in Dehati Nalishi was that Babulal

caught hold of the hands of deceased and it was accused Mannu who stabbed

him in quick succession. In the court, she stated that Babulal pulled the hands

of deceased and Mannu pulled his muffler. She did not say that Babulal kept

on holding the hands of deceased while Mannu dealt knife blows. It is also

significant to note that this witness admitted that she did not see from where

Mannu took out knife. This gives an indication that accused Mannu was not

holding the knife from before. As such, the probability that accused Babulal

had no knowledge that Mannu had a knife could not be ruled out. Therefore,

in our opinion, it was not established beyond doubt that accused Babulal

shared common intention with accused Mannu. As such, in our opinion, the

conviction of accused Babulal under <a href="/doc/25085007/" id="a_7">Section 302</a> with the aid of <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_8">Section 34</a> of

the Indian Penal Code was not justified.
</p>
<p id="p_29">20.   Evidence of Munnibai (PW-1) in respect of accused Mannu @ Manohar is

firm, cogent, consistent and reliable. It is established that he inflicted knife

blows to deceased in quick succession, as a result of which he died. According

to Dr. B.S. Chauhan (PW-17), the injuries found on the body of deceased were

sufficient to cause his death.     It can be inferred with certainty that when

accused Mannu inflicted four knife blows to deceased on various parts of his

body including abdomen, he intended to cause his death making him liable to

be convicted under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_9">Section 302</a> of the Indian Penal Code.
