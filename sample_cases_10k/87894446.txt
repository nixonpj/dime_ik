<p id="p_1">1.This petition is filed under S.482 of the Code of Criminal

  Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the Code) with a

  prayer to invoke the extraordinary inherent powers and to

  quash the pending criminal proceedings.

</p><p id="p_2">2.The petitioner is the accused in Crime No.1190 of 2016 of

  Ambalapuzha Police Station.      The said crime has been

  registered at the instance of the 2nd respondent alleging

  offences punishable under <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_1">sections 354(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_2">354(B)</a> of

  the IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.The prosecution allegation is that the petitioner, while

  working as ECG Technician in the Medical College at

  Vandanam, touched the body of the 2nd respondent with

  intent to outrage her modesty .
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.Heard the submissions advanced.
</p>
<p id="p_5"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Crl.M.C.8414/2016            2</span>

</p><p id="p_6">5.The learned counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent

  submits that it was on a misconception that Annexure-A1

  FIR was registered.    According to her, she is now fully

  convinced about the innocence of the petitioner and

  referring to the Annexure-A2 affidavit submits that she is

  not intending to prosecute him any further.

</p><p id="p_7">6.The learned Public Prosecutor after getting instructions

  has expressed his reservations in the matter of quashing

  the proceedings on the basis of settlement.         It is

  submitted that the invocation of powers under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_3">Section 482</a>

  of the Code in a case of this nature is not warranted.

  However, it is submitted that no other cases are reported

  against the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.I have considered the submissions .

</p><p id="p_9">8.In Gian singh v. State of Punjab (2012) 10 SCC 303

  Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the

  High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of

  disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl.M.C.8414/2016                  3</span>

  end to the criminal proceedings. It was observed as

  follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "61. In other words, the High Court
              must consider whether it would be
              unfair or contrary to the interest of
              justice to continue with the criminal
              proceedings or continuation of criminal
              proceedings     would    tantamount   to
              abuse    of  process    of  law  despite
              settlement and compromise between
              the victim and the wrongdoer and
              whether to secure the ends of justice,
              it is appropriate that criminal case is
              put to an end and if the answer to the
              above question(s) is in the affirmative,
              the High Court shall be well within its
              jurisdiction   to   quash  the  criminal
              proceedings."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">9.The aforesaid dictum stands reiterated by the Apex Court

  in Narinder singh v. State of Punjab. (2014) 6 SCC

  466, the pertinent observations which are as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                 XXXXXXXXXXXX

                 29.2.   When      the  parties  have
                 reached the settlement and on that
                 basis  petition   for  quashing  the
                 criminal proceedings is filed, the
                 guiding factor in such cases would
                 be to secure:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                 (i) ends of justice, or

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl.M.C.8414/2016                4</span>

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                 (ii) to prevent abuse of the process
                 of any court. While exercising the
                 power the High Court is to form an
                 opinion on either of the aforesaid
                 two objectives.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                 xxxxxxx

                 xxxxxxx



</blockquote><p id="p_11">10.The offence committed by the petitioner cannot be said

  to be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme

  mental depravity. The petitioner was working as an X Ray

  technician and it appears that the 2nd respondent felt

  offended when she approached the petitioner for taking a

  X-ray. On a consideration of the allegations, it also does

  not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious

  impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of

  proceedings on account of compromise would bring about

  peace and secure the ends of justice.        Even otherwise,

  persisting with the prosecution would be nothing but a

  waste of time as the prospects of conviction would be

  bleak.
</p>
<p id="p_12"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl.M.C.8414/2016              5</span>

</p><p id="p_13">11.Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of

  the considered view that this Court will be well justified in

  invoking its extra ordinary powers under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_4">Section 482</a> of

  the Code to quash the proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_14">  In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-

  A1 FIR in Crime No.1190 of 2016 of Ambalapuzha Police

  Station and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the

  petitioner are quashed.
