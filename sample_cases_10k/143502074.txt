Gurmukh Singh                                            --Petitioner

                         Versus

The Financial Commissioner, Rural Development
and Panchayats, Punjab and another                       --Respondents


CORAM:- HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE PERMOD KOHLI.

Present:-   Mr. Jaswinder Singh, Advocate for the petitioner.

            ***

<p id="p_1">PERMOD KOHLI.J (ORAL)

            The petitioner, a suspended sarpanch of the panchayat, has

challenged the order dated 28.5.2009 (Annexure P-7), whereby the

respondent no.2 placed the petitioner under suspension for alleged acts of

misconduct as also the order dated 6.7.2009 (Annexure P-9), whereby the

Appellate Authority while upholding the order of suspension has remanded

the case back.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            The petitioner was elected as sarpanch of village Khumna,

Tehsil Amloh, District Fatehgarh Sahib. He was served with a show cause

notice dated 20.2.2009 asking to send reply in regard to the allegations

levelled against him. He submitted his reply and was also asked to appear

in person as is admitted by the petitioner in para 12 of the writ petition.

After hearing the petitioner and considering the reply to show cause notice

the respondent no.2 vide his order dated 28.5.2009 placed the petitioner

under suspension while recommending the disciplinary action against him.

It is specifically mentioned in the impugned order that a copy of the inquiry
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> CWP. No. 11141 of 2009                             -2-</span>

report on the basis of which the action has been initiated was furnished to

the petitioner and he was also issued a show cause notice to which the

petitioner had replied. On consideration of the reply and after hearing the

petitioner, the order of his suspension has been passed under Section 20(4)

of the Punjab Panchayati Raj Act.          The aforesaid order came to be

challenged by the petitioner in appeal before respondent no.1, who has

upheld the order. However, on the contention of the petitioner that the

show cause notice was served after passing of the order by respondent no.2,

respondent no.1 remanded the case back to the Director to consider this

aspect of the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has vehemently

argued that it was not open to respondent no.1 to uphold the order when the

case was remanded back.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             After perusing the order of the Appellate Authority it appears

that the only ground for remanding the case back is that the show cause

notice was served upon the petitioner after the passing of the order. It

appears that this contention was made orally before respondent no.1. From

the memo of appeal, it appears that no such contention was raised before

respondent no.1.        It appears that the petitioner misrepresented before

respondent no.1 that show cause notice was served upon him after passing

of the order which fact does not seem to be correct as is evident from the

order passed by respondent no.2, wherein, it was specifically mentioned that

show cause notice was issued to the petitioner. It is clearly established that

the show cause notice was served before passing of the impugned order. As

a matter of fact respondent no.1 should not have remanded the case back at

all.

</p><p id="p_6">              Learned counsel for the petitioner has further tried to impress

upon the Court that the allegations against the petitioner have not been

proved.     Suffice it to say that respondent no.2 prima facie found the

allegations to have been proved on the basis of the inquiry. The detailed

inquiry is yet to be conducted against the petitioner. At this stage the prima

facie opinion is sufficient to place the petitioner under suspension. I do not

find any any valid ground to interfere in the impugned order. Petition

dismissed.
