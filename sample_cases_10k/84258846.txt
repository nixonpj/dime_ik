</p><p id="p_5">                            3. We have heard learned counsel for petitioner and learned

                      Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for respondents. We have also

                      perused the records produced by the Detaining Authority.




</p><p id="p_6">                            4. Though several grounds have been raised in the Habeas Corpus

                      Petition, learned counsel for petitioner would mainly focus his argument on

                      the ground that there is gross violation of procedural safeguards, which

                      would vitiate the detention. The learned counsel, by placing authorities,

                      submitted that the representation made by the petitioner was not

                      considered on time and there was an inordinate and unexplained delay. In

                      support of his contention, learned counsel for petitioner relied on the

                      judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/186083145/" id="a_13">Rajammal vs. State of

                      the representation, on that score alone, the impugned detention order

                      cannot be quashed. According to the learned Additional Public Prosecutor,

                      no prejudice has been caused to the detenu and thus, there is no violation

                      of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 21 and 22 of the

                      Constitution of India.

<p id="p_9">


</p><p id="p_10">                            6. The Detention Order in question was passed on 20.06.2018. The

                      petitioner made a representation, dated 23.07.2018 and the same was

                      received on 24.07.2018.     Thereafter, remarks were called for by the

                      Government from the Detaining Authority on 25.07.2018. The remarks were

                      duly received on 30.07.2018. Thereafter, the Government considered the

                      matter and passed the order rejecting the petitioner's representation on

                      10.08.2018 and served on the detenu on 13.08.2018.




</p><p id="p_11">                            7. It is the contention of the petitioner that there was an inordinate

                      delay of 4 days in submitting the remarks by the Detaining Authority, of

                      which 2 days were Saturday and Sunday and hence there was a delay of 2

                      days in submitting the remarks. Thereafter, there was yet another delay of

                      7 days in considering the representation, of which 2 days were Saturdays,

                      Sundays and Government Holidays and hence there was yet another delay of

                      5 days in considering representation.

                      the Honourable Supreme Court has held that the procedural safeguards are

                      required to be zealously watched and enforced by the Courts of law and

                      their rigour cannot be allowed to be diluted on the basis of the nature of

                      the alleged activities undertaken by the detenu.

                      (2) MWN     (Cr.) 145, a Division Bench of this Court has held that the

                      unexplained delay of three days in disposal of the representation made on

                      behalf of the detenu would be sufficient to set aside the order of detention.

                      inordinate and unexplained delay on the part of the Government in

                      considering the representation renders the very detention illegal.




</p><p id="p_16">                            11. In the subject case, admittedly, there is an inordinate and

                      unexplained delay of 2 days in submitting the remarks by the Detaining

                      Authority and 5 days in considering the representation.       The impugned

                      detention order is, therefore, liable to be quashed.

                      second respondent is set aside. The detenu, namely Seeman, son of Kannan,

                      detention is required in connection with any other case.
