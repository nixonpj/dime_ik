                              ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Petitioner   herein    has     come   up    before   thi     Court

impugning the order dated 30.8.2011 passed by the Office

Manager- cum-Secretarv, Gulbarga Mahanagara Palike,



</p><p id="p_2">      2. Brief facts leading to this petition are as under

      Petitioner herein is a tenant of Darga Hazrath Khaja

Bande Nawaz, Gubarga. It is not in dispute that he is tenant in

respect of shop Nos,9, 10 and 11 constructed by said Darga in

front of its hospital building.     It is also not in dispute that said

lease is in existence from   5t11   October 2001 till this date.    It is

seen that Corporation of City of Gulbarga by its communication

dated 18.5.2011 clarified that to ease the movement of drain
 S                                      -3-
</p><p id="p_3">    e




        water the existing storm water drain Is required to be

        strengthened with a parallel drain going along with existing line.


</p><p id="p_4">              3. In that behalf, to prevent stagnation in front of KBN

        hospital the culvert on the main road near said shop adjacent to

        KBN I-Iospftal was required to be reconstructed. When such a

        communication was made to the secretary of 3's' respondent

        herein, petitioner filed W.P.No 83085/2011 contendnw that if

        such a dram is required to be constructed, the same 1ll bc

        ronstrucied demollshmg his shop bearing Nos.9. 10 and 1! and

        therefore, he should be given an opportunity of bemg heard m

        an appeal to be filed under SectIon 444 of the Karnataka

        Municipal Corporation Act. 1976. Accordingly. writ petition was

        allowed with certain observations as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                    ffi the light
                                   of the submission of the
              learned counsel for the parties, as stated above.
              the writ   petition filed by petitioner stands
              disposed of. permitting the petitioner to submit
              the memorandum of appeal papers before the
              Office Manager cum Council Secretazy of the
              Standing Committee. City Corporation, Gulbarga,
              within two day% from today who in turn shall
              receive the same and pass appropriate orders in
              accordancc with law and dispose of the same."
</blockquote><p id="p_5">       4. It is seen thereafter a representation was made by

petitioner to    5t   respondent. In terms of the observations made

by this Court in earlier writ petition.         5th   respondent was

required   to    place    the   appeal   memo   before   the   stai-iding

committee.       Instead, he has assumed        the role of standing

committee and has disposed of the said appeal by order dated

3O.82Ol i. Annexure-D to writ petition. which is impugned in

this petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">      5. Heard the counsel for petitioner and the counsel for

standing committee, Government and Corporation. After hearing

the counsel for parties and going through the material on record

it is clearly seen that there is an error committed by                511



respondent in defying the order of this court referred to above.

When there is a specific direction to him to receive the appeal

memo and to place it before the standing committee, with

impudence he has assumed the charge of committee by himself

and has passed the order which shows the impudence with

which he has flaunted the order of this Court for which suitable

action is required to be taken. for which a separate order will

follow subsequently.

</p><p id="p_9">       6. As could be seen, the order of this Court is not properly

complied with, inasmuch as. standing committee                       1101   hearing
the appeal as directed by this Court.                  In that view of matter,
Annexure-D passed by               5th    respondent is set aside and the

matter is       referred back to             standing committee of City

Corporation. Gulbarga. which should hear this matter within 10

days from the date of receipt of this order


</p><p id="p_10">       7. So far as     5th   respondent who has flaunted the order of

this Court with total impudence is required to be dealt 1th

severely by the Commissioner of City Corporation, Gulbarga by

issuing show cause notice on him. holding an enquiry for not

complying with the orders of this Court and also impose suitable

penalty on him in this regard. After completion of such enquiry

and   Imposition   of   penalty, the same shall be informed to this

Court within three weeks           from the date of     receipt   of this order.




</p><p id="p_11">       8. Accordingly. the writ petition is disposed of.


</p><p id="p_12">       9.   A   copy    of    this       order   is   marked   to    the    learned
