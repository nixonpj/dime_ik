<p id="p_27">CONTENTIONS OF COUNSEL FOR PETITIONERS


</p><p id="p_28">22.    It is the contention of the Sri P.Venugopal, Senior Counsel,

Sri T.Venkat Reddy, Sri C.Ramachandra Raju, Sri Prabhakar

Chikkudu, Sri Penjuri Venugopal, Smt. Rachna Reddy and other

counsel, who appeared for the petitioners in this batch of cases that

the State Government and the State Election Commission were fully

aware that the term of office of the Members and Sarpanchs of the

Gram Panchayats in the State of Telangana would expire on

01-08-2018, but the process was not initiated to conduct elections in

the State before the said date, and without assigning any reason, the

impugned Government Orders were issued by it appointing

Government employees as Special Officers invoking sub-Section (3)

of <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_13">Section 136</a> of the Act without even specifying when it intends to

hold elections to the posts of Members and Sarpanchs in the Gram

Panchayats in the State. According to them, the State cannot decide or

withhold elections to Gram panchayats as per it's whims and fancies.


</p><p id="p_29">23.    They contend that this action of the State in not holding

elections before 1.8.2018 when the terms of the Members and

Sarpanchs of Gram Panchayats ended, and it's lack of any interest/

initiative to hold elections in the near future, violates <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_14">Article 14</a> of the

Constitution of India.

</pre><p id="p_30">24.   They contend that the State Government cannot take advantage

of its own wrong in not initiating steps for conduct of elections to the

Gram Panchayats much before the expiry of their term, and it cannot

be allowed to run the administration in Gram Panchayats through

State Government employees, who are under its thumb, and who will

do as per the bidding of the State, after expiry of the term of

Sarpanchs.
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">25.    According to the Counsel for petitioners, Gram Panchayats

have to work as vibrant democratic units of self-government as per the

Constitution of India and by willfully failing to hold regular elections,

the State cannot defeat this constitutional purpose by running them

through nominated persons under its control.


</p><p id="p_33">26.   They place reliance on <a href="/doc/1058223/" id="a_15">Article 243-E</a> of the Constitution of

India contained in Part-IX         of the Constitution introduced by

Constitution (73rd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_16">Amendment) Act</a>, 1992 and contend that it is

mandatory for the State to complete an election to constitute a

Panchayat before the expiry of its duration of five years, and the State

cannot sit idly till the term expires, and then appoint its employees as

Special Officers for an indefinite period of time and thereby violate

the democratic spirit of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><p id="p_35">27.   According to the petitioners, Part IX of the Constitution dealing

with Panchayats does not envisage appointment of Special Officers at

all, and any provision to that effect in the Act, is therefore not valid.

of the 2018 Act would apply only in a situation where a local area is

notified as a village for the first time and does not extend to already

Government Orders as well as the preceding Memo dt.13-07-2018 of

the State Government are without jurisdiction.

any reasons for appointing Special Officers, which the said provision

itself requires, they cannot be sustained and have to be set aside.

State cannot exercise power under <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_19">Section 136</a> of the Act for ulterior

purposes since it is only a trustee of the power conferred on it and is

bound to exercise such power reasonably, fairly and in a

Government Orders in exercise of power purportedly under <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_20">Section

cannot be allowed to control the administration in the Gram

allow its nominees to run the administration of the Gram Panchayats.


</p><p id="p_41">32.    Learned counsel state that by not conducting elections, the

State created a vacuum in the administration of Gram Panchayats and

thus committed a Constitutional impropriety and further also

committed another wrong, by filling up the vacuum with its

employees. The State, according to them, has to maintain status quo

prevailing as on the date of expiry of the term of the Gram Panchayats

and continue the ex-Sarpanchs as persons-in-charge till elections are

held because the Act does not disqualify the ex-Sarpanchs from being

appointed as persons-in-charge after the term expires.

aware of the difficulties of the people in the Gram Panchayat, and

they ought to have been allowed to run the administration, even

without any cheque signing power, till the elections are held in

accordance with law. They contend that in the interest of fairness and

equity, the State should choose them to run the administration of the

Gram Panchayats till the elections are held.


</p><p id="p_43">34.   They also contend that the Special Officers appointed by the

State have no administrative experience or knowledge of the day-to-

day affairs of the Gram Panchayats, that they are not able to spare

time for attending to their additional responsibility as Special Officers,

Societies in the State of Telangana, when the terms of their Managing

Committees expired, the State Government had issued G.O.Ms.No.12

case of societies where Managing Committees were performing

Prime Minister when Parliament is dissolved pending holding of

elections, and a care taker Chief Minister when the State Legislatures

are dissolved pending holding of elections, there can also be a care

taker Sarpanch/person-in-charge for a Gram Panchayat.

Government Departments and Agencies, that the Supreme Court had

directed not to use teaching staff on working days to avoid hampering

of studies of students, and therefore services of all Government

employees, agencies and volunteers should be utilized in this work on

Government as per <a href="/doc/220452/" id="a_32">Sections 9</a> and <a href="/doc/1453641/" id="a_33">17</a> of the Act. It is stated that the

No.363/TSEC-PR/2018 dt.20-06-2018 to finalize the reservations and

Point (a):


</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_17">61.     The main contention advanced by the learned Government

Pleader for Panchayat Raj is that the question about the

inability/failure of the State of Telangana to conduct elections to the

Gram Panchayats before 01-08-2018 does not arise for consideration

in this batch of Writ Petitions and therefore cannot be gone into by

this Court.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">
</blockquote><p id="p_83">62.     The counsel for the Writ Petitioners refuted the said contention.

In para-10 of the affidavit filed in support of W.P.No.27789 of 2018, a

specific contention is raised by the petitioner therein that under the

Constitution, there is a Constitutional obligation cast on the State to

conduct elections well within the time and that the State of Telangana

failed to do so. Reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/452231/" id="a_37">Article 243</a> E (3) (a) in support

of the said plea.
</p>
<p id="p_84">
</p><p id="p_85">63.     In W.P.No.28007 of 2018 also, in para-13 of the affidavit filed

by petitioners, it is alleged that there is a duty cast on the State to

conduct the elections six months advance, but it has slept over the

matter. It is also alleged that failure of the State to conduct elections

cannot enable the State to issue the impugned G.Os.


</p><p id="p_86">64.     Identical plea is also raised in para-12 of W.P.No.28625 of

2018.
</p>
<p id="p_87">
</p><p id="p_88">65.     In para-4 of the affidavit in W.P.No.31605 of 2018 also, it is

alleged that the State of Telangana and the State Election Commission
                                  ::23::                            MSR,J
                                                            wp_27036_2018
                                                                 and batch




failed to discharge their duty to carry out the constitutional mandate

under <a href="/doc/452231/" id="a_38">Article 243</a> E to conduct elections to Gram Panchayats before

the expiry of the term.
</p>
<p id="p_89">
</p><p id="p_90">66.   Thus, the question of failure of the State Government and the

State Election Commission of the State of Telangana to hold elections

to the Members and Sarpanchs of Gram Panchayats in the said State,

has been specifically raised by the petitioners and in W.P.No.27036 of

2018 a direction was also sought to direct conduct of elections as soon

as possible.
</p>
<p id="p_91">
</p><p id="p_92">67.   It is not in dispute that inability/failure by the State Government

and the State Election Commission to hold elections to Gram

Panchayats before the expiry of the term of their Sarpanchs and

Members, is the reason for appointment of Special Officers under the

impugned G.Os.
</p>
<p id="p_93">
</p><p id="p_94">68.   So, in my opinion, the issue of appointment of Special Officers

to the Gram Panchayats after 01-08-2018 under the impugned

Government Orders issued by the State of Telangana is intrinsically

linked with its failure and also the failure of the State Election

Commission to hold elections before the expiry of the term of

Members and Sarpanchs of Gram Panchayats on 01-08-2018.


</p><p id="p_95">69.   Therefore, the question whether the State Government and the

State Election Commission had a genuine cause for not holding

elections to the Gram Panchayats in the State of Telangana before
                                  ::24::                            MSR,J

                                                                 and batch




01-08-2018 is also required to be gone into while adjudicating these

Writ Petitions. Point (a) is answered accordingly in favour of the Writ

Petitioners and against the State of Telangana.


Point (b):
</p>
<p id="p_96">
</p><p id="p_97">70.    Now I will consider the question whether there is a duty cast

upon the State Government/State Election Commission to hold

elections to Gram Panchayats in the State of Telangana before expiry

of their term.
</p>
<p id="p_98">
</p><p id="p_99">71.    Though Panchayat Raj institutions had been in existence for a

long time, they had not been able to acquire the status and dignity of

viable and responsive people's bodies due to a number of reasons

including absence of regular elections, prolonged supersession,

insufficient representation of weaker sections like Scheduled Castes,

Scheduled Tribes and Women, inadequate devolution of powers and

lack of financial resources.
</p>
<p id="p_100">
</p><p id="p_101">72.     <a href="/doc/1714884/" id="a_39">Article 40</a> of the Constitution enshrines a Directive Principle of

State policy that the State shall take steps to organize village

Panchayats and endow them with such powers and authority as may

be necessary to enable them to function as units of self government.


</p><p id="p_102">73.    With this object and for the aforesaid reason, the Constitution

(73rd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_40">Amendment) Act</a>, 1992 was passed by the Parliament.

Parliament felt that 'there is an imperative need to enshrine in the

Constitution certain basic and essential features of Panchayat Raj

                                                                                and batch




institutions to impart certainty, continuity and strength to them'.

Part-IX thus came to be introduced in the Constitution of India with

the underlying purpose to create "democratic decentralization" for

ensuring that traditionally marginalized groups should progressively

gain foothold in local self government6.

</p><p id="p_110">77.   In the year 1995, in an unreported decision dt.12-08-1997 in

W.P.(Civil).No.719 of 1995, the Supreme Court held that various

clauses of <a href="/doc/452231/" id="a_48">Article 243</a> are to be followed in letter and spirit; the

concerned States cannot be permitted to withhold elections of

Panchayats except in case of genuine supervening difficulties to hold

such elections e.g., unforeseen natural calamities in the State like

flood, earthquake etc. or extremely urgent situation prevailing in the

State for which election of the Panchayats cannot be held within the

time frame. The Supreme Court observed:

Kishansing Tomar (1 supra) held that the five year term fixed for

Municipalities in <a href="/doc/1216677/" id="a_57">Article 243-U</a> is mandatory and that it was

incumbent upon the Election Commission and other authorities to

carry out the mandate of the Constitution and to see that a new

Municipality is constituted in time and elections to it are conducted

before the expiry of its duration of five years. The Supreme Court

opined that the State Election Commission shall not put forward any

excuse raised on unreasonable grounds that the election could not be

completed in time and that it should not yield to situations that may be

created by vested interests to postpone elections from being held

within the stipulated time. It also stated that all State Governments

should recognize the significance of the State Election Commission

which is a constitutional body and abide by its directions. It held that

the Government concern shall have to render full assistance and

cooperation to the State Election Commission and respect the latter's

assessment of the needs in order to ensure that free and fair elections

are conducted. It went further and also said that for the independent

and effective functioning of the State Election Commission, where it

feels that it is not receiving the Cooperation of the State Government

shall be completed before the expiry of its duration specified in

Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1058223/" id="a_59">Article 243-E</a>, i.e., five years from the date appointed for

elections are completed by it and it was awaiting finalization of the

reservations, a step that falls in the domain of the State Government

under Sections 9 and 17 of the Telangana Panchayat Raj Act, 2018. It

with the proposed election schedule as per <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_61">Section 197(6)</a> of the said

holding it to be mandatory. Thus it's inaction before 01.08.2018 and

its delay after 01.08.2018 in conducting of elections to Gram

Panchayats is not bona fide and has to be termed as unconstitutional.

The State cannot be permitted to administer the Gram Panchayats by

it's officials for an unreasonable time defeating the Constitutional

principle of 'local self government' of the Gram Panchayats.

</pre><p id="p_175">118. Though learned counsel for the petitioners had contended that

the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_80">Section 136</a> in the 2018 Act which enables appointment of Special

Officers/Persons-in-charge for Gram Panchayats is not valid since

Part -IX of the Constitution does not permit it, I do not agree with the

said contention since such appointments may have to be made in the

event of natural calamities or extremely urgent situations which

prevent the holding of elections for Gram Panchayats, before the

expiry of their term.
</p>
<p id="p_176">
</p><p id="p_177">119. Another contention advanced was that under sub-Section (1) of

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_81">Section 136</a> of the Act, Special Officers can be appointed only when

the Gram Panchayat is first created and that there is no provision to

appoint Special Officers for existing Gram Panchayats. This is not

correct since sub-Section (3) of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_82">Section 136</a> of the Act empowers the

State to appoint Special Officers/Persons-in-charge for existing Gram

Panchayats also.
</p>
<p id="p_178">
</p><p id="p_179">120. However, the State also cannot be allowed to make use of the

provisions for appointing Special Officers/Persons-in-charge for Gram

Panchayats in sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_83">Section 136</a> of the 2018 Act when it

faced no genuine supervening difficulty of the manner mentioned by

the Supreme Court to conduct elections to Gram Panchayats before

the expiry of their term on 01-08-2018. If it did, it would be an

arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of power making efficient units of

self-government, defunct.

</pre><p id="p_180">dt.13-07-2018 of 1st respondent and the consequent G.O.Ms.Nos.46 to

Constitution of India. Point (d) is answered accordingly.


Point (e)


</p><p id="p_181">122. I will now consider whether the ex-Sarpanchs of the Gram

Panchayats are entitled to be appointed as persons-in-charge/Special

Officers of the Gram Panchayats after the expiry of their term on

01-08-2018.
</p>
<p id="p_182">
</p><p id="p_183">123. It is true that they had been elected as Sarpanchs in 2013 and

most of them held office till 01-08-2018. It is possible that against

most of them, there may not be any allegations of misdemeanor or

misappropriation or misconduct. It is also probably true that they

would be more aware of the needs of the Gram Panchayats where they

got elected and might be in a better position to run the administration

than the non-Gazetted or Gazetted employees of the State. It is also

possible that some of the Special Officers are unable to discharge

effectively their duties in the said position since they have to also

attend to their regular job duties.
</p>
<p id="p_184">
</p><p id="p_185">124. Petitioners submit that the law in India recognizes care taker

Prime Ministers and care taker Chief Ministers when the Parliament

and the State Legislative Assemblies are dissolved.
</p><pre id="pre_19">                                  ::43::                            MSR,J

                                                                 and batch




</pre><p id="p_186">125. In the absence of any provision of law or precedent or practice

mandating the State to continue ex-Sarpanchs as Persons-in-charge

after the expiry of their term as Sarpanchs, the petitioners cannot

claim to be appointed as such as a matter of right. No decision of any

Court was cited in support of the claim of the petitioners/ex-Sarpanchs

that they alone should be appointed as Persons-in-charge of the Gram

Panchayats pending conduct of elections. Mere fact that State

Government, in case of Cooperative Societies, took a different

decision does not mean that in case of Panchayats, it can be compelled

to do the same.
</p>
<p id="p_187">
</p><p id="p_188">126.   Moreover, since it is not disputed that the State Government

had from 18-04-2018 under the 2018 Act increased the number of

Gram Panchayats from 8690 to 12751, and there was also

merger/upgradation    of   306    Gram    Panchayats   as     Municipal

Corporations and Municipalities, there has been a change in the

jurisdiction of the Sarpanchs elected in 2013 under the A.P. Panchayat

Raj Act, 1994. There would be practical difficulties, where a Gram

Panchayat was divided into more than one Gram Panchayat or merged

with Municipal Corporation or Municipality, in deciding which

Sarpanch of which area should be person-in-charge.


</p><p id="p_189">127. So I am not inclined to agree with the contentions of the

petitioners that ex-Sarpanchs should be appointed in the place of the

Special Officers to run the administration of the Gram Panchayats

                                                                 and batch




pending conduct of elections.        Point (e) is answered accordingly

against the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_190">
</p><p id="p_191">128. The Supreme Court in Kishansing Tomar (1 supra) had held

that in the matter of conduct of elections, the State Government

should render full assistance and cooperation to the State Election

Commission and respect the latter's assessment of the needs in order

to ensure that free and fair elections are held. In the State Election

Commission case (3 supra) also the Division Bench of this Court held

that the State Election Commission cannot function and discharge its

duties without the cooperation of the State Government.


</p><p id="p_192">129. In my opinion, it is the duty of the Court exercising power

under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_86">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India to ensure early holding

of elections by the State Election Commission and ensure that the

State Government cooperates with the Commission by completing the

process of enumeration of voters under <a href="/doc/1544801/" id="a_87">Section 13</a> of the 2018 Act,

makes reservations for Wards and Offices of Sarpanchs under

that the constitutional mandate in Part-IX is fulfilled.
