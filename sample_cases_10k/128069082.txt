KULDIP SINGH J. (ORAL)

             Impugned in the present revision petition is the order dated

02.02.2018 passed by learned Civil Judge (Jr. Divn.), Narnaul, vide which

the application filed the petitioners under Order XXVI, Rule 9 CPC, 1908

was dismissed

             Heard.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             It comes out that in a civil suit was filed way back in the year

2013 for simple injunction. Both the parties led evidence. When the case

was fixed at the stage of rebuttal evidence and arguments, an application

Order XXVI, Rule 9 CPC, 1908 was filed for the appointment of revenue

expert as Local Commissioner to demarcate the suit property. The trial court

has taken the view that the controversy qua demarcation of the respective

land was well within the knowledge of the plaintiffs while leading their

evidence. The plaintiffs should have been vigilant to prove their case and

disprove the defendants' case, by leading evidence. The plaintiffs have

already concluded their evidence. In this way, it comes out that the plaintiffs




                                      1 of 2

want to fill up the lacunae left in their evidence by way of leading the

evidence of Local Commissioner, which is, in fact, an additional evidence.

It is a simple suit for permanent injunction, in which the defendant is sought

to be restrained from interfering in the land of the plaintiffs.

</p><p id="p_6">             In the application, it has been mentioned that there is a dispute

between the parties regarding location and demarcation of khasra numbers

and which khasra number falls at what place. In the plaint, such dispute is

not raised. Therefore, at the rebuttal stage, there is no ground to allow to fill

up the lacunae left in the evidence led by the plaintiffs.

</p><p id="p_7">             Learned counsel for the petitioners has relied upon the

authority of the Apex Court delivered in case of "<a href="/doc/675295/" id="a_1">Haryana Waqf Board vs

Shanti Sarup and others</a>", 2008(8) SCC 671.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             A perusal of the said authority shows that it was a suit for

declaration and injunction, where the demarcation was found necessary. It is

not so in the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_9">             As such, the present revision petition is dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
