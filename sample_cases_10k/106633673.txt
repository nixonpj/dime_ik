<pre id="pre_2">                         DATE          : 22 ND FEBRUARY 2018.


ORAL JUDGMENT :


</pre><p id="p_1">1.      Rule. Rule is made returnable forthwith. Heard finally, at the stage

of admission itself, by consent of Mr. Kanade, learned counsel for the

Petitioner, Mr. Devlekar, learned counsel for Respondent No.1-Bank,

and Mr. Alaspurkar, learned A.G.P. for Respondent No.5-State.



</p><p id="p_2">2.      By this Petition, filed under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India,

the Petitioner is challenging the order dated 9 th February 2018 passed

by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai, below "Exhibit-9" in Case

No.74/SA/2017.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">3.      The application at "Exhibit-9" was filed by the present Petitioner in

his capacity as an 'Intervenor', claiming himself to be a 'tenant' in the

Secured Assets. It was contended by him that, as per the 'Agreement of

Tenancy' dated 30th March 2000, he is a bonafide tenant of the attached

property. In this respect, reliance was placed by learned counsel for the

Petitioner on the Judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Vishal N.

 Kalsaria Vs. Bank of India and Ors., (2016) 3 SCC 762 , to submit that,

the Petitioner cannot be dispossessed or evicted from the attached

property, without following the due procedure of law.



</p><p id="p_5">4.      The Trial Court has, however, holding that the issue of tenancy has

to be decided by the Debt Recovery Tribunal and he is not required to

look into it, vide order dated 29th December 2017, rejected the said

application and allowed the Application of Respondent No.1-Bank filed

under Rule 107(11)(vi)(a) of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies

Rules, 1961. The Special Recovery Officer was, accordingly, allowed to

take possession of the attached property.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">5.      Against this order of the Trial Court, the Petitioner has approached

this Court by filing Writ Petition No.212 of 2018 and this Court has, vide

its order dated 23rd January 2018, set aside the said order, remanding

the matter back to the Trial Court for fresh hearing on "Exhibit-9", after

giving an opportunity of hearing to both the parties on all the aspects,

including the issue of tenancy.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">6.      Thereafter, the Trial Court has again heard learned counsel for

both the parties and passed the impugned order rejecting the application

at "Exhibit-9".

</p><p id="p_11"> 7.      This order of the Trial Court is challenged in this Writ Petition by

learned counsel for the Petitioner by submitting that, the Trial Court has

relied upon the Judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Harshad

Govardhan Sondagar Vs. International Assets Reconstruction Company

Limited and Ors., (2014) 6 SCC 1, to hold that,


            "The alleged tenant has to produce proof of execution of a
            registered instrument in his favour by the 'Lessor' and
            when he does not produce such proof and relies only on an
            unregistered instrument or oral agreement, accompanied
            by     delivery      of    possession,    the   Chief    Metropolitan
            Magistrate or the District Magistrate, as the case may be,
            will have to come to the conclusion that he is not entitled
            to the possession of the Secured Assets for more than a
            year from the date of the instrument or from the date of
            delivery of possession in his favour by the landlord."



</p><p id="p_12">8.      It is urged that, this stand taken up by the Apex Court in the case

of Harshad Govardhan Sondagar (Supra), was re-considered by the

Apex Court in the case of Vishal N. Kalsaria (Supra) and it was held in

paragraph No.30 of the said Judgment that,


            "Mere factum of non-registration of the 'Instrument/Deed'
            will not make the lease itself nugatory. If no written 'Lease
            Deed' exists, then, such tenants are required to prove that
            they have been in occupation of the premises as 'tenants',
            by producing such evidence in the proceedings under
            <a href="/doc/57488768/" id="a_2">Section 14</a> of the SARFAESI Act before the learned
            Magistrate."

<p id="p_13"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                               4/10</span>

</p><p id="p_14"> 9.      It is urged that, in the instant case, therefore, merely because the

registered instrument of 'Lease Deed' is not produced, the Trial Court

has refused to accept the tenancy of the Petitioner and hence, this

finding of the Trial Court is required to be quashed and set aside, as it is

not in accordance with law. Further it is submitted that, the Trial Court

has brushed aside the documentary evidence produced on record by the

Petitioner; namely, the rent receipts, and the order of interim injunction

passed by the Small Causes Court, Bombay, in R.A.D. Suit No.549 of

2014, in which the 'landlord' was restrained from disturbing possession

of the Petitioner in the suit property. The said order was passed on 1 st

November 2014 and it clearly goes to show that the Petitioner is in

possession of the suit premises as a 'tenant'. However, the Trial Court

has not considered the said evidence only on the count that, Respondent

No.1-Bank was not party to the said proceedings and, therefore, that

order of the Small Causes Court is not binding upon Respondent No.1-

Bank.
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">10.     Thirdly, it is submitted that, the Trial Court has, in paragraph

No.12 of its Judgment, relying upon the decision of the Apex Court in the

case of Vishal N. Kalsaria (Supra), held that,


            "In view of amended provision of <a href="/doc/112742697/" id="a_3">Section 17(4A)</a> of the
            SARFAESI Act, the issue of tenant/lessee/third person has

             to be decided by the Debt Recovery Tribunal and this Court
            has no jurisdiction to deal with it".
</p>
<p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">11.     It is urged that, none of these findings of the Trial Court can be

upheld in law and, therefore, the impugned order passed by the Trial

Court needs to be quashed and set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">12.     Per contra, learned counsel for Respondent No.1-Bank has

supported the impugned order passed by the Trial Court by pointing out

that, in the instant case, there is apparent collusion between the

Petitioner and the landlord. The Suit is filed by the Petitioner only after

the 'Recovery Certificate' was issued in favour of Respondent No.1-Bank.

All the documents, which are produced by Respondent No.1-Bank before

the Trial Court and before this Court, also show that, as on today also,

the 'landlord' is in possession of the suit premises and, therefore, there is

hardly any substance in the plea of tenancy raised by the Petitioner.



</p><p id="p_21">13.     I have given my thoughtful consideration to the submissions

advanced at bar by learned counsel for both the parties.



</p><p id="p_22">14.     It may be stated that, while deciding the Petition under Rule

107(11)(vi)(a) of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Rules, 1961,

the Court has only to consider whether the 'Intervenor', in this case the

Petitioner, is in possession of the suit premises, as claimed by him in his

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                          6/10</span>
WP-2300-18==.doc

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">        ::: Uploaded on - 26/02/2018                ::: Downloaded on - 27/02/2018 01:25:36 :::</span>
 capacity as a 'tenant'. Even if it is accepted that the registered

instrument of lease is not necessary to prove the tenancy, there has to

be some convincing evidence to show that the Petitioner is actually in

possession of the suit premises. Here in the case, entire reliance of the

Petitioner is on the order passed by the Small Causes Court, Bombay,

thereby granting relief of interim injunction, restraining the 'landlord'

from causing obstruction to the possession of the Petitioner in the suit

premises. However, as rightly submitted by learned counsel for

Respondent No.1-Bank, the said Suit was filed by the Petitioner only

after the 'Recovery Certificate' was issued and it is pertinent to note

that, against the said order, the 'landlord' has not preferred any Appeal

or challenged the same.
</p>
<p id="p_23">

</p><p id="p_24">15.     Thus, prima facie, when there is no registered 'Deed of Lease' and

the entire reliance is placed on the unregistered instrument, which was

executed before the Notary, and considering the fact that such Suit was

filed only after the 'Recovery Certificate' was issued and against the

order passed therein, the 'landlord' has not preferred any Appeal,

apparently, the possibility of such Suit being collusive cannot be ruled

out. On the basis thereof or on the strength of rent receipts, it becomes

difficult to accept the bonafides of the claim of the Petitioner of being in

possession of the suit premises as a 'tenant'. Especially in the absence of

any documentary evidence to show that the Petitioner is actually in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                       7/10</span>

 possession of the suit premises, prior to or, for that sake, even

subsequent to the the order passed in the Suit by the Small Causes

Court, Bombay. Neither there is electricity bills, nor telephone bills, nor

Municipal tax bills, correspondence, Shop Act Licence, not a single

document worth the name to prove his possession in the suit premises.

As can be seen from the impugned order passed by the Trial Court, all

the documents produced on record by Respondent No.1-Bank go to show

that, all along, it is the 'landlord' only, who is in possession of the suit

premises. Those documents are also issued by totally independent

authorities. The first document, on which the Trial Court has relied upon

is the letter dated 29th January 2018 issued by the "Andheri Vertex

Vikas Premises Co-operative Society Limited", wherein suit property is

situate, clearly stating that, "they have not received any application

from      the      'landlord'      seeking   permission     from       the     Society        to

let/rent/lease/sublet the said property".            Needless to state that, the

property being the part of "Andheri Vertex Vikas Premises Co-operative

Housing Society", it cannot be sublet or given on rent, without

permission of the said Society. If the suit property was let-out, as stated

by the Petitioner, in the year 2000 itself, then, there should have been

such permission from the said Society.
</p>
<p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">16.     Even the 'Valuation Report', dated 10th October 2014, which was

prepared, at the time of sanction and disbursement of the loan, by


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                             8/10</span>

 M/s. H. Mehta and Associates, goes to show that the 'landlord' was in

possession of the suit premises. Apart from that, even the Shop Act

Licence, till today, stands in the name of the 'landlord', as can be seen

from the document dated 29th January 2018. The 'Panchanama' dated

8th   August        2014,       conducted   by     the   Special      Recovery         Officer

Mr. Nandkishor Sawant, also makes it clear that it is the 'landlord', who

is in possession of the attached property.
</p>
<p id="p_27">

</p><p id="p_28">17.     Thus, none of the documents produced on record support the case

of the Petitioner that he is actually in possession of the suit property and

that too in his capacity as a 'tenant'.
</p>
