the entire amount outstanding in the said demand loan General A/C

no.DLP/GEN.02/2001   of   the   defendant   no.1   with   interest   and

charges.  It has been stated further that the plaintiff  bank sent a legal

notice dt.19/10/05 through UPC as the defendant no.1 failed to keep

up their commitment in repaying the plaintiff bank's dues as agreed,

inspite   of   repeated   reminders   in   writing,   legal   notice,   personal

contacts   and   requesting   them   to   repay   entire   balance   due   and

outstanding   in   the   said   loan   account   as   agreed   but   the   both   the

suit.

Predecessor.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                   Thereafter   the   plaintiff   bank   led   the   ex­parte   evidence

and examined Sh. B.S. Bist, AR of the plaintiff bank as PW1, who has

filed his evidence by way of affidavit.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                   In his examination­in­chief tendered by way of affidavit,

the   aforesaid   witness   examined   by   the   plaintiff,   has  reiterated   and

reaffirmed   the   contents   as   stated   in   the   plaint   and   has   exhibited

various documents  Ex.PW1/1 to Ex.PW1/9  i.e. Power of Attorney,

general   agreement,   receipt   of   bank   dt.07/12/01,   legal   notice,

record   and   have   heard   the   submissions   as   advanced   by   the   Ld.

counsel for the plaintiff bank. 
</p>
<p id="p_11">                   The   case   of   the   plaintiff   is   that   at   the   request   of   the

defendant no. 1 approached the plaintiff bank for personal loan, was

sanctioned   and   disbursed  the   personal  loan  of  Rs.43,778/­.   It  has

been further submitted that the defendant no. 2 stood as co­obligant /


Suit no.920/2008                                                                      Page : 5/7
 co­borrower for the repayment of the amounts what may be due and

outstanding against the said term loan facility. Later on defendant no.

1   failed   to   maintain   financial   discipline   and   failed   to   clear   the

outstanding balance despite repeated requests by the plaintiff bank. It

is   submitted   that   the   even   despite   service   of   legal   notice   dated

19/10/05,   the   defendants   failed   to   clear   the   dues   and   as   such   the

defendants are liable to pay the said amount of the plaintiff bank. 

</p><p id="p_12">                   The defendants remained ex­parte and the plaintiff bank

examined   PW   1   towards   ex­parte   plaintiff   evidence,   who   has

exhibited   various   documents,   as   discussed   herein   above.     In   my

opinion,   the   testimony   of   PW   1   remained   unrebutted   and

unchallenged.   There   is   nothing   on   the   record   to   disbelieve   the

testimony of PW 1.  As such, I am of the opinion that plaintiff bank

has been able to prove its case on record.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                   In  the  light  of  the  aforesaid  discussion,  the  suit  of the

plaintiff is hereby decreed for a sum of Rs.43,778/­.  So far as interest

is   concerned,   in   my   opinion,   it   would   be   sufficient,   in   these

circumstances of the case, if the interest @ 9 % per annum from the

date of filing of the suit till the date of its realization is granted. 

</p><p id="p_14">                   Accordingly, the suit of the plaintiff is hereby decreed in

annum from the date of filing of the suit till the date of its realization.

Costs of the suit are also awarded in favour of the plaintiff.
