                     R.S.A. No. 908 of 2007
              ----------------------------------------
                Dated this the 06th day of July, 2018

                            JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     This appeal is against the decree and judgment dated

30.06.2007 in A.S.No.130/1998 on the file of the Court of the

Subordinate Judge, Tirur.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2. A suit in O.S.No.55/94 before the Munsiff's Court, Tirur,

was filed by the plaintiffs for fixation of boundary and recovery of

encroached portion of property.     The suit was dismissed by the

Trial Court, but in appeal the First Appellate Court reversed the

same by granting a decree fixing the boundary in accordance with

the boundary located in Exhibit C3 plan and the same is made as

part of the decree.     Aggrieved by the said decree, the first

defendant came up with this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3.   The case advanced by the plaintiffs is that plaintiffs 2

and 3 obtained the property scheduled in the plaint under Exhibit

A1 partition deed of the year 1947 and they were in possession

and enjoyment of the same. It is alleged that certain portion of

the said property was encroached by the defendants and hence

the suit for fixation of boundary and recovery of possession.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">R.S.A. No. 908 of 2007              2</span>



</p><p id="p_4">      4.      The    defendants,   in   turn,   contended   that   their

predecessor-in-interest, one Beevi Umma and others, were

parties to Exhibit A1 partition deed and the property allotted to

their share was mortgaged in the year 1954 under Exhibit B1

document in favour of one Muhammad and Saidalavi. They, in

turn, in the year 1957, under Exhibit B2 document, assigned the

mortgage in favour of the first defendant. Subsequently, Beevi

Umma had released her right of equity of redemption in favour of

the first defendant in the year 1960 under Exhibit B3 document.

Hence, the first defendant claimed title over the property based

on Exhibits B1 to B3 documents. The Commissioner who visited

the property measured out the property based on Exhibit A1

partition deed and the respective title deeds claimed by the

plaintiffs as well as the first defendant and located the property

in tune with the averments in Exhibit A1 partition deed. Both the

parties are claiming their title from the parental document of

Exhibit A1 partition deed. Exhibits B1 to B3 are the subsequent

documents executed by Beevi Umma and others and the person

litigating under them. In short, the defendants stepped into the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">R.S.A. No. 908 of 2007                  3</span>



shoes of Beevi Umma and others who are parties to Exhibit A1

partition deed.      They can only claim the property which was

allotted to the share of Beevi Umma and others and if the

documents executed, exhibited as B1 to B3, cover any excess

land, it would not be binding on the other party to the document,

Exhibit A1 partition deed, the parental document. Now, the

Commissioner has located the property based on Exhibit A1

parental document and the plan was prepared in accordance with

the property description given in Exhibit A1 partition deed.           If

that be so, there cannot be any reason for any interference to

the location of          the property       in Exhibit   C3 plan   by the

Commissioner based on Exhibit A1 partition deed.

</p><p id="p_5">      5. The learned counsel for the appellant further submitted

that the suit was simply filed for recovery of possession and

fixation of boundary and though the title to the plaintiffs was

disputed by the defendants herein no prayer for declaration of

their title over the property, at least to the property alleged to

have been encroached was incorporated in the suit and as such

the suit will not stand and took reliance from the decision drawn
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">R.S.A. No. 908 of 2007               4</span>



by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/540361/" id="a_1">Anathula Sudhakar v. P. Buchi Reddy

and Others</a> [(2008) 4 SCC 594]. Since both parties are claiming

their respective title under a parental document - Exhibit A1, the

contention of denial of title to one of the parties under that

document is not available to the defendants herein. Further, the

property jointly owned by Beevi Umma and others were

partitioned and separated by exclusively giving various plots to

parties to the partition deed.      That itself would show that they

themselves has admitted exclusive right given to               other party

even at the time of execution of partition deed and thereafter

they cannot come and say that the other party has no right over

the property allotted to them under the very same deed.                  In

other words, the defendants are estopped from raising such a

contention and hence the non inclusion of prayer for declaration

of title is not fatal to the case advanced by the plaintiffs. It is

really not at all necessary in a suit of this nature when both the

parties are claiming their respective title under a parental

partition deed. It is also brought to the notice of this Court the

decision    rendered     by   a   Single   Bench   of   this     Court   in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">R.S.A. No. 908 of 2007           5</span>



Nandakumara Varma and Another v. Usha Varma and

Another [2014 KHC 854] in order to advance a case that the

property belonged to the defendant has not been scheduled in

the plaint. The legal position settled in the said decision is lying

on a different footing that there cannot be any question of

fixation of boundary unless the property sought to be fixed lying

adjoining to the other property. The facts involved in this case is

lying on an entirely different situation and hence the above said

decision has no application in the present case. No other ground

urged before me and hence the appeal fails, deserves only a

dismissal, but without cost.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      In the result, the appeal is dismissed. No order as to costs.
