        The PSI of Nandini Layout Police Station has filed the final report as

against the accused persons for the offence punishable under Sec. 427 r/w

34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a> and Sec. 3 (1) of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act-

1984.


        2. The brief facts of the case of the prosecution is that on 3.4.2017 at

10 a.m. when C.W.1 Srinivas was going in his lorry bearing No. KA-42-

854 loading the brick near Kanteerava Studio, accused persons came in two

wheeler and damaged the lorry of C.W.1 by hitting with club and caused

loss and thereby committed the aforesaid offences.

        3. The accused persons are being produced under body warrant.

Prosecution papers are furnished to the accused persons in compliance of

207 of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Cr.P.C</a> and after hearing before charge, since no grounds were made

out for their discharge, charges were framed, read over to the accused

persons in the language known to them. The accused persons having

understood the same, denied it to be false and claimed to be tried. As such,

the matter was set down for trial.


        4. The prosecution in order to prove the guilt of the accused persons

had cited C.W.1 to 6 as its charge sheet witnesses, among whom C.W.1 has
                                        3

been examined as P.W.1 and got marked Ex.P.1 and P.2.           The accused

persons were not questioned under Sec. 313 of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a>. as there were no

incriminating material available in the case of the prosecution.      As such,

the matter was posted for arguments.


      5. Heard the learned Sr. APP for the prosecution and the learned

counsel for the accused persons. Perused the materials available on record.


      6. Following point arise for my consideration:


         (1) Whether the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that
             the accused persons have committed the offences punishable
             under Sec. Sec. 427 r/w 34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a> and Sec. 3 (1) of Prevention
             of Damage to Public Property Act-1984 ?


         (2) What order ?

      7. Having regard to the arguments heard and the materials placed on

record, my answer to the above points are :

      Point No.1         :      In the negative.
      Point No.2         :      See final order, for the following:

                                   REASONS

Point No.1:
                                      4

      8.     P.W.1 is the complainant in this case and he has turned out

hostile to the case of the prosecution and stated that the accused persons

have not picked up quarrel with hi and not damaged his lorry with club and

the police have not seized properties and he has not given any statement

before the Police. In the cross-examination P.W.1 has stated that he has

compromised the matter with the accused persons. Hence, the prayer of Sr.

APP for issuance of summons is rejected as it will be of futile exercise in

view of hostile evidence of P.W.1 complainant himself.            Hence, the

prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the accused persons beyond all

reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I answer the above point in the negative.


Point No. 2 :

      9. In view of the reasons stated at point No.1, I proceed to pass the

following:
