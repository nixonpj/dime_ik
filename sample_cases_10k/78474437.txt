</p>
<p id="p_3">                                   Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the

                 petitioner is merely a transporter of the vehicle bearing Truck

             that the aforementioned truck which was being plied by the said

             Vikash Kumar Karan was loaded with maize seeds belonging to

             the informant and was sent from Purnea to Bhawanipur but the

             aforementioned seeds did not reach its destination from where the

             informant started search and informed the transporter. No sooner

             the transporter learnt that the truck in question had not reached its

             destination with the goods loaded thereon, he started making

             enquiry and tracing the whereabouts of the said driver but having

             failed in his efforts, he lodged F.I.R. on 25.10.2014 against the

             driver and conductor of the truck and another accused persons

             which is Annexure-2. It is further submitted that the informant,

             however, after saddling              the liability on the shoulders of the

             petitioner did not take any step for filing any case against the said

             Vikash Kumar Karn to whom the goods had been entrusted by him

             on 20.10.2014. The petitioner submits that he as transporter made

             all efforts to locate the driver Vikash Kumar Karn who appeared

             to have vacated his house and shifted to another place It is only

             because the petitioner had hired the vehicle of one Dharmendra

             Kumar who had given the truck on lease to Vikash Kumar Karan

             which was being used by the petitioner as one of many vehicles in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.6894 of 2015 (8) dt.26-11-2015</span>

             his transport business, that the petitioner is apprehending his arrest

             for loss of the goods of the informant.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                               Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits

             that ultimately the vehicle was found in the empty state near Signe

             Hotel at Gulab Bagh and whereabout of the truck driver could not

             be located.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                               Learned counsel for the informant submits that the

             entrustment of the goods was to the transporter and not to the

             driver in question and, therefore, he must face the consequence of

             any loss occasioned by him. However, the explanation offered by

             the informant with regard to delay in filing of the present F.I.R.

             stands unexplained, as even though the petitioner had lodged his

             first information report with regard to the action of the driver of

             the concerned vehicle, no steps were taken by the informant to

             lodge any F.I.R. against the concerned accused persons.

</p><p id="p_7">                               Considering the nature of allegation made against

             the petitioner, his efforts to locate the driver of the vehicle who

             had taken away the goods in question and also the fact that the

             said Dharmendra Kumar who was transporter has already been

             granted anticipatory bail by the court below, let the petitioner,

             abovenamed, in the event of his arrest or surrender before the

             court below within four weeks from today, be released on bail on
