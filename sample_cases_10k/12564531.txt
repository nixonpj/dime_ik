439 <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_27">Cr.P.C</a>. before the learned trial court which was allowed by the

learned trial court vide order dated 4-5-2019. Hence, being

aggrieved the present appeal seeking cancellation of bail has been

filed by the complainant challenging the order dated 4-5-2019

passed by the learned trial court.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.   Counsel for the complainant submitted that the order passed

by the learned trial court amounts to judicial indiscipline and once

the appeal preferred by the accused seeking bail has been

dismissed by the High Court after considering statement of the

prosecturix the learned trial court while exercising its power under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_28">section 439</a> Cr.P.C. erred in granting bail to the accused as there

was no change in the circumstances after rejection of his appeal

by this Court seeking bail under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_29">Section 439</a> Cr.P.C. Counsel

further submits that the victim (minor girl) aged about 16 years

has been raped by two persons and the victim in her statement

recorded during trial has specifically levelled the allegation of

committing rape on her against the accused.

</p><p id="p_9">7.    Counsel further submits that the learned trial court erred in

granting bail to the accused on the ground that he is in custody

since 18-4-2017.
</p>
<p id="p_10">8.    Counsel further submits that certainly the High Court can

cancel the bail granted by the Sessions Court, looking to the

seriousness of the offence alleged against the accused and in the

present matter the accused along with co-accused raped a minor

girl who is a special child having mild mental retardation.

</p><p id="p_11">9.   In support of the contentions, counsel relied upon the

judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of

Anil Kumar Yadav Vs. State (NCT of Delhi) &amp; Anr., &amp;

connected matters, reported in (2018) 12 SCC 129 and

particularly referred para-24 &amp; 32, which read as under :-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">                   "24. As pointed out earlier, one of the
             grounds for grant of bail to the appellant Anil
             Kumar Yadav by the Sessions Court was that he
             was in custody for more than one year. In
             crimes like murder, the mere fact that the
             accused was in custody for more than one year,
             may not be a relevant consideration. In
             Gobarbhai Naranbhai case, it was observed that
             the period of incarceration by itself would not
             entitle the accused to be enlarged on bail. The
             same was reiterated in <a href="/doc/836557/" id="a_30">Ram Govind Upadhyay v.
             Sudarshan Singh</a>.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">                   32. It was repeatedly urged that the High
             Court misdirected itself in interfering with the
             discretionary order of the Sessions Court
             granting bail to the accused and there was
             absolutely nothing to show that the appellants
             are likely to abuse the bail or tamper with
             evidence. The court while granting bail should
             exercise its discretion in a judicious manner. Of
             course, once discretion is exercised by the
             Sessions Court to grant bail on consideration of
             relevant materials, the High Court would not
             normally interfere with such discretion, unless
             the same suffers from serious infirmities or
             perversity. While considering the correctness of
             the order granting bail, the approach should be
             whether the order granting bail to the accused is
             vitiated by any serious infirmity, in which case,
             the High Court can certainly interfere with the
             exercise of discretion. The materials available on
             record prima facie indicating the involvement of
             the accused, possibility of accused tampering
             with witness and the gravity of the crime were
             not kept in view by the Sessions Court. Since
             the Sessions Court granted bail to the appellants
             on irrelevant considerations and the same
             suffered from serious infirmity, the High Court
             rightly set aside the order of grant of bail to the
             accused. The impugned orders do not suffer
             from any infirmity warranting interference."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">10. Counsel further relied upon the judgment passed by a

Coordinate Bench of this Court before the Principal Seat at

Jodhpur in the matter of Ashok Sachdeva Vs. State &amp; Anr.,

reported in 2012(3) WLC (Raj.) 85.

</p><p id="p_15">11. Counsel submits that in the light of the judgments (supra),

the order passed by the learned trial court dated 4-5-2019

granting bail to the accused under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_31">Section 439</a> Cr.P.C. deserves to

be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_16">12. Counsel for the accused on the other hand submits that the

accused has not threatened the complainant and the learned trial

court has rightly passed the order dated 4-5-2019 as the trial got

delayed.
</p>
<p id="p_17">13. Counsel further submits that the power of trial court granting

bail under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_32">Section 439</a> Cr.P.C. is similar to that of High Court and

the trial court has not committed any illegality in granting bail to

the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_18">14. Counsel further submits that the parameters of cancellation

of bail under section 439(2) Cr.P.C. are different than that of

granting bail under Section 439 Cr.P.C.

<p id="p_19">15. In support of the contentions, counsel for the accused relied

upon the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the

matter of Rameshwar Sharma Vs. Director of Revenue

Intelligence, reported in (2018)11 SCC 713 and Sharad T.

Kabra Vs. Union of India, reported in (2018) 14 SCC 493.

Court. I am of the considered view that the learned trial court has

committed gross illegality in granting bail to the accused, more

                                   looking to the seriousness of the offence, the reason assigned by

                                   the learned trial court that the accused is in custody since 18-4-

                                   2017, in my considered view may not be a relevant consideration

                                   for exercising discretion in favour of the accused under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_35">section

                                   is directed to place a copy of this order before the Hon'ble Chief

                                   Justice for information.

                                   cancellation of bail is allowed. The order passed by the learned

                                   trial court dated 4-5-2019 is set aside. The bail bonds of the

                                   accused are directed to be cancelled and the learned Trial Judge is

                                   directed to take the accused into custody and proceed with the
