<p id="p_1">4.   12-08-2010               Heard the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                              In a criminal prosecution registered under

                  <a href="/doc/329571/" id="a_1">section 392</a> of the Indian Penal Code, it is submitted that

                  the petitioner is not named in the F.I.R. as an accused

                  and no incriminating articles have been recovered either

                  from the house or from the possession of the petitioner. It

                  is also submitted that petitioner has not been put on test

                  identification parade till date.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                              From perusal of the F.I.R. vide Annexure-1, it

                  is apparent that it is a case of Highway robbery, having

                  taken place between the sun-set and sun rise. Name of

                  the petitioner has transpired in the present case on the

                  basis of confessional statement made by co-accused Hare

                  Ram Paswan from whose possession and house several

                  looted articles were recovered.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                              Learned counsel for the State has highlighted

                  that as many as seven other criminal cases of similar

                  nature are pending against this petitioner.

</p><p id="p_5">                              Taking into consideration the entire facts and

                  circumstances referred above, this court is not persuaded

        to accede to the prayer made on behalf of the petitioner

        for grant of bail. The prayer for bail made on behalf of the

        petitioner is rejected at this stage.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                    Learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Nalanda is

        directed to take steps forthwith for framing of charge

        against the petitioner and all endeavour should be made

        to conclude the trial of the petitioner as early as possible

        preferably within a period of nine months from the date

        of framing of charge. It is hoped that the charge against

        the petitioner shall be framed within a period of one

        month from the date of receipt/production of a copy of

        this order. However, if within a period of nine months

        from the date of framing of charge, trial of the petitioner

        is not concluded, then, the petitioner shall be at liberty

        to renew the prayer for bail.

        at the cost of the petitioner.
