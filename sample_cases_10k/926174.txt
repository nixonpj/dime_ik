sentenced  to undergo rigorous imprisonments  for  different

behalf	of  the	 appellant  was	 dismissed  by	the  learned
additional  Sessions Judge, Ghaziabad.	The High  Court,  on
revision application being filed on behalf of the  appellant
set-aside  his	conviction  under  <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_11">Section  120-B</a>,  but	 the
conviction and sentence under other Sections mentioned above
passed by the trial Court were affirmed.

Small Industries Corporation and got a sum of Rs. 39,352.50,

discovered that the aforesaid Seemak Industrial Corporation,
was  a fake concern and the appellant had cheated, even	 the
U.P. Small Industries Corporation, in respect of the  amount
advanced  by them.  The Trial Court, the Appellate Court  as
well  as  the  High  Court have gone  into  details  of	 the
materials on record for purpose of holding, that the charges
framed	against	 the appellant had been established  and  as

and sentence passed against him.

been  committed	 by the appellant, as early as in  the	year
1973,	more  than  20	years  from  now  and  as   such   a
compassionate  view  should  be taken of  the  whole  matter
especially when the amount in respect of which the  offences
are  alleged  to have been committed is not  excessive.	  He
pointed out that the appellant has remained in jail for some
time,  in pursuance of the order of conviction and  sentence
and as such he need not be sent to jail again.	An affidavit
detailing  the mitigating circumstances has also been  filed
by   the   appellant  before  us.  Taking  all	 facts	 and
circumstances  into consideration, by our order	 dated	26th
