SRI. VENKATESH DODDERI, AGA FOR R2 TO R5]

     THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226 AND
227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO QUASH THE
ORDER DTD 20.08.2017 PASSED IN R.P.319/12-13 BY THE R-3
VIDE ANNEXURE-A.

    THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING, THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
                                  3



                             ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Learned Additional Government Advocate takes notice

for Respondents 2 to 5. Insofar as Respondent No.1 is

concerned, he has already entered appearance by caveat

through learned counsel Sri. Manjunath G. Kandekar, who is

present before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.    Petitioner   herein       is   claiming   that    he   has

purchased land bearing Sy. No.17/3 of Sreeramanahalli

Village, Hesaraghatta Hobli, Bengaluru North Taluk, under

registered sale deed from Respondent No.7 as General Power

of Attorney holder of Respondent No.6 and sought for

registration of khata of the said land in his name.           In the

meanwhile, it is seen that the Respondent No.6, after granting

general power of attorney in favour of Respondent No.7 with

reference to the same land, has independently transacted

with other persons in creating confusion regarding title of the

petitioner with reference to the very same land.            When the

matter stood thus, it is seen that the mutation entries said to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  4</span>


have made in favour of the petitioner was subject matter of

challenge     before     the      Respondent         No.2-Assistant

Commissioner in proceedings No.RA.625/2007-08, which

came to be disposed of by order dated 18.06.2010 vide

Annexure-L.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      3.    The grievance of the petitioner is that the said

order at Annexure-L was challenged nearly after two years by

the Respondent No.1 who is also claiming title on the very

same property under a registered sale deed executed by

Respondent No.6 himself in his individual capacity. The said

revision petition registered as R.P. No.319/2012-13 came up

for   consideration    before   the   Respondent      No.3-Deputy

Commissioner     which    is    disposed   of   by    order   dated

28.08.2017 which is at Annexure-A to the writ petition.


</p><p id="p_6">      4.    The petitioner herein is challenging the said order

on    the   premise    that     the   Respondent      No.3-Deputy

Commissioner did not have any right to entertain the revision

petition in RP No.319/2012-13 to interfere with the order of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   5</span>


the Respondent No.2 dated 18.06.2010. Admittedly, there is

dispute between the petitioner, Respondent No.1 as well as

Respondents 6 and 7 in this proceedings with reference to

title to the land bearing Sy. No.17/3 of Sreeramanahalli

Village,   Hesaraghatta       Hobli,   Bengaluru   North   Taluk,

measuring 3 acres 9 guntas, which is subject matter of two

sale deeds, thereby indicating that there is dispute of title

with reference to the said land.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">      5.    In that view of the matter, the order of the

Respondent No.2 directing the Tahsildar to register the khata

of the said property in the name of one of the persons is not

permissible.   Therefore, the revenue entries which is now

registered in the name of the petitioner shall be continued as

subject to litigation in OS No.167/2009 and the same shall

continue as it is, until the said suit is decided on merit with

reference to the title to the property bearing Sy. No.17/3 of

Sreeramanahalli    Village,     Hesaraghatta   Hobli,   Bengaluru

North Taluk.    Therefore, the order of the Respondent No.2
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 6</span>


appears to be correct which cannot be interfered. It is made

clear that the Tahsildar shall refer to the order passed in this

writ petition as well as pendency of original suit in OS

No.167/2009 on the file of the Principal Civil Judge [Sr. Dn.,],

Bengaluru Rural District, and the same shall be subject to

outcome of the said suit.       The necessary entries shall be

carried out immediately in the RTC of Sy. No.17/3 of

Sreeramanahalli    Village,   Hesaraghatta     Hobli,   Bengaluru

North Taluk, within two weeks from today.


</p><p id="p_9">       6.   With   such observation,    this    writ    petition is

disposed of.
