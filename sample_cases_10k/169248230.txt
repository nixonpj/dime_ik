 upon being presented for encashment.          It was the claim of

 respondent no.1 that the said cheques had been issued towards

 legal debt and liability and that even after notice was issued by the

 respondent no.1 to the accused for making payments, the accused

 had failed to do so, thereby committing offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_5">Section 138</a>

 of the aforesaid Act. The accused appeared before the Magistrate

 on being summoned and denied the allegations made against

 them and further claimed to be innocent. The respondent no.1

 through its partner placed evidence by way of affidavit on record

 and also examined official of the postal department in order to

 prove service of notice on the accused. The respondent no.1 also

 examined a chartered accountant as its witness, in order to prove

 the fact that the cheques in question had been dishonoured. The

 respondent no.1 also placed documentary material on record to

 show that its partner had been authorised to prosecute the

 complaints and to depose before the Magistrate.

 that supply of material had been made by the respondent no.1 to a

 separate entity at Nagpur and that the applicant no.1 being

 concerned only with the office at Bhopal, could not be said to be

 also raised contentions pertaining to the complaint filed by

 could not have filed the complaint in the capacity of complainant.

 applicants i.e. accused Nos.1 and 3 were liable for the offence

 punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_6">Section 138</a> of the aforesaid Act. It was found

 that the complaints were maintainable at the behest of respondent

 had not been able to specify as to when the notice purportedly

 judgments and orders. In this regard, the learned counsel for the

 applicants placed reliance on judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme

 Court in the case of Dulichand Laxminarayan Vs. Commissioner

 of       Income Tax reported in AIR 1956 SC 354(1) and N.

 Khadervali Saheb(dead) by Lrs. And anr. Vs. N.Gudusahib and

 ors. reported in (2003) 3 SCC 229. The learned counsel for the

 respondent no.1 pointed out that there was distinction between

 capacity of a firm like respondent no.1 to initiate civil proceedings

 and the capacity to initiate a criminal proceedings like the

 complaints in the present case filed under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_22">Section 138</a> of the

 aforesaid Act. <a href="/doc/1674475/" id="a_23">Sections 7</a>, <a href="/doc/1680872/" id="a_24">9</a> and <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_25">142</a> of the aforesaid Act become

 relevant in the present context because as per <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_26">Section 142</a> of the

 Act, a complaint is to be submitted in writing for an offence

 punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_27">Section 138</a> of the Act by a payee or holder in

 been defined in <a href="/doc/1674475/" id="a_28">Section 7</a> of that Act as the person named in the

 instrument ( in this case the cheques in question) and '' holder in

 Agencies was the payee because the cheques were undisputedly

 issued in its name and its partner was the holder in due course

 who filed the complaints pertaining to dishonour of cheques.

 Therefore, it becomes clear that the contention raised on behalf of

 the applicants that the complaints in the present case could not

 have been filed by the respondent no.1 is unsustainable. In this

 context, the learned counsel for the respondent no.1 has correctly

 relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the

 case of Shankar Finance and Investments Vs. State of Andhra

 Pradesh and ors. reported in (2008) 8 SCC 536, wherein it has

 been found that in a criminal complaint relating to an offence

 under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_30">Section 138</a> of the said Act, it is permissible to lodge the

 complaint in the name of the payee.       Reliance placed by the

 learned counsel for the respondent no.1 on judgment of the

 Madras High Court in the case of Jothi Sarees Vs. PON

 Muruganatham, reported in 2006 (1) (MWN)(CR.)(DCC) 45, is

 also appropriate because in the said judgment it has been held that

 even an unregistered partnership could certainly maintain

 that an affidavit not in the form prescribed under order XIX of

 that since it was not even on oath, the courts below could not have

 relied upon the same for convicting and sentencing the applicants.

 In this regard a perusal of the affidavit in evidence filed on behalf

 of the respondent no.1 would show that the details of the

 deponent are very much stated on record and it is also specifically

 stated that the complaint is being filed by the deponent, who is an

 authorised person to file the complaint on behalf of the respondent

 no.1 which is a registered partnership firm. The verification

 appended to the affidavit on evidence clearly asserts that the

 court in the revision applications and that too by way of

 amendment. It is a settled position of law that if such technical

 objections are to be raised, they have to be raised before the

 original court and not after the proceedings have travelled much

 further before the appellate and revisional courts. In this regard,

 the learned counsel appearing for the respondent no.1 is justified

 in relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the

 case of Vinita S. Rao Vs. Essen Corporate Services (P) LTD.

 circumstances that technical objection pertaining to copy of power

                    trial court and in the lower appellate
                    court weakens its force. The High
                    Court, in our opinion, erred in
                    entertaining such a belated argument.
                    Having entertained the argument, the
                    High Court dealt with it in a very
                    perfunctory manner. The High Court
                    observed that Sudhir Gulvady, the
                    power of attorney holder did not
                    produce the power of attorney and,
                    hence, he could not have been
                    examined on behalf of the complainant.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                    The High Court further observed that
                    the complainant who examined herself
                    also did not say why the power of
                    attorney      was     not     produced.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                    Significantly, the appellant has not
                    been questioned on this aspect. Not

 the applicants on the above mentioned judgments to emphasize

 that the entire evidence of respondent no.1 ought to have been

 discarded because there was non-compliance of order XIX of

 C.P.C. cannot be accepted. In this context, it also becomes clear

 that the objection with regard to lack of material to show that

 respondent no.1 was registered partnership firm, is also without

 any substance. The contents of the complaint and the affidavit in

 evidence filed on behalf of the respondent no.1 clearly show that

 the said respondent being a registered firm was emphatically

 stated and this was not specifically denied by the applicants. In

 any case, the position of law discussed above showing that, as a

 payee, the respondent no.1 could certainly have filed the

 complaints, demonstrates that there is no substance in the

 aforesaid contention raised on behalf of the applicants.

 the complaint, wherein it was stated that the notice issued by

 respondent no.1 was deemed to have been received by the

 service of notice on the applicants was pleaded and proved by the

 respondent no.1, the offence under <a href="/doc/1440901/" id="a_33">Section 138(c)</a> of the Act was

 that it was stated on behalf of the respondent no.1 that the notice

 was sent on the correct address of the applicants and that it was

 deemed to have been served. It was also on record that

 acknowledgments regarding service of notice were not placed on

 record. But, in order to prove its case, respondent no.1 examined

 CW-2, an official of the postal department. A perusal of the

 evidence of the said witness shows that the notices were served on

 the applicants on 4.3.2004. In this regard the said witness referred

 to official records and emphasized that such documents had

 presumptive value as they were prepared in the ordinary course of

 exhibited, being a letter dated 8.4.2004 received from the office

 of postal department at Bhopal, clearly stating that the notice was

 served on the applicants on 4.3.2004. Since, this document was

 prepared in the ordinary course of business of the postal

 department, there was no reason why it could be doubted. Such

 material was clearly enough to prove service of notice on the

 applicants on 4.3.2004 and since, admittedly, the amounts were

 not paid by the applicants to the respondent no.1 in terms of the

 dishonoured cheques within 15 days from that date, the offence

 was complete under <a href="/doc/1440901/" id="a_34">Section 138(c)</a> of the Act and the complaints

 reported in AIR 1953 SC 468.            In this context perusal of the

 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_39">Section 313</a> statement of the applicant no.2 does not in any

 manner take the case of the applicants any further. In fact, when

 the said applicant was asked as regards the partner of the

 respondent no.1 being empowered to prosecute the complaint, the

 only response the applicant no.2 gave was that he did not know

 about the same. These kind of responses to the questions put

 during the course of recording of statement under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_40">Section 313</a> of

 the Cr.P.C. show that the emphasis placed on this aspect of the

 the respondent no.1 had been made to the Nagpur office from

 which the Bhopal office of applicant no.1 had already split. But,

 defence raised on behalf of the applicants was not proved and

 therefore, in the absence of proof to the contrary, the cheques

 were clearly found to have been issued for discharge of legal debt

 or liability. It is significant that in the present case no argument

 was raised before this Court on the merits of the findings rendered

 by the two courts below and all the arguments concerned only the

 aforesaid issues referred to above, pertaining to alleged defective

 affidavit filed on behalf of respondent no.1, absence of proof of

 service of notice on the applicants and the respondent no.1 not

 having capacity to file the complaint as it could not be said to be a

 legal entity. But, as discussed above the applicants were unable to

 support their contentions.

 the nature of jurisdiction being exercised by this Court while

 findings are found to be perverse or the courts below are found to

 have committed any jurisdictional error. This position has been

 reiterated in a recent judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court,

 relied upon by the learned counsel appearing for the respondent

 no.1, in the case of Bir Sing Vs. Mukesh Kumar                 reported in

 (2019) (4) SCC 197, wherein, while answering the question as

 to whether a revisional court in exercise of its discretionary

 jurisdiction       can interfere with an order of conviction in the

 absence of any jurisdictional error, it was held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                 ''16. It is well settled that in exercise of
                revisional jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_43">Section 482</a>
                of the Criminal Procedure Code, the High
                Court does not, in the absence of
                perversity, upset concurrent factual
                findings. It is not for the Revisional Court
                to re-analyse and re-interpret the
                evidence on record''.
