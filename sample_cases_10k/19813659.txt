             (MANGALSINGH V/s. STATE OF M.P.)
29.11.2017
      Shri Satish Jain, Advocate for the applicant (Mangal
Singh son of Gokul Singh Rajput).
      Shri    Aditya      Garg,    public    prosecutor   for
respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard. Perused the case diary.
</p><p id="p_2">2.    Applicant - Mangal singh son of Gokul Singh
Rajput, has filed this first application for grant of bail
under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Section 438</a> of Cr.P.C. He is
apprehending his arrest in connection with crime
No.236/2017, registered at police station - Khachrod,
Distt. Ujjain (M.P.) for the offence punishable under
Section 34(2) of M.P. Excise Act, 1915.
</p><p id="p_3">3.    As per case diary, the complainant A.S.I. Rajesh
Singh, alleged that on 4.5.2017, when he reached village
Bajari via village Kanchankhedi Bhaisola through the
private vehicle, he received a secret information that the
present applicant with co-accused Dharmendra Singh,
are illegally carrying the liquor boxes in gunny bags for
selling to someone and if raid is carried out, there are
chances of success. Thereafter, the complainant called
the   panch     witness    and    prepared   the   memo   of
 information to the panch witness and thereafter raid was
carried out, but taking benefit of the darkness, both the
accused runaway from the place of occurrence. They
were chased by the complainant and after some
distance, they found number of boxes lying near the
village road. Total 63 bulk litres of country made liquor
has been seized. On the basis of the aforesaid, the
alleged crime number has been registered against the
present applicant - Mangal Singh Rajput and co-accused
Dharmendra Rajput.
</p><p id="p_4">4.   Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted
that the liquor was not seized from the possession of the
applicant. It is a case of false implication and prayed for
grant of anticipatory bail.
</p><p id="p_5">5.   Learned public prosecutor opposed the prayer and
submits that the present applicant is deeply involved in
the alleged offence. Due to darkness, they ran away
from the place of occurrence and prays for rejection of
the anticipatory bail application.
</p><p id="p_6">6.   <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_2">Section 59</a> of the Excise Act, 1915, provides that
the court shall not grant anticipatory bail to the person
accused of offence under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_3">Section 49A</a> of the Act or to
accused found guilty under <a href="/doc/134179606/" id="a_4">Section 34(a)</a> and (b) of the
Act, in respect of the person, who does not hold the
        license under the Act or Rule and has been found in
       possession at the time of detection of more than 50 bulk
       of litres liquor.
</p><p id="p_7">       7.    From the case diary and arguments advanced by
       the learned counsel for the applicant, factually the case
       does not fall within the observation made in para 24 of
       the decision of the Division Bench in the case of
       Naresh Kumar Lahria V/s. State of M.P. &amp; Others,
       reported as 2004(4) M.P.H.T. 205 (DB).
</p><p id="p_8">       8.    On     due    consideration        of         the           facts           and
       circumstances of the case, so also considering the
       material evidence available in the case diary, no case for
       grant of anticipatory bail, as prayed for by the applicant
       is, made out.
</p><p id="p_9">       9.    M.Cr.C.No.20045/2017,      has          no        merit            and       is,
       accordingly, dismissed.
