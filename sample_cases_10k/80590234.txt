                  M.Cr.C. No. 50674/2018
               (Hemant Ojha Vs. State of M.P.)
                            (1)

Gwalior, dated : 21/1/2019
       Shri Akhilesh Gupta, Advocate for the applicant.
       Shri Ravindra Singh, Public Prosecutor for the
respondent-State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">       Case Diary is perused.
</p><p id="p_2">       Learned counsel for the rival parties are heard.
       The applicant has filed this third application under
<a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">section 439</a> of the Cr.P.C. for grant of bail. The first one was
dismissed on merits vide order dated 14/9/18 passed in
M.Cr.C. No.35894/2018, while the second application was
rejected for want of material change in circumstances vide
order dated 14/11/18 passed in M.Cr.C. No.41199/2018.
</p><p id="p_3">       The applicant has been arrested by Police Station
GRP B.G. District Gwalior in connection with Crime
No.270/2016 registered in relation to the offences punishable
under <a href="/doc/329571/" id="a_2">Sections 392</a> of the IPC and 11,13 of the MPDVPK
Act.
</p><p id="p_4">       Prosecution story, in short, is that the complainant
lodged a report to the effect that on 18/11/2016, she was
travelling in Chambal Expresss (Train No. 12177) in S3
coach at Berth No. 57. When she was about to alight at the
Railway Station, Gwalior and her brother and friends went to
unload luggage from the train, one unknown person of fragile
body came, snatched mobile from her hand and ran away
from the spot.
</p><p id="p_5">       Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the
applicant has been falsely implicated. The applicant is in
custody since 2/6/18 and as such has already suffered more
           THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                  M.Cr.C. No. 50674/2018
               (Hemant Ojha Vs. State of M.P.)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            (2)</span>

than six months of custody. Co-accused Gaurav Shama and
Vinod Rathore have been released on bail by this Court vide
orders dated 23/7/18 and 14/8/18 pased in M.Cr.C.
Nos.24051/18 and 31963/18 respectively and the applicant
deserves parity in treatment. Investigation is over and
charge-sheet has been filed. The FIR has been lodged
against unknown person. He is a permanent resident of 7
Laxmi Colony, Dabra, District Gwalior and there is no
likelihood of his absconsion, if released on bail.
</p><p id="p_6">      Learned Public Prosecutor opposed the application
and prayed for its rejection by contending that on the basis of
the allegations and the material available on record, no case
for grant of bail is made out. Attention has also been invited
to the criminal antecedents of the applicant.
</p><p id="p_7">      However, it would not be desirable to enter into the
merits of the rival contentions at this juncture. Considering
the period of custody undergone by the applicant coupled
with the fact that trial is not likely to conclude in near future
and prolonged pre-trial detention being an anathema to the
concept of liberty, this Court is inclined to extend the benefit
of bail to the applicant, though on comparatively stringent
conditions.
</p><p id="p_8">      Accordingly, without expressing any opinion on merits
of the case, this application is allowed and it is directed that
the applicant namely Hemant Ojha be released on bail on
furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.1,00,000/-
(Rupees One Lac only) with two solvent and local sureties

            of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand) each to the
            satisfaction of the trial Court/committal Court for his
            appearance on the dates given by the concerned Court.
</p><p id="p_9">                       This order will remain operative subject to compliance
            of the following conditions by the applicant :-
</p><p id="p_10">             1.       The applicant will comply with all the terms and

</p><p id="p_12">             3.       The applicant will not indulge himself in extending
                      inducement, threat or promise to any person
                      acquainted with the facts of the case so as to
                      dissuade him/her from disclosing such facts to the
                      Court or to the Police Officer, as the case may be;
</p><p id="p_13">             4.       The applicant shall not commit an offence similar to
                      the offence of which he is accused;
</p><p id="p_14">             5.       The applicant will not seek unnecessary
                      adjournments during the trial; and
</p><p id="p_15">             6.       The applicant will not leave India without previous
                      permission of the trial Court/Investigating Officer, as
                      the case may be.

            compliance.
