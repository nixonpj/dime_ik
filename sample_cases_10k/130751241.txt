</p><p id="p_2">  2. The plaintiff filed an application under order 12 Rule 6 CPC  under

     the defendants  in the WS as such the plaintiff is entitled to a decree 
     of possession and mesne profits on such admissions.   In order to 
     adjudicate upon the application filed by the plaintiff it is necessary 
     to  elucidate the pleadings of the parties. 
</p><p id="p_3">  3.  The plaintiff has filed the present suit on the averrments that he is 
     the owner /landlord of the property   No. F25, Laj Pat Nagar­ I New

   Delhi. It is alleged that defendants who are  husband and wife were 
   jointly inducted as tenants in the entire second floor of the above 
   property,   comprising   drawing   cum   dinning   room,   one   bed   room, 
   toilets &amp;  kitchen and Balcony on both sides and a varrendah (herein 
   after referred to as suit property).  It is further averred that  initially 
   the   suit   premises   was   let   out   for   11   months   commencing   from 
   01.08.2011 vide rent agreement dated 03.08.2011 at a monthly rent of 
   Rs.   22,000/­.   After   expiry   of   the   tenancy   on   30.06.2012     it   was 
   extended for another 11 months  commencing from 01.07.2012 vide 
   registered   lease   deed   dated   26.06.2012   at   a   monthly   rent   of   Rs.
   25,000/­ per month inclusive of water and electricity charges.   
</p><p id="p_4">4. It is also alleged that  despite repeated requests the defendant failed 
   to pay the agreed rent   as such the   lease   stood         automatically 
   determined as per  clause 15 of  terms  and conditions of the lease 
   agreement  which  provides  that  if defendant failed to pay monthly 
   rent regularly for 2 months, the tenancy would automatically stood 
   terminated.   However,   by   way   of     abandoned   precaution,   plaintiff 
   terminated   the   tenancy   of   defendant   vide   legal     notice   dated 
   05.10.2012   calling   upon   the   defendants   to     hand   over   the   vacant 
   possession of   suit   premises by the end of   October 2012 and pay 
   arrears  of   rent  @   Rs.  25,000/­  per   month.     It   is  also     alleged  that 
   defendants are liable to  pay  damages @ Rs.45,000/­ per month  i.e. 
   from     01.11.2012   after the expiry of the period of legal notice, as 
   they have failed to  vacate the suit premises though defendants paid 
   rent of Rs.   75,000/­ for the period   August to October 2012 @ Rs.
   25,000/­ per month. 
</p><p id="p_5">5. It   is   further   alleged   that   defendants   filed     separate   written 
   statements and made following admissions:­
   The   defendant No. 1, admitted that the plaintiff is the owner and 
   landlord   of   the   premises.   It   has   also   been     admitted   that   the 
   defendants  being  husband &amp; wife, they were jointly inducted as a 
   tenant in the suit premises.  The defendant No. 1 also admitted that 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            3</span>

   the said premises was leased out under Lease Deed dated 26.06.2012 
   at the monthly rent of Rs. 25,000/­ per month.  The defendant No. 1 
   has further admitted the receipt of the legal notice dated 05.10.2012 
   sent   by   the   Plaintiff     and   he   replied     to   same   vide   reply   dated 
   27.10.12 admitting that the rent  for 3 months was due and paid the 
   same vide Cheque No. 057421 of Rs.  75,000/­ dated 27.10.2012.  
     Similarly, the Defendant No. 2 in her written statement admitted 
   that the Plaintiff is the owner and landlord of the premises. The lease 
   deed dated 26.06.2012 is also admitted. It is also admitted that she 
   received the notice of termination dated 05.10.2012. 
</p><p id="p_6">6.   It is stated that the suit   in recovery of possession, plaintiff has to 
   prove   that he is land lord/ owner of the premises which was let out. 
   The tenancy has been terminated by   notice under <a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_1">section 106</a>   of 
   Transfer   of   Property   Act   and     the   rate   of   rent   is     more   than   Rs. 
   3,500/­ per month. 
</p><p id="p_7">7.  It is stated that it is an  admitted case  of parties  that the plaintiff is 
   the owner/ land lord of the suit premises.   The agreement is also 
   admitted and it is   also admitted that the defendants   received the 
   legal notice, rate of rent is also admitted, as such the parties need 
   not to go  to trial.
</p><p id="p_8">8.  It is further alleged that plaintiff is claiming damages @  Rs. 25,000/­ 
   per   month   which   is     an   admitted   fact,   as   such     no   evidence     is 
   required even on the quantum of damages being Rs. 25,000/­  with 
   effect from 01.11.2012.  It is prayed that judgments on admissions be 
   passed as prayed for . 
</p><p id="p_9">9.   Defendant   No.   1   did   not   file   reply   to   the   application.   It   was 
   submitted on behalf of the defendant No. 1 that he had vacated the 
   suit premises on 01.07.2012 and  defendant No. 2 was occupying the 
   same.
</p><p id="p_10">10.  Reply   to   the     application     has   been   filed   by   defendant   No.   2 
   opposing  it on the ground that  it is an abuse of process of law. It is 
   also stated that plaintiff has no cause of action. It is further stated 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                              4</span>

   that   the plaintiff and defendant No.1 have filed a collusive suit to 
   evict   defendant   No.2   as   there   is   matrimonial   dispute   between 
   defendant   No.1   &amp;   2.     It   is   further     stated   that   the   lease     dated 
   26.06.2012 was for  eleven months  with effect from 01.07.2012, but 
   suit was filed before the expiry of the lease   as such the suit is pre 
   mature. It is also   stated that   the lease deed is   a sham document 
   and is   forged and fabricated. It is not   denied that the defendants 
   are   husband   and   wife     but   it   was     denied   that   defendants   were 
   jointly   inducted as tenant.   It is stated that defendant  No.2   was 
   made to  sign certain documents by defendant No. 1 in the fiduciary 
   capacity.   It   is   further   alleged   that   defendant   No.   1     obtained   the 
   signatures of defendant No.2 on the pretext that they   were for the 
   benefit of  herself and their child and  she  (defendant No. 2) signed 
   the same being the wife of defendant No.1. The rent agreement   was 
   denied   so   was   the   rate   of   rent.     It   is   also   stated   that   as   plaintiff 
   received rent after  the  issuance of   legal notice,  it amounts to  the 
   waiver of the legal notice.   It was denied that there are  unequivocal 
   admissions by defendant No.2 which entitle the plaintiff to a decree. 
</p><p id="p_11">11. I have heard Ld. Counsel for  parties and perused the record. 
</p><p id="p_12">12.   Order 12 rule 6 CPC which relates to judgment on admission, is as 
   follows:­
   R.6.   Judgment   on   admissions.­­(1)  Where   admissions   of   fact   have  
   been made either in the pleading or otherwise, whether orally or in  
   writing   the   Court   may   at   any   stage   of   the   suit,   either   on   the  
   application of any party or of its own motion and without waiting for  
   the determination of any other question between the parties, make 
   such order or give such judgment as it may think fit, having regard to  
   such admissions. 
</p><p id="p_13">   (2) Whenever a judgment is pronounced under sub­rule (1) a decree  
   shall be drawn up in accordance with the judgment and the decree 
   shall bear the date on which the judgment was pronounced. 
</p><p id="p_14">13. For passing of a judgment on admission, the admissions required to 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                           5</span>

   have been made  by the defendant  should be  admitting :­
</p><p id="p_15">   (i) Land Lord and Tenant Relationship.
</p><p id="p_16">   (ii) Rent of property being above Rs. 3,500/­
</p><p id="p_17">   (iii) Valid termination of tenancy. 
</p><p id="p_18">14.     The object of order 12 rule 6 CPC is to give the plaintiff a right to 
   the speedy judgment, under this rule a party on admission of  other 
   party can  press for judgment.  Though Court retains its  discretion. 
</p><p id="p_19">15. The contention of Ld. Counsel for defendant No. 2 is that  judgment 
   on   admissions   cannot   be   made   in   the   absence   of   unequivocal 
   admissions. 
</p><p id="p_20">16.In this regard it has been held in    Charanjit Singh Vs. Kehar Singh, 
   2006 V AD (Delhi) 66, by Hon'ble High Court of  Delhi that: 
     "Written   statement   has   to   be   read   and   construed   as   composite  
   document   and   court   cannot   pick   up   a   single   line   and   treat   it   as  
   admission out of context in which it is written. The essential feature  
   of admission is that it should be 'concise and deliberate act'. It must  
   not be something which was not intended and was not the intention  
   of   the   party.   Pre­requisites   to   admissions   are   unconditional,  
   unambiguous and intend the same  to be read as admissions."
</p><p id="p_21">17. Thus,  in view of the above judgment the whole Written Statement 
   has to be perused to see whether there are admissions on part of the 
   defendant.   
</p><p id="p_22">18.  In  order to invoke the provisions of Order 12 Rule 6 CPC,  the Court 
   has to scrutinize the pleadings in totality   and ignore evasive and 
   unspecific denial either as to relationship or as to service of notice or 
   as to the nature of tenancy, as held in Pooja Aggarwal Vs. Sakata Inx 
   (India) Ltd., 2008 X 10 AD (Delhi) 846. 
</p><p id="p_23">19.   The contention of defendant No. 1 is  that he had vacated the suit 
   premises  on 01.07.2012. It is also  contended on  behalf of defendant 
   No.1 that he   informed the plaintiff that he vacated the suit premises 
   on 01.07.12  in his reply to the legal notice.  It was  also contended 
   that   defendant   No.   1   had   cleared     the   outstanding     rent   w.e.f. 
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                               6</span>

<p id="p_24">      01.07.2011   to   30.10.2012   as   such   the   suit   was   not   maintainable 
      against the defendant No.1. It was further alleged that the defendant 
      No. 2 was in possession of the suit premises. 
</p><p id="p_25">20. In  my view the contention of  defendant No. 2, that  she was made 
      to  sign some blank papers   by defendant No. 1 on the pretext that 
      they were for her  benefit as well as the  benefit of her child  is of no 
      consequences as   she being   an educated lady ought to know   the 
      consequences of signing   blank papers.   Moreover, she (defendant 
      No.2)     has   not     filed   any   suit   for   cancellation   of   the   said   lease 
      agreement   allegedly being forged and fabricated as   such the said 
      contention  in my view are  without merits. 
</p><p id="p_26">21. As regards the relationship of land lord and tenant , defendant No.1 
      did  not     deny   the   same,          defendant       No. 2   stated       that     suit 
      premises were taken on rent by  defendant No.1 for defendant No. 2 
      his wife   and child and rent was being paid by defendant No.1 as 
      such there is no   specific denial of land lord/ tenant relationship by 
      defendant No. 2 also,  the rent deed is signed by  both the defendants 
      as such the land lord/ tenant relationship between the parties   is 
      admitted.   As   regard   the   rate   of   rent   also     being   Rs.     25,000/­ 
      defendant   No.1     admitted   the   same   in   para   4   of  WS   on   merits. 
      Defendant  No. 2 made evasive denial,   of the same, however, she 
      admitted   her   signatures   on   the   lease   deed   which   is   a   registered 
      documents,   as such the rate of rent being above Rs. 3,500/­ is not 
      disputed, the suit premises thus, do not fall within the purview of 
      <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_2">Delhi Rent Control Act</a>. 
</p><p id="p_27">22.            Ld.   Counsel   for   defendant   No.   2     stated   that     the   lease 
      agreement was for a period of  11 months but the suit has been filed 
      prior  to  the  expiry  of the  said  lease  deed  as  such  the  suit  is    pre 
      mature.   In this regard it is pertinent to note that <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_3">Section 107</a> of the 
      Transfer of  Property Act  provides that lease of immovable property 
      from   year   to   year   can   only   be   made   by   a   registered   instrument. 
      <a href="/doc/1945567/" id="a_4">Section 71</a> (1) (d) of the   <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_5">Registration Act</a> makes  it is mandatory

      that lease deed is to be   registered in case   of a lease   for   one 
      year   or   more,    and   <a href="/doc/1768154/" id="a_6">Section   49</a>   of   the   Registration   Act   bars     the

</p><p id="p_28">23.            The   lease   agreement   between   the     parties     is     a   registered 
      documents,    clause   15 of which   provides   termination of lease in 
      case the rent is not paid  regularly for two months,  lease deed would 
      stand     automatically   determined.   Ld.   Counsel   for     plaintiff 
      contended that   in  view of   Clause   15,    as there    was   default in 
      payment   of     rent,   the   lease         deed       stood     automatically 
      determined,  as such the contentions of  defendant No. 2  is without 
      any merits. 
</p><p id="p_29">24.        As regards the service of legal notice, defendant No. 1 admitted 
      the     receipt of notice,   the   defendant No. 2 did not         specifically 
      deny the service of legal notice.  Even if, it is,  assumed  for the sake 
      of   arguments     that   legal   notice   was     not   served   on 
      defendant No.2,    although there is no  specific denial of the same, 
      in that case the tenancy     stood   determined by filing of the suit as 
      held       in  M/s     Jeewan   Diesels   &amp;     Electricals   Ltd. Vs.    Jasbir   Singh  
      Chadha     (HUF)  &amp;    Another 183,   2011    DLT    712.  Thus    in  my 
      view   the     tenancy   was     duly   terminated   vide   legal   notice   dated 
      05.10.2013.
</p><p id="p_30">25.      It is further contended by defendant No. 2 that there was  waiver 
      of legal notice as the plaintiff has accepted the rent after the service 
      of legal notice is without  any merits as waiver  can  be  considered 
      only   if   some   act   is     done   by   the     person   giving   notice   showing 
      intention to treat  lease as continued. 
</p><p id="p_31">26.      <a href="/doc/756924/" id="a_9">Section 113</a> of Transfer Property  Act provides  "that  a notice 
      given under <a href="/doc/1134872/" id="a_10">section 111</a>, clause (h), is waived, with the express or  
      implied consent of the person to whom it is given, by any act on

  the part of the person giving it showing an intention to treat the  
  lease as subsisting".  
</p><p id="p_32">27.  Thus, according to 113 of <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_11">Transfer of Property Act</a>, notice given 
  under <a href="/doc/1134872/" id="a_12">section 111</a> (h) of the Act may be treated as having been

</p><p id="p_35">29.          In my view the contention of Ld. Counsel for defendant 
    No.2  that as the plaintiff has  accepted the rent  after service of 
    legal notice, as such, there was waiver of notice,  is meritless, as 
    mere   acceptance   of   rent   after   the   notice     cannot   be   a 
    determinative   factor.   The   landlord   is   entitled   to   use   and 
    occupation charges of the premises from the tenant/defendant 
    till he vacates the suit premises.  In this regard it has been held 
    further  in  "Sarup Singh  (SUPRA) as follows: 
</p><p id="p_36">     "that receipt of rent after termination of tenancy can be taken as 
    charges towards use and occupation because after all a tenant is  
    bound to pay charges till he vacates the tenanted premises."
</p><p id="p_37">30.  Thus   as   there   is   no   written     notice   given   to   defendant     No.2   to 
    plaintiff   to   renew   the   tenancy,   the   contention   of     defendant   that 
    acceptance of rent after  the determination of tenancy was waiver of 
    notice   is   rejected.  The   payment   made     by   defendants   to   plaintiff 
    after   the   termination   of   tenancy   would   not   amount   to   waiver   of 
    notice  as there  is    no  express or    implied  consent  by plaintiff   to 
    waive the notice and in fact the filing of the present suit  shows the 
    intention of plaintiff not to continue the  defendants as tenants.  
</p><p id="p_38">31.  In  the   present   case   admittedly     there   is   a     registered   lease   deed 
    executed between the parties and  after the expiry of the lease deed 
    dated 26.06.2012 and notice sent for  termination of tenancy,  there 
    exists  no subsisting tenancy. Thus, on the basis of pleadings of the 
    parties   and     provisions   under   order   12   rule   6     CPC,   <a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_15">Section   106</a>, 
    <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_16">Section 107</a>, <a href="/doc/756924/" id="a_17">Section 113</a> of Transfer of Property Act, <a href="/doc/181916/" id="a_18">Section 17</a>   (1) 
</p><p id="p_39">    (d) and 49 of the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_19">Registration Act</a>,   as well as taking   stock of the 
    submissions and  rival submission, defendants were inducted  in the 
    suit   premises   by   the   plaintiff   vide   a   registered   lease     deed   dated 
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                              10</span>

     26.12.2012 which was terminated  vide legal notice dated 05.10.2012. 
     Admittedly the monthly rent of the suit property was more than Rs. 
     3,500/­   as such the   provisions of <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_20">Delhi Rent Control Act</a> are not 
     applicable. 
</p><p id="p_40">  32.  Fore   the   foregoing   reasons   plaintiff   is   entitled   to   judgment   on 
     admissions. The application under order 12 rule 6 CPC,   is   thus, 
     allowed,   the   suit   of   plaintiff   for   possession   in   respect   of   the   suit 
     property     is   decreed     in   favour   of   the   plaintiff   and   against   the 
     defendant   comprising   of   entire   IInd   Floor   of   property   No.     F   25 
     Lajpat  Nagar  I, New Delhi, drawing cum  dinning  room,   one  bed 
     room, two toilets, Kitchen  &amp; balcony on both the sides. Decree sheet 
     be prepared.   Defendants   are granted one months time from the 
     date of order to hand over the vacant and peaceful possession of the 
     suit premises to the plaintiff.   
</p><p id="p_41">  33. As far as the prayer for recovery and  damages are concerned it is a 
     matter   of   trial     as   there   are   no   admissions   in   this   regard     by   the 
     defendants.   Defendant   No.  1  has   alleged   that   he   vacated   the  suit 
     premises on 01.07.2012 as such he is not liable to  pay the damages. 
     The   contention of plaintiff is that both the   defendants are joint 
     tenants   and   thus   they   are   jointly   liable   to   pay   the   damages. 
     Defendant No. 2 also not specifically admitted default in payments 
     of rent. She has further stated that it was defendant No. 1 who shall 
     be liable  to pay the rent. Thus, the proceedings would continue for 
     the said purpose.
