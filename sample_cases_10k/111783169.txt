Present:-   Mr. Chandandeep Singh, Advocate
            with Mr.Sahil Abhi, Advocate
            for the appellant.
</p><p id="p_2">            None for respondent no.1.

Amol Rattan Singh, J (Oral)

             In this appeal filed by the Insurance Company that had insured

the vehicle in question, i.e. an Activa scooter bearing registration no.HR-51-

AQ-5554, the essential challenge is to the calculations made by the Motor

Accident Claims Tribunal, Faridabad (in short "the Tribunal"), vide the

impugned Award dated 07.05.2015, inasmuch as, though firstly it has been

admitted in the claim petition itself that the claimant (respondent herein)

who had suffered injuries in the accident, had already received a sum of

Rs.2,49,990/- by way of reimbursement of the medical expenses incurred by

him, from the company to which he had subscribed for a medical health

insurance policy, i.e. TPA Vipul Medical Corporation, yet, the Tribunal in

its Award, after having noticed the aforesaid fact as regards the bills Exs.P-

1 and P-2, in paragraph 26 of its Award has calculated the total amount of

the bills, Exs. P-3, P-4, P-8, P-9 and P-12, P-18 to P-21, to be Rs.4,45,000/-

which includes (as contained in the aforesaid paragraph) a sum of
                               1 of 3
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">            ::: Downloaded on - 19-08-2018 07:29:23 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> FAO no.5923 of 2015                                                        2</span>

Rs.1,29,697/- (rounded off to Rs.1,30,000/-) separately calculated as regards

the bills Exs.P-18 to P-21, which actually is a wrong calculation shown, as

the total amount of the said bills (Exs.P18 to P21) is only Rs.1471.55.

</p><p id="p_4">             Learned counsel for the appellant-Insurance Company has

taken me through the record of evidence before the Tribunal, in which,

firstly, in paragraph 13 of the claim petition, respondent no.1 herein

admitted to having received Rs.2,49,990/-, as noticed herein above, from the

medical insurance company and secondly, calculation of the total sum of all

the bills as were led by way of evidence before the Tribunal, i.e. Exs.P-1 to

P-4, P-8, P-9, P-12, P-18 to P-21, amounts to Rs.4,29,457.65 (rounded off to

Rs.4,29,458/-) of which, as already noticed, the claimant admitted to have

got reimbursed Rs.2,49,990/-.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             Thus, only Rs.1,79,467/- actually remain to be reimbursed to

him for the medical expenses incurred by him for treatment of the injuries

received by him in the accident in question.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             Further, it is seen that other than for costs of medicines and

medical treatment, the Tribunal awarded Rs.10,000/- for pain and suffering

and special diet, Rs.5000/- for transportation and Rs.12,000/- towards loss

of income, i.e. a total of Rs.27,000/- under heads other than those for costs

of medical treatment.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             If Rs.27,000/- are added to the actual amount spent on medical

treatment, i.e. to Rs.4,29,458/-, the total comes to Rs.4,56,458/-.

</p><p id="p_8">             Of the aforesaid total sum, Rs.2,49,990/- already having been

reimbursed to respondent no.1-claimant, by his medical insurance company,

what would remain to be paid to him from the total compensation, would be

Rs.2,06,468/-.

              The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent.
</p>
<p id="p_11">              It is to be noticed here that, despite service, respondent no.1

has not contested the appeal at all, not even putting in an appearance once in

the past about two years.
