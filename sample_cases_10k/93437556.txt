                                The challenge in the present writ petition is to an order dated

           21.05.2013 whereby the approval to the resolution passed by the Panchayat

           dated 19.08.1969 and 22.09.2002 for exchange for the land measuring 7

           Kanal 3 Marla was given on payment of Rs.52,37,500/- and also subject to

           surrender of excess land measuring 3 Kanal 6 Marlas and 17 sq. yards to the

           Gram Panchayat with a further direction to the Panchayat to provide two

           karam wide passage to the fields of the respondent No. 7 out of the said land

           measuring 3 Kanal 6 Marla and 17 sq. yards.

           land was to be exchanged with the land measuring 7 Kanal 3 Marla of Chahi

           land of the petitioner for the purpose of establishing school. Such resolution

           was necessitated for the reason that High Tension Transmission Line was

           over the land owned by Panchayat and Panchayat was not able to construct a

           school building as the permission to raise construction of the school building

           was declined.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                               Keeping in view the necessity of establishing a school and the

           availability of alternative land of the petitioner, the exchange was restored

           by taking into consideration that as per the Consolidation Index the rate of

           land of the petitioner is Rs.1 per acre as against the land of Gram Panchayat

           the value of which was Rs.0.25p per acre being Barani. The school was

           constructed soon thereafter in the land earlier owned by the petitioner but

           without awaiting approval from the State Government.

</p><p id="p_4">                               A writ petition was filed by respondent No.7 before this Court

           challenging exchange affected by Gram Panchayat bearing CWP No.10824

           of 2011 titled as 'Balinder Kumar Vs. State of Haryana and others'. A

           direction was issued to the Secretary, Rural Development and Panchayat,

           Haryana to consider the approval of exchange and also the provision of a

           path to the land owned by respondent No.7 herein. It is in pursuance of such

           direction the impugned order has been passed wherein, the learned Financial

           Commissioner has taken into consideration the Collector's rate to return a

           finding that the excess land of the Gram Panchayat has been exchanged in

           with the land owned by the petitioner and therefore, the approval of land

           measuring 7 Kanal 3 Marlas was given on payment of Rs.52,37,500/- but

           also further directing to hand over possession of excess land measuring 3

           Kanal 6 Marla and 17 sq. yards out of which passage was directed to be

           provided by the Gram Panchayat.

                               We have heard learned counsel for the parties and find that

           direction of the Financial Commissioner to pay a sum of Rs.52,37,500/- for

           exchange of land measuring 7 Kanal 3 Marla at this stage is wholly

           unjustified and untenable. The petitioner stated before this Court that he is

           ready and willing to undo the entire exchange and take the possession of the

           land measuring 7 Kanal 3 Marla so as to restore pre-1969 position in order

           to show his bona fides, but learned Deputy Advocate General rightly

           expressed inability of the State Government to accede to such request for the

           reason that school has been constructed which has since been upgraded up to

           Class 10+2, therefore it will not be in the interest of the students to undo the

           exchange process.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                               The learned Financial Commissioner has not given any reason

           to dispute the valuation given in the resolution of the Panchayat finding that

           the land of the Panchayat is Barani i.e. uncultivable as against the land of

           the petitioner which was a cultivable land. The valuation of the land of the

           petitioner was Rs.1 per acre as against Rs.0.25p per acre valuation of the

           land of the Gram Panchayat. Therefore, the variation in the area of the land

           has been explained in the resolution of the Gram Panchayat but without

           adverting to the valuation of the land and finding it unjustified in any

           manner of the Collector's rates in the year 2013 to demand over Rs.52 lakhs

           from the petitioner seems to be wholly unjustified. Consequently that part of

           the order approving exchange of land measuring 7 Kanals 3 marlas in lieu of

           payment of Rs.52,37,500/- is set aside being unjustified. Since, the valuation

           at the time of exchange has not been disputed in any plausible manner,

           therefore, the order to return land measuring 3 Kanal 6 Marla and 17 sq.

           yards cannot be sustained. The said part of the order is also set aside.

                               Learned counsel for the petitioner has no objection if
