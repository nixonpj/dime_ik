                       AT CHANDIGARH

                                           C.W.P. No. 4322 of 2007.

District Ludhiana, and another.                             ...Respondents.</pre>


<p id="p_1">CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH.


</p><pre id="pre_2">Present:    Mr. S.S. Chauhan, Advocate,
            for the petitioners.

            Mr. Arun Palli, Senior Advocate, with
            Mr. Jai Bhagwan, Advocate,
            for the respondent No. 1.


AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH, J. (ORAL).


</pre><p id="p_2">            In the present writ petition, the challenge is to the order of the

Labour Court dated 19.01.2007 (Annexure-P-3), wherein an application

moved by the petitioners under <a href="/doc/1367207/" id="a_1">Section 36(2)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act

has been rejected on the ground that there is an implied consent granted to

the authorised representative.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            Counsel for the petitioner contends that the impugned order

dated 18.10.2000 cannot be sustained in the light of the Full Bench Judgment

of this Court in the case of Indrasan Parsad Versus Presiding Officer and

another, 2008(1) S.C.T. 522, wherein this Court has held that the consent of

the party must be specific and so has to be the leave by the Court and it

should be at the beginning of the proceedings so that there remains no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> C.W.P. No. 4322 of 2007.                                                   -2-</span>



ambiguity in the status of the legal practitioner who appears after due

consent and leave. It has further been held that the implied consent of the

party or implied leave of the Court are alien to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1280894/" id="a_2">Section 36</a>

(4) of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_3">Industrial Disputes Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             Counsel for the respondent No. 1 contends that the objections,

if any, should have been taken by the petitioners when the legal practitioner

has put in appearance on 18.10.2000 before the Labour Court in the capacity

of an authorised representative of the respondent No. 1. He further contends

that Mr. B.P. Bansal and Associates are the Legal Secretaries of Ludhiana

Commercial Undertakings and Establishments Association (Regd.), copy of

certificate of registration is appended as Annexure-R-3 with the reply filed

by the respondent No. 1. He further contends that a specific stand has been

taken before the Labour Court that the authorised representative therein had

never practised in the Civil Courts and therefore, was exclusively working in

the Labour Court, Labour Offices and Labour Tribunal. Counsel for the

respondent No. 1 relies upon Constitution of Ludhiana Commercial

Undertakings and Establishments Association (Regd.)(Annexure-R-2).

According to Clause 'D' thereof the functions of the Legal Secretary have

been mentioned which are reproduced herein below :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "D.   Legal Secretary :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                   The    Legal   Secretary   shall   have   charge   of    all
             correspondence. He shall keep accounts of the assets, credits
             and liabilities of the federation. He shall collect all dues and
             grant receipts. He shall institute, prosecute and defend suits
             and other proceedings in Labour Office, Labour Court, Labour
             Tribunal or in any court of law or elsewhere in arbitration
             proceedings on behalf of the federation or the members or any
             other person who shall be member of an association affiliated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> C.W.P. No. 4322 of 2007.                                                  -3-</span>



            to the federation. He shall be the permanent office bearer. Sh.
            B.P. Bansal s/o Sh. M.R. Bansal, 293-L Model Town, Ludhiana,
            shall be the Legal Secretary of the Federation."</blockquote><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">            He on this basis submits that although the authorised

representative of the respondent No. 1 holds licence under the <a href="/doc/262262/" id="a_4">Advocates

Act</a> and is also a member of the District Bar Association, Ludhiana, but in

the light of the fact that he is not practising in any court of law as is the

specific stand of the respondent No. 1 which has not been controverted by

the petitioners, he would not fall within the ambit of <a href="/doc/1560826/" id="a_5">Section 36(4)</a> of the

Industrial Disputes Act.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            This contention of counsel for the petitioner that he would not

fall within the ambit of <a href="/doc/1560826/" id="a_6">Section 36(4)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, cannot

be accepted in the light of the fact that authorised representative of the

respondent No. 1, who is holding a licence under the <a href="/doc/262262/" id="a_7">Advocates Act</a> and is

also a member of the District Bar Association, Ludhiana.            The only

submission, therefore, which needs to be considered is as to whether there

can be an implied consent in the absence of a specific consent given by the

petitioner or the specific leave granted by the Court. This contention being

covered by the Full Bench Judgment of this Court in Indrasan Parsad's

case (supra), the same deserves to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            In the light of the above, the present writ petition is allowed and

the impugned order dated 19.01.2007 (Annexure-P-3), passed by the Labour

Court, Ludhiana, is hereby set aside.
