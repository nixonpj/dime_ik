         from 58 to 60 years at par with the retiring age of

         decision of respondent No.1 is under challenge before

         the petition contending inter alia that the Gujarat
         Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 2002 are applicable to
         the employees of the State Government only, and could
         not   be      made       applicable              to      the     employees             of     the

         the said respondent, and therefore, the petition is

         affidavit-in-reply stating inter alia that governing
         body of the respondent No.3 though had recommended to
         increase the retirement age from 58 to 60 years, the
         said     proposal             was     not         accepted           by      the        Finance
         Department vide the letter dated 28.03.2013 (Annexure
         'G').       Thereafter, the subject matter was again put
         forward to the Finance Department for reconsideration,
         however, the respondent No.3 had received the reply as
         per letter dated 07.10.2013 stating inter alia that
         proposal for the amendment of the said Rules was not
         approved by the Finance Department of the Government
         of Gujarat.           It is also contended that the said Rules
         of 1980 are binding to the respondent Bureau along
         with the policies, notifications and circulars of the
         State       of     Gujarat           and         any      change,           amendment               or

         Government of Gujarat.

         advocate Mr. Nikhil S. Kariel for the petitioners that
         the respondent No.1 - State having increased the age
         of superannuation of its Class-IV employees from 58 to
         60 years as per the Gujarat Civil Services (Pension)
         Rules,       2002,        there          is      no       justification              for       the
         Government in Finance Department not to accept the
         proposal of the respondent - Bureau to make necessary
         amendment in the Rules of 1980 for increasing the age
         of     superannuation               of        Class-IV           employees             of      the

                    C/SCA/8668/2014                                                            ORDER




         the Finance Department has not stated any reason for
         not accepting the proposed amendment in the said Rules
         of 1980. The learned AGP Ms. Vrunda Shah has submitted
         that    the    matter            of    fixation                of     superannuation                age
         being policy matter involving financial implication,
         this Court should not interfere with the same.
</p>

<p id="p_6">         6.     Having      regard             to      the        submissions              made       by     the
         learned advocates for the parties, it appears that the
         petitioners          have             sought             directions               against           the
         respondent - State to approve the amendment in the
         service       Rules         of    1980            by        increasing             the       age         of
         superannuation of Class-IV employees of the respondent
         No.3 from 58 to 60 years. Apart from the fact that no
         such mandatory directions could be given to the State
         Government         by        the            High          Court           exercising               writ
         jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
         India,     which        otherwise                 would          have        huge        financial
         implication, it is for the State Government to take
         policy        decision            as             to         what         should            be       the
         superannuation              age             of           the        employees             of        its
         organization i.e. the respondent No.3.                                               As per the
         settled legal position, such decisions being policy
         matters,      the      Courts          should             not        interfere           with       the

         increasing the age of superannuation of its employees
         from 58 to 60 years on the ground that the posts of
         Class-IV employees are being abolished gradually, and
         the    services        provided        by        the     Class-IV          are       to        be

         employees of the State Government, the petitioners are
         bound by the Rules of 1980 applicable to them. The
