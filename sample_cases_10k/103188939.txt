<p id="p_26">     6.     While  elaborating  her  arguments  Mrs. Mulekar submitted that 





     the Contract did not provide for payment of interest on the R.A. Bills 

     on the grounds that the said payment was released belatedly. No such 

     claim was ever made by the Contractor. The Contractor did not point 





     out   that   on   account   of   R.A.Bills   being   released   belatedly   it   had   to 

     obtain   a   bridge   loan   and   paid   interest   to   the   bankers   on   such   an 

     amount. She further submitted that the reliance of the Arbitrators on 

     Clause 31.2 in granting interest on the R.A. Bills was a blatant error 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                          ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 16:28:40 :::</span>

     thus   amounting   to   misconduct.   She   further   submitted   that   even 




                                                         
     otherwise interest at the rate of 18 % per annum was exorbitant and 

     there is no justification given as to why the Arbitrators thought it fit to 




                                                        
     grant simple interest at this high rate, more so, when there was no 

     evidence before the Arbitrators regarding the rate of interest charged 




                                          
     by the banks on the lendings at the relevant time. Regarding the simple 
                         
     interest at the rate of 12% p.a. for the pre-reference period on claim 

     Nos.1 and 2, Mrs. Mulekar while pointing to clause 34 of the Contract 
                        
     also submitted that no notice was issued by the Contractor as required 

     under <a href="/doc/1147343/" id="a_4">Section 3(1)(b)</a> of the Interest Act, 1978. She also contended 
      


     that the claimant had not claimed and Claim No.3 did not contemplate 
   



     payment of interest for the pre-reference period on claim Nos.1 and 2 

     i.e.     the   amounts   (B)   and   (Q).   Regarding   interest   on   interest   i.e. 





     Rs.3,57,000/- (Y) charged on interest amount of Rs.10,81,000/- (X), it 

     was submitted that the law does not permit the Arbitrators to allow 

     interest   on   interest   and   therefore   the   Arbitrators   misconducted 





     themselves. She referred, in this regard, to the scheme of <a href="/doc/1390397/" id="a_5">Section 3(3)</a>

     Precisely for the aforesaid reasons, the erroneous application of

     rendering the award as invalid. It is necessary, however, to put a 
     note of caution that in the anxiety to render justice to the party 
     to   arbitration,   the   court   should   not   reappraise   the   evidence 
     intrinsically   with   a   close   scrutiny   for   finding   out   that   the

     power which can be exercised by an appellate court with power 
     to reverse the finding of fact, is alien to the scope and ambit of

     weighing the various possible viewpoints, the interference with 
     the award based on erroneous application of legal principle, the 
     award could not have been made, such award is liable to be set 
      


     aside by holding that there has been a legal misconduct on the 
   



     part  of   the   arbitrator.   In   ultimate   analysis,   it   is   a   question   of 
     delicate balancing between the permissible limit of error of law 
     and   fact   and   patently   erroneous   finding   easily   demonstrable 
     from the materials on record and application of principle of law 





     forming the basis of the award which is patently erroneous."

     different view could ;have been taken and the arbitrators have 
     failed to consider the documents and materials on record in their 
     proper perspective, the award is not liable to be struck down in 





     view   of   the   judicial   decisions   referred   to   hereinbefore.   Error 
     apparent on the face of the record does not mean that on closer 
     scrutiny of the import of documents and materials on record, the 
     finding   made   by   the   arbitrator   may   be   held   to   be   erroneous. 
     Judicial decision over the decades have indicated that an error 
     of   law   or   fact   committed   by   an   arbitrator   by   itself   does   not 
     constitute misconduct warranting interference with the award."

     granted an amount of Rs.21,20,000/- (B) by way of interest at 12% 
                         
     p.a. on the amount of Rs.59,77,000/-, which was claimed by way of

     Rs.3,66,000/- (C) has been granted by way of interest at 12% on claim 

     of escalation for fuel and lubricant i.e. Rs.8,06,000/-.

     satisfied that the challenge to the award of interest at 18&amp; p.a. cannot 





     be termed as a misconduct by the Arbitrators. So far as the interest 

     granted for the post award period is concerned, it is well settled that
