SURYA KANT J. (ORAL)


(1).               The petitioner is a daughter of an employee of the Punjab

                   &amp; Haryana High Court.          She seeks a direction for her

                   admission in the BA.LLB Five-Year Integrated Course in

                   the Kurukshetra University by treating her at par with

                   those whose parents are employees of the Haryana

                   Government.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> CWP No.12090 of 2011.doc                                            -2-</span><p id="p_7">




(2).               During the course of hearing, it transpired that the

                   employees working on the establishment of the High

                   Court and undoubtedly discharging duties in relation to

                   the affairs of the States of Punjab, Haryana and UT

                   Chandigarh, are not being considered at par with the

                   employees of the respective States/UT for the purpose of

                   admissions or other incidental benefits.     It was in this

                   backdrop that this Court on September 26, 2011 passed

                   the following order:-
</p>
<p id="p_8">                           "Counsel for the State of Haryana submits, on

                  instructions, that the State Government has decided

                  to grant equivalence to High Court Employees with

                  employees of the Government of India posted in

                  Chandigarh or in Haryana in connection with the

                  affairs of the Haryana Government.         It is further

                  submitted that High Court employees shall be entitled

                  to draw benefits at one place/State.

</p><p id="p_9">                           Counsel for the State of Haryana prays for time

                  to file an appropriate affidavit appending the detailed

                  decision."
</p>
<p id="p_10">(3).               Thereafter on 12th October, 2011, following order was

                   passed:-
</p>
<p id="p_11">                   "Let both the learned State counsel have categoric

                   instructions as to how the employees working on the

                   establishment of Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court are

                   not held entitled to weightage/benefit/reservation

                   being granted to the wards of the employees of the

                   States of the Punjab &amp; Haryana, failing which this

                   Court shall be constrained to restrain the State

                   Governments from granting such benefits to the

                   wards of their employees."
</p>
<p id="p_12">(4).               Having found that similar conditions prevailed in the UT

                   Chandigarh also, a further direction to the following

                   effect was issued on 31.10.2011:-

</p><p id="p_13">                           "The affidavit dated 12.10.2011 filed by the State

                   of Haryana categorically mentions that the State

                   Government has decided to grant equivalence to the

                   High Court employees "with the employees of the

                   Government of India posted in Chandigarh or

                   Haryana in connection with the affairs of the

                   Haryana Government for issuance of a Residence

                   Certificate......"
</p>
<p id="p_14">                           In view of the said revised decision, it is directed

                   that let the requisite 'Residence Certificate' be issued

                   to the petitioner.        The respondent-University is

                   further directed to consider her claim for admission

                   against the reserved seat as per the above mentioned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> CWP No.12090 of 2011.doc                                                -4-</span>




                   State Government decision before the next date of

                   hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                            In case, there is no other candidate higher in

                   merit in the category she belongs, the petitioner be

                   given admission to the Five Years Integrated Course

                   of B.A.LL.B. (Hons.).
</p>
<p id="p_16">                           The above stated revised decision of the State

                   Government, however, does not respond to the query

                   raised by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                           In the interest of justice, one more opportunity is

                   granted to both the State Governments/Chandigarh

                   Administration to take a conscious decision as to why

                   the employees working on the establishment of a

                   common High Court set up for both the States of

                   Punjab and Haryana, who apparently perform their

                   duties in relation to the affairs of the States of

                   Punjab, Haryana and Union Territory, Chandigarh,

                   are being no treated at par with the employees of the

                   States of Punjab, Haryana and Union Territory,

                   Chandigarh, as the case may be."
</p>
<p id="p_18">

(5).               The petitioner though pursuant to the above-stated

                   direction has been granted admission rendering this writ

                   petition infructuous, nevertheless it shall not absolve the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> CWP No.12090 of 2011.doc                                             -5-</span>




                   States of Punjab, Haryana or UT Chandigarh from taking

                   an appropriate Policy decision in accordance with law.

(6).               At this stage, learned counsel for the State of Punjab

                   submits that a policy decision has been taken and is

                   likely to be notified very soon.
</p>
<p id="p_19">(7).               The writ petition is accordingly disposed of with a

                   direction to the State of Haryana and UT Chandigarh to

                   take the policy decision in accordance with law and notify

                   the same.
</p>
<p id="p_20">(8).                The needful shall be done as early as possible but not

                   later than three months from the date of receipt of a

                   certified copy of this order.

<p id="p_21">(9).               Ordered accordingly. Dasti.
