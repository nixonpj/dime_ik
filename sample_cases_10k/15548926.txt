              Court for anticipatory bail.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                    Heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the parties.

              Perused the case dairy.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                    The petitioner is the husband and an engineer under the

              employment of I.T. Company. According to the learned counsel for

              the petitioner, he earns about Rs.70,000/- per month as his salary.

</p><p id="p_6">                    At the very outset the learned counsel appearing for the

              petitioner, Mr. Samir Kanti Mazumdar, submits that although he is

              not admitting any of the allegations made against the petitioner in

              the First Information Report but as a matter of good gesture and

              considering the moral duty of the husband/petitioner to maintain his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              2</span>


married wife and one child of three years, his clients is willing to

maintain his wife and one child and ready to pay Rs.15,000/- per

month. He also submitted that maintenance for this month will be

paid within fifteen days from this date and thereafter by seventh of

each succeeding month.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      In reply, the learned counsel appearing for the State submitted

that although she is not conceding the submission of Mr. Mazumdar

so far as the allegation is concerned but she is not standing on the

way if under this development the prayer for anticipatory bail is

allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties

and considering their respective submissions, we are of the opinion

that on the undertaking given by the learned counsel appearing for

the petitioner, the prayer for anticipatory bail of the petitioner may

be considered favourably. This application is allowed in terms of the

undertaking as aforesaid.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      Accordingly, it is directed that in the event of arrest, the

petitioner shall be released on bail to the satisfaction of the arresting

officer upon furnishing a Bond of Rs.5,000/- on condition that after

release, he shall surrender before the court concerned within four

weeks thereafter.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      This order is subject to the conditions laid down in sub-section

(2) of <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_12">Section 438</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              3</span>


</p><p id="p_11">      We, however, make it clear, the payment of maintenance to

wife and one child, as voluntarily offered by the husband/petitioner,

through his counsel, shall be in force, till any order of maintenance

is made by a competent court. We also make it clear, quantification

of amount of maintenance and entitlement of maintenance by the

wife and one child, if arises for a decision before a court of law in

terms of statutory provisions, such court must not be swayed by this

voluntary offer of maintenance by the husband and order must be

made in accordance with law. The husband shall be obliged to pay

maintenance to the wife and one child, as voluntarily offered by him,

so long no order in this regard is passed by a competent court.

</p><p id="p_12">      The application for anticipatory bail, is, thus, disposed of.
