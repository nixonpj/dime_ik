<pre id="pre_1">     IN THE COURT OF SHRI GAGANDEEP SINGH: ADDITIONAL SENIOR CIVIL 
       JUDGE :  JSCC : GUARDIAN JUDGE, KARKARDOOMA COURTS (EAST)



Suit No. 100/2014 

Shri Subhash Chander Chauhan 
s/o Late Shri Bishan Das
                                                             ............... Plaintiff. 
                                                 Versus

     1. The Delhi Development Authority
        Through its vice Chairman 
        Vikas Sadan, INA New Delhi. 
     2. Government of NCT of Delhi 
        through its 
        Department of Urban Development, 
        Delhi Sachivalaya, I.P. Estate, 
        New Delhi. 
                                                             .............. Defendants.  

O R D E R 
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.     Vide this order, I shall dispose off an application under order 39 rules 1 and 2 of 

the CPC filed by the plaintiff in the present suit. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.     The plaintiff has pleaded that he is the owner and in possession of property no. 

B­30   (old   No.B­6),     Block   B,   Khasra   no.   393/264/1,   New   Ashok   Nagar,   Delhi­96 

(hereinafter referred to as suit property), measuring about 252 sq. yards.  He purchased 

the said property from the erstwhile owner which was measuring 352 sq. yards in the 

year   1989.     But   during   the   year   1997,   around   100   sq.   yards   of   the   property   was 

demolished by the DDA for making sewage pipe line etc.  The plaintiff's property was 

constructed   prior   to   08.02.2007   as   per   aerial   survey   images     during   regularization 
 proceedings and is also protected under the Delhi Laws (Special provision) Act, 2011. 

But   on   12.02.2014   the   officials   of   defendant   no.1   reached   at   suit   property   with   the 

demolition squad without giving any prior notice or show cause etc.  They destroyed the 

household articles without any legal jurisdiction.  They further threatened that plaintiff 

will be dispossessed from the suit property. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.     Further, as per DDA notification dated 24.03.2008 concerned authorities found 

that   the   B   block,   New   Ashok   Nagar   which   is   unauthorized   colony   is   eligible   for 

regularization without any objection from the defendant no.1. A provisional certificate 

was also issued which includes the plaintiff's suit property.  Further, the said property is 

part of development area no. 181 which has now been notified and only MCD has the 

authority to take action over unauthorized construction.   Hence he has preferred the 

present suit for declaration, permanent injunction as well as damages.  The relief under 

Order 39 rule 1 and 2 CPC has been sought in the form of restraining the defendants 

from interference in the peaceful possession of plaintiff in the suit property till disposal 

of present suit. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.     The defendant no.1 in the written statement has claimed that the plaintiff has no 

locus   standi   and   he   has   unauthorizedly   encroached   upon   government   land.     The 

unauthorized structure raised upon the government land has already been demolished by 

them on 12.02.2014 consequent to the order passed by Hon'ble Delhi High Court in 

CWP no. 4919/2011 dated 17.09.2013 and subsequently upheld in LPA No. 630/2013.  It 

has been further claimed that the said land falling in khasra no. 393/264 min of village 

Chilla   Saroda   Bangar   was   acquired   by   government   vide   award   no.   39/82­83.     The 

physical possession was handed over to DDA by LAC on 01.10.1982.  But the plaintiff 
 has unauthorizedly encroached upon the government land and raised certain structure 

which   has   now   been   demolished   and   presently   the   land   is   in   possession   of   DDA. 

Further, it has been claimed that the land in dispute constitutes th right of way (ROW) on 

the proposed 45 meters wide Master Plan Road in New Ashok Nagar Colony, Delhi and 

hence it is out of the purview of regularization process. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.     The   defendant   no.2   has   claimed   that   the   RWA   of   plaintiff   colony   applied   for 

regularization   under   Regulation   dated   24.03.2008.     The   copy   of   LOP   and   list   of 

members   of   RWA   were   filed   by   them   and   the   plaintiff's   property   is   part   of   LOP 

submitted   by  RWA.    But   as  per  status report  of SDM  Mayur Vihar the property in 

question is a government land and hence plaintiff is not entitled to any relief. 

</p><p id="p_6">6.     It was argued on behalf of plaintiff that as per the regularization policy the order 

was passed on behalf of GNCT dated 04.09.2012.  A total of 895 unauthorized colonies 

were regularized and their boundaries were identified under Regulation of 2008.   The 

suit property falls in the colony regularized under the said order and the said fact has 

been confirmed by the written statement of defendant no.2.  It was also argued that the 

DDA   has   blatantly   violated   the   order   of   L.G.   as   reflected   in   annexure   'a'   dated 

11.09.2007.  Lastly it was argued that the order of Hon'ble Delhi High Court relied upon 

by defendant no.1 has since been reviewed vide order dated 17.01.2014 and hence he has 

been   given   liberty   to   approach   civil   court   for   protection   of   his   rights.     Thus   the 

observation of Hon'ble High Court in its order dated 17.09.2013 does not affect his case. 

</p><p id="p_7">7.     On the contrary it was argued on behalf of Ld. Counsel for DDA that the writ 

petition preferred by the plaintiff herein alongwith other petitioners have already been 

dismissed by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court and said order has already been upheld in 
 appeal vide order dated 17.09.2013.  Therefore, in consequent to the said order they have 

carried out the demolition action and since then they are in possession of entire suit 

property which owned by them.   Further, the plaintiff is not entitled for the benefit of 

regularization policy either in terms of the order dated 04.09.2012 as the land in dispute 

constitutes right of way on the proposed master plan road.  It was also argued that mere 

de­notification of development area does not infringe the right of true owner to protect 

its own land.  
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.     Similarly, the counsel for GNCT also opposed the case of plaintiff by stating that 

still the boundaries of New Ashok Nagar Delhi the unauthorized colony are still to be 

finalized.  The final certificate is still to be issued by them.  Therefore, plaintiff is not 

entitled to any relief. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.     Heard the parties and gone through the record. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.    The   claim   of   the   plaintiff   that   he   is   the   owner   and   in   possession   of   the   suit 

property measuring 252 sq. yards and he being protected under regularization policy has 

been discussed in detail by the Hon'ble High Court in CWP No. 4919/11.  The said claim 

was rejected vide order dated 23.07.2013.   All the grounds taken in the suit now were 

also under consideration before the Hon'ble High Court.   Para 19­20 of the order is 

reproduced hereunder for the sake of convenience:­  

         "....19.   The   order   dated   4th  September   2012   issued   in   pursuance   to 
         Regulations for Regularization of Unauthorized Colonies in Delh framed 
         under   Section   57   of   Delhi   Development   Act,   1957   would   not   be 
         applicable in view of its Regulation 3.3 which states that unauthorized 
         colonies which pose hindrance in the provision of infrastructure facilities 
         or fall in the area of right of way of existing or proposed master plan 
         roads amongst others cannot be considered for regularization. 
</p><p id="p_11">         20. Consequently, as the land in question is required for construction 
           of proposed Master Plan Road of forty­five meter wide which constitutes 
          a public project, neither Section 3 (2) of the Act, 2011 nor the Order 
          dated 4th September 2012 offers any protection to the petitioners."


</p><p id="p_12">11.    Therefore, the Hon'ble High Court has categorically held that the plaintiff herein 

is not entitled for the relief either under the Delhi Laws (Special provisions) Act 2011  or 

under order dated 4th September 2012 which is the basis of the present suit.  

</p><p id="p_13">12.    Though, it was argued that the said order has been reviewed and hence there is no 

categorical finding against the plaintiff with respect to the suit property.  The said order 

dated 17.01.2014 in review of petition no. 653/13 is perused. The reliance was placed 

upon para 3 of the said order but the said reliance is complete misinterpretation of the 

said order.  Para 3 only reproduced the contention of the review petitioner i.e. plaintiff 

herein who stated that the issue of right of way viz­a­viz boundaries of unauthorized 

colony cannot be adjudicated in writ proceedings and civil suit is the appropriate forum. 

But the para 4 is the decision of the Hon'ble High Court in Review Petition.  It rejected 

the averment of review on the ground that no such plea was urged either in the writ 

petition or in the  appeal.  Therefore, the review petition was dismissed.  Hence in these 

circumstances, original order dated 23.07.2013 which has been subsequently upheld in 

detail in LPA vide order dated 17.09.2013 stands as it is which goes entirely against the 

plaintiff.  
</p>
<p id="p_14">13.    The entire case of the plaintiff is based on the claim of  ownership on the ground 

that he purchased the suit property vide GPA dated 17.04.1989 from one Dr. K.D. Shom. 

Surprisingly, all the said documents have been got registered at Noida, UP. Though the 

properties falls in Delhi.  There is no averment in entire GPA as to how Dr. K.D. Shom 
 became owner of the property.   Thus, the said ownership documents are of doubtful 

nature.   Apart from that the plaintiff has placed reliance upon one property tax receipt 

which is of recent origin only i.e. of the year 2012­13 dated 27.06.2012.  The plaintiff has 

also placed reliance upon electricity connection installed at the suit property vide CA 

No. 101130715 but surprisingly the enerzisation also of recent origin i.e. 07.05.2007. 

Even though plaintiff claims that he purchased the suit property way back in the year 

1989.   
</p>
<p id="p_15">14.    On the contrary the documents of ownership produced by DDA shows that the 

said land was acquired vide award no. 39/82­83 and subsequently possession was also 

taken   vide   proceedings   dated   01.10.1982.    The   revenue  record  shows  ownership  still 

lying in the name of government. Hence claim of plaintiff that he is the owner of the 

property prima facie appears to be not sustainable in view of unrebutted documents of 

DDA.  
</p>
<p id="p_16">15.    The   last   argument   advanced   on   behalf   of   plaintiff   was   that   the   action   of 

demolition by DDA is malafide and at the instance of builders.  The area in question has 

already been de­notified on 03.06.2010 and jurisdiction to take action qua unauthorized 

construction falls within the domain of EDMC.  To support the said plea reliance was 

placed   upon   one   information   obtained   from   DDA   vide   letter   31.05.2013.     The   said 

information was also obtained through RTI.   Merely because the said area in question 

i.e.   New   Ashok   Nagar   having   been   transferred   consequent   to   the   de­notification   to 

EDMC does not help the case of plaintiff.   The ownership of the suit property still 

remains with   DDA as is  reflected in the documents and in that  capacity demolition 

action has been carried out.   The demolition action has   not been carried out on the 
 ground of unauthorized construction.  But the object was to protect their property from 

encroachment.  
</p>
<p id="p_17">16.    It was also argued that the proposed road for which the suit property is being 

taken by DDA, is not being done  as per the master plan MPD 20­21.  The roads have to 

be started from the extreme of the place.   In the present case DDA has failed to apply 

the said principle.   There is no document on record to substantiate the argument of 

plaintiff.  It cannot be deciphered from the site plan filed by the plaintiff as to whether 

the said road is being not planned as per principles  laid down in MPD 20­21.  Till date 

no   objection   has   been   moved   on   behalf   of   plaintiff   with   DDA   or   other   concerned 

agencies regarding non following of the MPD while proposing the construction of ROW 

at the suit property.  
</p>
<p id="p_18">17.    In view of abovesaid reasons, I am of the considered opinion that plaintiff has 

failed to make out prima facie  case in his favour.  The other two ingredients also does 

not   lies   in   favour   of   plaintiff.   Any injunction order against  DDA would hamper the 

infrastructure development of the said area in turn would be in prejudice to the rights of 

the residents of the locality.   The said order would also in a way go against the spirit 

behind   the   regularization   policy   as   is   reflected   in   order   dated   04.09.2012   which 

specifically states that no regularization should be done which cause any hindrance to 

the infrastructural facilities proposed under the master plan 20­21.   

</p><p id="p_19">18.    In   view   of   abovesaid   reasons,   the   application   u/o   39   rule   1   and   2   CPC   is 

dismissed.
