                            JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This is an appeal filed by the appellant under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section

374(3)</a> of Cr.P.C., seeking to set aside the Judgment and order

dated 20.12.2018 passed by the learned XXI Additional Chief

Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru, in CC.No.5059/2016.


</p><p id="p_2">      2. The appellant is the accused and the respondent is the

complainant before the trial Court, for the sake of convenience

parties are referred by their ranks before the trial Court.


</p><p id="p_3">      3. The brief facts of the case are as follows:-

      The case of the complainant is that the accused and

complainant are childhood friends and accused No.2 is the wife of

accused No.1. In the month of May 2013 the accused persons

have approached him stating that they were going to start

boarding and lodging business at Chapparadahalli Village,

Periyapatna Taluk and requested him to join his wife Smt. Geetha

in the said business and to lend a sum of Rs.3,00,000/-.

Considering their request the complainant paid a sum of

Rs.2,00,000/- on 23.05.2013, Rs.20,000/- on 03.01.2014 and

Rs.80,000/- on 1st week of October 2014, totally Rs.3,00,000/-

from the complainant, and after few months the accused persons
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   3              Crl.A.No.634/2019</span>




approached him and informed that license could not be obtained

in their names and told that they agreed to return the entire

amount of Rs.3,00,000/- to the complainant along with interest

within 7 months from April 2015 to October 2015. The

complainant approached and demanded the accused persons to

return the said amount at that time the accused have issued a

cheque bearing No.445981 dated 29.10.2015 for a sum of

Rs.3,00,000/- drawn on Canara Bank, Keralapura Branch.          On

06.11.2015 the complainant presented the said cheque for

encashment in Karnataka Apex Co-operative Bank Ltd., and on

07.11.2015 the same was returned with an endorsement 'Funds

Insufficient'.   Hence, the complainant having left with no other

option got issued the legal notice to the accused persons on

18.11.2015 through RPAD calling upon the accused to repay the

cheque amount within 15 days from the date of receipt of the

notice, and the same were duly served on the accused on

24.11.2015.      Inspite of receiving the said notice, the accused

failed to comply with the terms of the notice. It is further alleged

in the complaint that the accused with dishonest intention and to

cheat the complainant issued the cheque in question having

knowledge about insufficient funds in his account and thereby
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   4              Crl.A.No.634/2019</span>




committed an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_2">section 138</a> of Negotiable

Instrument Act. Hence, the complainant filed the complaint before

the trial court.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      4.     The trial court took cognizance of offence and ordered

for issuance of summons to accused. The accused appeared

through his counsel and defended the case. The trial court

recorded the plea of accusation. The accused pleaded not guilty

of the accusation leveled against him and claimed to be tried.

Hence, the case was posted for trial.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      5.     To substantiate his case, the complainant himself was

examined as PW1 and got marked the documents as Exs.P1 to

</p><p id="p_8">10. After completion of the evidence, the matter was posted for

cross-examination of PW1. Since the accused and his counsel

did not turn up to cross-examine PW1, the cross-examination of

PW1 was taken as nil, thereafter the case was posted for

statement of accused under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_3">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., on 12.11.2018,

on the said date the trial court dispensed the recording of

statement of accused under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C., and posted

the   case    for   judgment,   subsequently   after   hearing   the

complainant, the trial court passed the judgment of conviction,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   5               Crl.A.No.634/2019</span>




and imposed sentence of fine of Rs.3,05,000/- in default of

payment of fine, directed the accused to undergo simple

imprisonment for four months.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">     6.      Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence

of the trial court, the appellant/accused has filed the present

appeal challenging the impugned judgment on various grounds.


</p><p id="p_11">     7.      After registering the appeal, this court ordered for

issuance of notice to the complainant.            The complainant

appeared through his counsel.         The lower court records were

secured. After receipt of the LCR, the appeal was posted for

arguments.     I have heard the arguments of both the sides.


</p><p id="p_12">     8.      I have carefully gone through the lower court records,

the impugned judgment of conviction and the grounds urged in

the appeal memo.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     9.      The following points arise for my consideration:-

</p><p id="p_14">     1.      Whether the judgment of conviction and order
             of sentence dated 20.12.2018 passed by the
             XXI Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,
             Bengaluru, in CC.No.5059/2016 is erroneous?

</p><p id="p_15">     2.      Whether the appeal deserves to be allowed?
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  6                 Crl.A.No.634/2019</span>




</p><p id="p_16">    3.     What Order?
</p>
<p id="p_17">    10.    My findings on the above points are:-
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">           Point No.1       :-       In the Affirmative
           Point No.2       :-       In the Affirmative
           Point No.3       :        As per the final order
                                     for the following

                          REASONS

</pre><p id="p_18">    11.    Points No.1 and 2:- These points are taken together

for discussion for the sake of convenience and to avoid

repetition of facts.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
    I have gone through the entire records of the case. It is

noticed from the perusal of lower court records particularly the

order sheet that the statement of accused was not recorded by

the trial court as required under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_5">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C. The

case was posted on 25.10.2017 for cross-examination of PW1,

on the said date the accused was absent and cross-examination

of PW1 was taken as nil and thereafter case was posted for

statement of accused under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_6">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., and issued

NBW against the accused. That on 12.11.2018 accused was

absent on the said date the trial court has proceeded to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 7                Crl.A.No.634/2019</span>




dispensed with the recording of statement of accused under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_7">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C., since the accused remained absent.


</p><p id="p_20">    12.   From the order sheet of the trial court, it is noticed that

the trial court has dispensed with statement of accused under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_8">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C., and posted the matter for argument on

04.12.2018. On this day the trial court taken the arguments of

accused as nil and posted the matter for judgment.             After

hearing the advocate for complainant, the trial court passed the

judgment of conviction. I have heard both the sides and I have

carefully perused the materials available on record.         Now, I

proceed to answer points for consideration.


</p><p id="p_21">    13.   Before answering the points for consideration, I would

like to discuss Section 313 Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
    <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_9">Section 313</a> (1) (b) of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10">Cr.P.C</a>., obliges that, in every enquiry

or trial, for the purpose of enabling the accused personally to

explain any circumstances appearing in the evidence against

him, the court shall after the witness of the prosecution have

been examined and before he is called on for his defense,

question him generally on the case. But the proviso to Section
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  8               Crl.A.No.634/2019</span>




313(1) of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_11">Cr.P.C</a>., provides that in a case where personal

appearance of accused has already been dispensed with the

court may also dispensed with his examination under Clause (b)

(1) of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_12">Section 313</a>. There is a scope for dispensing with the

recording of statement of accused under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_13">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., if

the personal attendance of the accused was dispensed with

under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_14">Section 205</a> Cr.P.C., in summons case. However, in the

case on hand personal attendance of the accused was not been

dispensed by the trial court under Section 205 of Cr.P.C.


</p><p id="p_23">    14.     That, the trial court has cited the judgment of Hon'ble

Supreme Court in Indian Bank Association and others Vs. Union

of India and others. Now, I would like to discuss the guidelines

laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in above cited case;


</p><p id="p_24">    23.1.      The Metropolitan Magistrate/Judicial Magistrate

(MM/JM), on the day when the complaint under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_15">Section 138</a> of

the Act is presented, shall scrutinize the complaint and, if the

complaint is accompanied by the affidavit, and the affidavit and

the documents, if any, are found to be in order, take cognizance

and direct issuance of summons.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                9                Crl.A.No.634/2019</span><p id="p_25">




    23.2 The MM/JM should adopt a pragmatic and realistic

approach while issuing summons. Summons must be properly

addressed and sent by post as well as by e-mail address got

from the complainant.    The court, in appropriate cases, may

take the assistance of the police or the nearby court to serve

notice on the accused. For notice of appearance, a short date

be fixed. If the summons is received back unserved, immediate

follow-up action be taken.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
    23.3 The court may indicate in the summons that if the

accused makes an application for compounding of offences at

the first hearing of the case and, if such an application is made,

the court may pas appropriate orders at the earliest.


    23.4 The court      should direct the accused, when he

appears to furnish a bail bond, to ensure his appearance during

trial and ask him to take notice under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_16">Section 251</a> CrPC to

enable him to enter his plea of defence and fix the case for

defense evidence, unless an application is made by the

accused under <a href="/doc/109927775/" id="a_17">Section 145(2)</a> for recalling a witness for cross-

examination.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  10                Crl.A.No.634/2019</span><p id="p_27">




</p><p id="p_28">      23.5 The court concerned must ensure that examination-in-

 chief, cross-examination and re-examination of the complainant

 must be conducted within three months of assigning the case.

 The court has option of accepting affidavits of the witnesses

 instead of examining them in the court. The witnesses to the

 complaint and the accused must be available for cross-

 examination as and when there is direction to this effect by the

 court.
</p>
<p id="p_29">
</p><p id="p_30">      15.   That, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has categorically

held that, the case under <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_18">Negotiable Instrument Act</a> has to be

expedite and the concerned court must ensure that examination-

in-chief,   cross-examination     and     re-examination     of   the

complainant must be conducted within three months of assigning

the case. It is further stated that, the witnesses to the complaint

and the accused must be available for cross-examination as and

when there is direction to this effect by the court. And it is further

directed to follow the above mentioned procedure for speedy and

expeditious disposal of cases falling under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_19">Section 138</a> of the

Negotiable Instrument Act.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                    11              Crl.A.No.634/2019</span><p id="p_31">




</p><p id="p_32">        16.    In the light of above mentioned observation. Now, I

would like to discuss the scope of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_20">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C.,


        The scope of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_21">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C., is very wide. It is not

 a mere empty formality. The object of recording of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_22">Section 313</a>

 of Cr.P.C., is to put all incriminating evidence to the accused so

 as to provide him an identity to explain such incriminating

 circumstances appearing against him in the evidence of

 prosecution. Thus plain reading of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_23">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C clearly

 show that, the questioning under Section 313 Clause 1(a) is not

 mandatory whereas questioning under Clause 1(b) of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_24">Section

 313</a> of Cr.P.C. is mandatory.
</p>
<p id="p_33">
</p><p id="p_34">        17.    In the judgment cited supra, it is clearly mentioned

 that    the    examination-in-chief,   cross-examination   and   re-

 examination of the complainant must be conducted within three

 months of assigning the case, in my view the examination

 includes the examination of the witnesses on behalf of the

 accused. Which include the examination of accused under

 <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_25">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. That the examination of the accused must

 also to be done within stipulated period of three months from the

 date of assigning the cases, and there is no discussion about
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                 12               Crl.A.No.634/2019</span>




the dispensing with the examination of accused under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_26">Section

313</a> Cr.P.C. However, in the instant case the accused was not

present on the date when the case was posted for further cross-

examination <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_27">Cr.P.C</a>. provides provisions to secure the accused

as well as the witnesses before the court either for his

appearance     or   for   examination.   Under   the   facts   and

circumstances of the case, I am of the opinion that trial court
