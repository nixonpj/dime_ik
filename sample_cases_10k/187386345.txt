   THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                    MP-2072-2018
   (Kamlesh Wankhede vs Smt Neha Mathur (Wankhede))

Jabalpur, Dated : 24-04-2018
     Shri J.L.Soni, Advocate for the petitioner.
     Heard on the question of admission.
     This miscellaneous petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of
the Constitution of India has been filed by the
petitioner/applicant who happens to be the husband of
the respondent/non-applicant.</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Admittedly, the petitioner has filed an application
under <a href="/doc/322349/" id="a_2">Section 9</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 in the
Court of Principal Judge, Family Court, Bhopal. The
petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated 19.3.2018
passed by the Second Additional Principal Judge, Family
Court, Bhopal whereby the petitioner's application to
close the non-applicant's right to lead the evidence has
been dismissed.
</p><p id="p_2">     Counsel for the petitioner submits that the
proceedings are going on before the Family Court and on
21.8.2017 the Court has noted that the non-applicant has
closed her evidence and the matter was kept for final
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             2</span>

arguments on 31.8.2017. However, subsequently vide
order dated 16.2.2018 the learned Judge of the Family
Court has allowed the respondent/non-applicant to lead
further evidence holding that it does not appear that the
right of respondent/non-applicant to lead evidence has
been closed.
</p><p id="p_3">     Counsel for the petitioner has drawn the attention
of this Court to the aforesaid order dated 21.8.2017     to
submit that the order dated 16.2.2018 is apparently
passed on wrong assumptions and there is an error
apparent on the face of the record and as such the
petitioner's application to review the aforesaid order
16.2.2018 was liable to be allowed.
</p><p id="p_4">     I have gone through the petition as also the
documents on record.
</p><p id="p_5">     Along with the petition, a copy of the order passed
by this Court in W.P. No.14582/2017 dated 20.9.2012
has also been filed by the petitioner. The said        writ
petition was filed at the instance of non-applicant/wife
and while disposing of the      petition, this   Court has
observed as under :
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             3</span>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "Having heard learned counsel for the
    petitioner and perused the record, it is
    apparent that the application which was
    submitted by the petitioner to the Hospital
    authorities and their reply was not placed by
    her before the Family Court when the
    impugned order was passed and hence the
    Family Court had no occasion to consider the
    same which has led to passing of the
    impugned order which otherwise in the
    considered opinion of this Court, is just and
    proper, but looking to the fact that the
    aforesaid documents were not placed before
    the Family Court, the petition is disposed of
    with a direction to the petitioner to file an
    appropriate application afresh before the
    Family Court inviting attention of the
    aforesaid facts and the advice given by the
    hospital. If such an application is submitted
    by the petitioner, the same shall be decided
    on merits within a period of four weeks from
    the date of filing of such application."</blockquote>


<p id="p_6">     Thus a specific direction was given to the Family
Court to decide the petitioner's application afresh. In
such circumstances, even if the right of the non-applicant
was closed by the Family Court, her right to lead further
evidence was already saved by the order passed by this
Court.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                           4</span>

<p id="p_7">                                   In such circumstances, this Court does not find any
                             irregularity or jurisdictional error in the order passed by
                             the learned Family Court and as such the admission of
                             the petition is declined.
</p><p id="p_8">                                   Accordingly, the petition stands dismissed.
                                   C.c. as per rules.
</p><p id="p_9">                                                               (Subodh Abhyankar)
                                                                       Judge
