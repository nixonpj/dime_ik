 BEFORE THE MADURAI BENCH OF MADRAS HIGH COURT

DATED: 23/09/2010

CORAM
THE HONOURABLE Mr.JUSTICE K.CHANDRU

Writ Petition (MD)No.7348 of 2009
and
M.P (MD) Nos.1 &amp; 2 of 2009

Christinal Mary		...	Petitioner

Vs.

The Commissioner,
Kuzhilithurai Municipality,
Kuzhilithurai,
Marthandam Post,
Kanyakumari District.		...	Respondent

Prayer

Petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India praying
for the issuance of a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus, to call the records in
the impugned proceedings in Na.Ka.No.2103/2005/A2 dated 14.06.2006 on the file
of the respondent and to quash the same and directing the respondent to repay
the recovered amount form the petitioner in pursuant of the impugned order.
	
!For Petitioner	... Mr.S.Saji Bino
^For Respondent	... Ms.Kalainila

:ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">	The petitioner is working as Revenue Assistant in the respondent
Municipality.  She has come forward to challenge the order dated 14.06.2006, by
which the respondent fixed the liability on the petitioner to pay back the
amount, which are not collected from the various persons under the Head of
Professional tax.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. It is stated by the respondent that it is the responsibility of the
Revenue Assistant to collect the professional tax from the various employers and
if any amounts are not paid, they should issue reminder notice and take
appropriate disciplinary proceedings including Court action and since the
arrears of amount are not collected from the defaulters, the entire
responsibility should be fixed on the Revenue Assistant.  It is also stated
because of her shirking responsibility, the Municipality has faced with loss of
revenue.
</p><p id="p_3">	3. When the matter came up on 03.08.2009, this Court ordered notice to the
respondent. On notice, the respondent has entered appearance, but till date no
counter affidavit has been filed by them.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	4. The learned counsel for the petitioner stated that in case of any
arrears of tax, whether professional tax or house tax, the role of the Revenue
Assistant is very limited and if there is any deliberated omission to collect
the said amount,  disciplinary action can be taken.  But the entire liability
for collection of arrears cannot be fastened on the Revenue Assistant.  Strong
reliance was placed upon the judgment in V.Nagarajan Vs. Commissioner, Salem
Municipality, Salem reported in 1988 WLR 38.  In that case, this Court, after
referring to the previous decisions of the said subject, held that under the
municipal rules, the responsibility to collect the tax arrears from the
defaulters vested only with the Commissioner being the Chief Executive of the
Panchayat and it is for him to set the law in motion by filing appropriate
cases.  The arrears standing to the credit of such defaulters cannot be taken
from the salary of either the Bill Collector or the Revenue Assistant.  The said
decision was also came in M.Ramiah Vs. Commissioner, Tirunelveli Corporation,
Tirunelveli and another reported in 2008 INDLAW MAD 1362.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	5.In the light of the above, the impugned orders cannot have any legal
reason to stand and accordingly, the same stands set aside.  This Court while
passing order in M.Ramiah case in paragraph 13 has observed as follows:
	"13. In view of this fact, the impugned order will stand set aside and the
first respondent Corporation is directed to hold a proper enquiry and fix the
liability to the extent the petitioner was responsible for the loss.  While
doing so, the first respondent Corporation, against whom several Writ Petitions
have been filed earlier on similar issues, wherein this Court had held that for
the time barred tax dues or non-collection, responsibility cannot be fixed on
the collecting officials and there must be further materials to prove that they
were directly responsible for causing loss to the Corporation, shall take note
of the same.  After taking note of the circumstances, the first respondent
should pass appropriate orders, after giving opportunity to the petitioner and
fix the liability.  If the petitioner is even thereafter aggrieved, it is open
to him to work out his remedy in the manner known to law.  The first respondent
is hereby directed to undertake this exercise within a period of twelve weeks
from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.  The writ petition is disposed
of accordingly.  No costs.  The connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed."
</p><p id="p_6">	6.In the light same, if there is any negligence or any lacks on the part
of the Revenue Assistant, it is always open to respondent to take disciplinary
action and impose appropriate punishment.  But that does not mean the entire
arrears due from the defaulters fastened on the Revenue Assistant.  With these
observations, the writ petition stands allowed. Consequently, connected
miscellaneous petitions are closed.  However, there shall be no order as to
costs.
