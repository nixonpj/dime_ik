                                  Petitioner-Abhay son of Shamsher, has directed the instant

                     petition for the grant of regular bail in a case registered against him along

                     with his other co-accused, namely, Amit, Balram and nine other accused,

                     vide FIR No.425 dated 08.12.2012, for the commission of offences

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                      CRM No.M-11446 of 2013                                    2</span>

                     entire matter deeply, to my mind, the present petition for regular bail

                     deserves to be accepted in this context.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                     4.           According to the prosecution that on 07.12.2012, all the

                     twelve accused came at the spot and petitioner-Abhay, Krishan, Parveen

                     and Satish caught hold complainant-Vilas, whereas main accused-Amit

                     inflicted two knife blows on his left side of chest and waist. No other

                     specific role or overt-act is attributed to the petitioner.     Admittedly,

                     during the course of investigation, nine co-accused of the petitioner were

                     found innocent and were exonerated by the police and final police report

                     (challan) was submitted only against the petitioner, Amit and Balram, co-

                     accused.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                     5.           Moreover, the petitioner was arrested on 09.12.2012. Since

                     then he is in judicial custody and no useful purpose would be served in

                     further detaining him in jail. Since, even not a single witness has yet

                     been examined by the prosecution, so, the conclusion of trial will

                     naturally take a long time.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                     6.           In the light of aforesaid reasons, taking into consideration the

                     role assigned to the petitioner and totality of other facts and

                     circumstances, emanating from the record, as discussed here-in-above

                     and without commenting further anything on merits, lest it may prejudice

                     the case of either side during the course of trial, the instant petition for

                     regular bail is hereby accepted. The petitioner is ordered to be released on

                     regular bail on his furnishing adequate bail bonds and surety bonds to the

                     satisfaction of the trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                                  Needless to mention that, nothing observed here-in-above,
