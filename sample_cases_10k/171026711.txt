MANMOHAN SINGH, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.      The petitioner has filed the present revision petition under Section 115
of the CPC for quashing the order dated 12th April, 2013. Learned counsel
for the petitioner has made only one submission that the compromise deed
was not signed by all the parties particularly the same does not bear the
signature of Smt.Madhu Kiran Malhotra. However, learned counsel for the
petitioner does not dispute that the compromise deed was signed by his
client namely Kamal Mohan Soni.
</p><p id="p_2">2.      The trial court by order dated 10 th November, 2010 decreed the suit in
terms of the compromise. Smt.Poonam Arora on 6 th June, 2011 filed an
execution petition as decree holder against the present petitioner Kamal
Mohan Soni, Lalit Mohan Soni and Madhu Kiran Malhotra as judgment
debtors. The petitioner filed the objection on 4th May, 2012 inter alia taking




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">C.R.P. No.94/2013                                                 Page 1 of 3</span>
 the same plea that since the compromise is not signed by all the parties
therefore the execution petition is not maintainable.
</p><p id="p_3">3.      Learned executing court heard the matter on 7th December, 2012 and
rejected the objection to the execution petition No.336/2011 on 12 th April,
2013 with cost of `10000/-.
</p><p id="p_4">4.      The trial court in paras 13 to 14 has dealt with the objection raised by
the objectors including the present petitioner and gave its findings in paras
13 to 15 of the impugned order which read as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "13. Now coming to the next point of objection i.e. Smt. Madhu
        Kiran Malhotra being not a party to the settlement. On this
        aspect, there is statement of JD no.1 Sh. Kamal Mohan Soni
        that the JD no.3 (Smt. Madhu Kiran Malhotra) had already
        relinquished her share in favour of JD no.2. Having made the
        statement on oath in Court on 08.02.2012, JD no.1 who is the
        objector herein is estopped from taking a contrary stand in the
        objections. This statement was also accepted on behalf of JD
        no.2 by his counsel in his statement recorded on 08.02.2012.
        Therefore, estoppel operates against both these JDs, who cannot
        stake a contrary stand now. In the referred to suit, as per the
        arguments of JD no.1 he himself and the DH herein had
        challenged the relinquished deed executed by JD no.3 in favour
        of JD no.2. Apparently, now when the DH and JD no.1 and 2
        had settled the matter in the suit for partition, they have
        accepted the factum of relinquishment deed executed by the JD
        no.3 (Ms. Madhu Kiran Malhotra) in favour of the JD no.2.
        Ostensibly, the JD no.1 wants to come out of the settlement by
        pressing into service hypertechnical objections.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        14. The rule of estoppel is that a person cannot take a „U‟ turn
        from his earlier stand when other parties have changed their
        position on the basis of the said statement. Thus, the JD no.1
        cannot take a contrary stand.
</blockquote>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">C.R.P. No.94/2013                                                 Page 2 of 3</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">         15. The objection of JD no.1 that the compromise deed was not
        signed by all the parties for the reason that it does not bear the
        signatures of Smt. Madhu Kiran Malhotra carries no substance
        for the reason that through the JD no.2 namely Sh. Lalit Mohan
        Soni, the JD no.3 is duly represented as she had relinquished
        her share in favour of JD no.2 and this fact has been conceded
        to by all the parties. Though, Smt. Madhu Kiran Malhotra was
        a party in the original suit as defendant no.3 and had filed her
        written statement."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">5.      Learned counsel for the petitioner has not denied the fact that the
settlement was duly signed by his client.        He has also not argued that
Smt.Madhu Kiran Malhotra has not relinquished her share in favour of Lalit
Mohan Soni/judgment debtor No.2 who is the signatory to the settlement.
</p><p id="p_6">6.      Thus, it appears to the Court that the present petition is totally false
and frivolous. The same is accordingly dismissed.
