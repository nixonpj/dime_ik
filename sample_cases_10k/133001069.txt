P.C:-

1                 Heard learned counsel for the appellant and learned
counsel for the respondent - Corporation.


2                 This Appeal challenges an order dated 2.2.2019
passed by the Judge, City Civil Court, Mumbai refusing the
prayer of the appellant for directing the Corporation to grant
necessary No Objection Certificate in favour of the appellant
and also to allow the appellant to carry on the business of

Warehousing/RMC plant on the said plot. The trial Court was
of the opinion that during the pendency of the suit the
mandatory injunction as prayed for cannot be granted.


3                 Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that
though they have applied to the Corporation from time to time
for permission under Section 390, the same is not considered
nor any decision taken.             Learned counsel for the appellant
would submit that they are willing to comply with the
requisitions in accordance with provisions of law.                  Learned
counsel for the Corporation invited my attention to the order
pointing out the compliances which are necessary to be made
by the appellant for getting factory permit.


4                 Learned counsel for the appellant would invite my
attention to the judgment and decree of the Civil Court dated
25.8.2011 and which is in favour of the appellant. As per this
judgment and decree, the trial Court has held that the
Corporation has unlawfully terminated the lease in respect of
the suit property. It is further held that the appellants have not
committed breach of the terms and conditions of the lease.
Even notice of the Corporation calling upon the appellant to
hand over possession of the suit plot is declared to be illegal.


5                 In this view of the matter, learned counsel for the
appellant would submit that there is no justification for the

building proposal department in refusing to issue no objection
certificate to the appellant.            It is his submission that the
building Proposal Department is refusing to grant no objection
certificate only because the First Appeal filed by the
Corporation against the judgment and decree dated 25.8.2011
in Long Cause Suit No.884 of 2009 is pending in this Court. He
would submit that judgment and decree of the trial Court is in
force and though Appeal is filed the same has not been stayed.


6                 In this view of the matter, in my opinion the
following order will meet the ends of justice :


                                   ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1         The appellant to make a fresh application for appropriate
factory permit and for the no objection certificate by 22.7.2019
to the Assistant Commissioner, 'M', East Ward, to the Deonar
Abattoir as well as building proposal department.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2         It is made clear that mere pendency of the First Appeal
against judgment and decree dated 25.8.2011 will not be a
ground to refuse the no objection certificate.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3         If any further compliance is necessary then the competent
authority concerned will call upon the appellant to comply with
the same within a period of one week from 22.7.2019.</p><pre id="pre_2">
