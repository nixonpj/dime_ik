                                               COMMON ORDER



                          The Writ Petitioner challenges three orders of assessment passed

                 under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act, 2006 (in

                 short 'Act') for the periods 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12.



                          2.Though various grounds have been raised assailing the impugned

                 orders, before me, the only ground urged is the violation of principles of

                 natural justice, contending that an opportunity of personal hearing was

                 not extended to the petitioner prior to conclusion of proceedings.



                          3.This is a matter where there had been an inspection conducted by

                 the Enforcement authorities. The orders of assessment are based

                 substantially on the basis of the proposals of the Enforcement Wing.



                          4.A pre-assessment notice was issued, in response to which, the

                 petitioner had filed a letter dated 10.10.2013 requesting time upto

                 October, 2013 for filing objections. Again by letters, dated 01.11.2013 and

                 21.11.2013 (no acknowledgment is available on file for the latter) fifteen

                 days initially and another fifteen days thereafter was sought to file

                 objections. Admittedly, no objections have been filed till the date of

http://www.judis.nic.in
                                                        3

                 conclusion of assessment. Thus, the Assessing Authority has proceeded

                 on the basis that the petitioner has nothing to say. However, admittedly,

                 no opportunity of personal hearing has been granted to the petitioner

                 prior to completion of the proceedings.



                          5.This Court, in a slew of decisions and the Principal Commissioner

                 and Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, vide Circulars have reiterated on

                 several occasions, the importance, nay, mandate for a personal hearing,

                 prior to completion of assessment proceedings.



                          6.In the present case, though the petitioner has not filed any

                 objections, it has sought some time to do so. The attitude of the assessee

                 thus cannot be said to be totally non-co-operative. Moreover, admittedly,

                 the authority concerned has neglected to call upon the assessee for a

                 personal hearing prior to completion of the assessment.



                          7.In the aforesaid circumstances, these Writ Petitions are allowed

                 and the impugned orders set aside. The petitioner will appear before the

                 Assessing Authority on 31.07.2019 at 10.30 a.m. No separate notice will

                 be issued and this order constitutes sufficient notice. After hearing the

                 petitioner and considering all materials that may be circulated by it,

                 orders of assessment shall be passed de novo by the Assessing Officer

                                                      4

                 within a period of four weeks from date of conclusion of personal hearing.

                 It is made clear that if the assessee does not appear before the Assessing

                 Officer, de novo orders may be passed by the Assessing Authority in

                 consideration of the materials available on record. No costs.




                                                                      15.07.2019
