               THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                         M.P. No.3195/2019
               (<a href="/doc/114833876/" id="a_1">Padam Chand Jain &amp; ors. vs. Mahaveer Prasad Jain</a>)

Gwalior, Dated : 27.08.2019

      Shri Abhishek Bindal, counsel for the petitioners.

      Shri Anand Bhardwaj, counsel for the respondent No.1.</pre>

<p id="p_1">      The present petition has been filed challenging the order dated

17.05.2019 passed in Civil Suit No.1A/2013 whereby the application

filed under Order 6 Rule 17 of CPC for amendment in the plaint owing

to a subsequent development and change in the circumstances have

been rejected by the learned trial Court without considering the aspect

that the same is contrary to law and owing to the subsequent

development and changes the application should have been allowed.

</p><p id="p_2">      It is alleged by the counsel for the petitioners that a civil suit for

declaration and permanent injunction was filed before the trial Court

on the count that the plaintiffs and defendants are members of joint

Hindu family and family was governed under the Mitakshara Hindu

Law KE Banaras School. It is submitted by the counsel for the

petitioners that the civil suit was filed wherein the learned trial Court

vide its judgment and decree dated 24.12.2004 has dismissed the suit

of plaintiffs. An appeal was preferred against the judgment and decree

dated 24.12.2004 which was registered as First Appeal No.36-A/05

and the lower appellate Court vide its judgment and decree dated

5.3.2005 has set aside the judgment and decree passed by the learned

trial Court and the suit was decreed in favour of the petitioners. A

second appeal was preferred which was registered as Second Appeal

No.451/2005 and the second appeal was finally heard and decided by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>
              THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                        M.P. No.3195/2019
              (<a href="/doc/114833876/" id="a_2">Padam Chand Jain &amp; ors. vs. Mahaveer Prasad Jain</a>)

the Hon'ble High Court on 8.9.10 and the judgment and decree passed

by the learned first appellate Court was set aside and the matter was

remanded back to the appellate court for hearing on merits. The first

appellate court after rehearing of the first appeal has passed the

judgment and decree dated 12.12.2012 and has remanded the matter

back to the trial Court for the reason that sisters being a daughter of

late Shri Badri Prasad are necessary and proper party to the present

case as Anguri Devi was not impleaded as a party therefore the matter

was remanded for impleading Anguri Devi and sisters as a party with a

direction to permit them to lead evidence and thereafter decided the

civil suit on merits. In pursuance to the aforesaid remand order the

civil suit is still pending before the trial Court. An application under

Order 1 Rule 10 was filed before the trial court which was allowed by

the trial court on 7.12.2018 and thereafter the written statement was

filed by the newly added parties and the matter was fixed for hearing

on 28.01.19. The newly added parties have filed the written statement

and a counter claim on 23.03.2019. Thereafter, an application under

Order 6 Rule 17 was filed for amendment in the plaint in view of the

changed circumstances as the newly added defendants have filed the

counter claim against the plaintiff. It was alleged that the amendment

is required in the plaint in the changed circumstances as certain

documents filed by the newly added defendants are required to be

countered. The learned trial Court after due consideration of the

application and hearing the arguments has rejected the same for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        3</span>
               THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                         M.P. No.3195/2019
               (<a href="/doc/114833876/" id="a_3">Padam Chand Jain &amp; ors. vs. Mahaveer Prasad Jain</a>)

reasons that the plaintiff was having the knowledge of the facts which

are proposed to be amended from the very beginning but he has not

chosen to incorporate the aforesaid in the plaint memo. It was further

observed by the trial Court that in response to the counter claim filed

by the defendants, the plaintiff has mentioned all these facts in their

response. Therefore, once the aforesaid facts are already placed before

the Court in reply to the counter claim filed by the defendants there is

no requirement of repetition of the aforesaid by way of amendment in

the plaint. Accordingly, finding the amendment not useful in the plaint

the learned trial Court has rejected the application vide its order dated

17.05.2019. Counsel for the petitioners has submitted that the

aforesaid order is per se illegal and contrary to the settled position of

law. He has relied upon the judgment passed in the cases of Vijay

Hathising Shah and Another Vs. Gitaben Parshottamdas Mukhi

and Others, reported in 2019 (5) SCC 360 and <a href="/doc/54322927/" id="a_4">Gurbakhsh Singh

vs. Buta Singh and another</a>, reported in 2019 (1) MPLJ 269 and has

prayed for setting aside of the impugned order and allowed the

application filed by the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      Per contra the counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents

has contended that the order impugned is rightly being been passed

and does not call for any interference under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_5">Article 227</a> of the

Constitution of India. He has further contended that the learned trial

Court has observed that the verbatim of the proposed amendment and

that of the reply to the counter claim are exactly identical, therefore,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                       4</span>
                 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                           M.P. No.3195/2019
                 (<a href="/doc/114833876/" id="a_6">Padam Chand Jain &amp; ors. vs. Mahaveer Prasad Jain</a>)

the learned trial Court has rightly observed that the same will amount

to the repetition of the facts which have already been brought before

this Court. The learned trial Court has observed that the proceedings of

both the matters will run simultaneously. Therefore, once the aforesaid

facts have already been brought on record by way of reply to counter

claim there is no requirement of amendment in the plaint. It is further

contended that the aforesaid facts were very well in the knowledge of

the plaintiff from the very beginning but he has chosen not to

incorporate the same in the plaint memo. Thus, the same will not create

any difference in the evidence. Accordingly, the learned trial Court was

justified in rejecting the application. He has prayed for dismissal of the

writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.

      It is an admitted position that in the earlier round of litigation

the suit was decreed and the matter has travelled upto the Hon'ble

High Court. The Hon'ble High Court in Second Appeal No.451/2005

has allowed the appeal and has remanded the matter back to the first

appellate Court for rehearing on merits vide its judgment dated 8.9.10.

After the remand of the case to the first appellate Court the first

appellate Court has also remanded the matter back to the trial court

vide its judgment dated 12.12.2012. The learned first appellate Court

has remanded the matter with a direction to the trial Court for

impleadment of necessary parties to the civil suit. On the basis of the

remand order an application under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC was filed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                           5</span>
                THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                          M.P. No.3195/2019
                (<a href="/doc/114833876/" id="a_7">Padam Chand Jain &amp; ors. vs. Mahaveer Prasad Jain</a>)

which was allowed and Anguri Devi and sisters were impleaded as

parties to the suit being necessary parties, thereafter they have filed

their separate written statement alongwith the counter claim. The reply

to the counter claim was filed by the petitioners along with an

application under Order Rule 6 Rule 17 for praying amendment in the

plaint owing to the subsequent development. The application was

rejected by the trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      The provision of Section 6 Rule 17 are required to be seen.

       "Amendment of pleadings-The Court may at any stage of the
       proceedings allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings in
       such manner and on such terms as may be just, and all such
       amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose
       of determining the real questions in controversy between the
       parties.
</p><p id="p_6">       Provided that no application for amendment shall be allowed
       after the trial has commenced, unless the court comes to the
       conclusion that in spite of due diligence, the party could not
       have raised the matter before the commencement of trial."

      The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/89510185/" id="a_8">Abdul Rehman and

Another vs. Mohd. Ruldu and Ors</a>, reported in 2012 (11) SCC 341

has held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "11. The original provision was deleted by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_9">Amendment Act</a> 46 of 1999,
     however, it has again been restored by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_10">Amendment Act</a> 22 of 2002 but
     with an added proviso to prevent application for amendment being
     allowed after the trial has commenced, unless the court comes to the
     conclusion that in spite of due diligence, the party could not have raised
     the matter before the commencement of trial. The above proviso, to
     some extent, curtails absolute discretion to allow amendment at any
     stage. At present, if application is filed after commencement of trial, it
     has to be shown that in spite of due diligence, it could not have been
     sought earlier. The object of the rule is that courts should try the merits
     of the case that come before them and should, consequently, allow all
     amendments that may be necessary for determining the real question in
     controversy between the parties provided it does not cause injustice or
     prejudice to the other side. This Court, in a series of decisions has held
     that the power to allow the amendment is wide and can be exercised at
     any stage of the proceeding in the interest of justice. The main purpose
     of allowing the amendment is to minimise the litigation and the plea
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                         6</span>
                THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                          M.P. No.3195/2019
                (<a href="/doc/114833876/" id="a_11">Padam Chand Jain &amp; ors. vs. Mahaveer Prasad Jain</a>)

     that the relief sought by way of amendment was barred by time is to be
     considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of each case."</blockquote><p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">       In the case of Gurbakhsh Singh (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme

Court considering the case of Abdul Rehman (supra) has held as

under:-
</p>
<p id="p_9">         "The High Court was of the view that Proviso to Order 6 Rule 17
  of the CPC, as duly amended, laid down that once the trial had
  commenced, no amendment could be allowed unless the Court were to
  come to the conclusion that the party could not have raised the matter
  before the commencement of the trial despite due diligence.
</p><p id="p_10">         "6. In the present case the record of Civil Suit No.195 of 1968 in
  which ex parte decree was passed on 30.06.1969 is not traceable. In the
  circumstances, there could possibly be some inability in obtaining
  correct particulars well in time on part of the appellants. At the time
  when the application for amendment was preferred, only two official
  witnesses were examined. The nature of amendment as proposed neither
  changes the character and nature of the suit nor does it introduce any
  fresh ground. The High Court itself was conscious that the amendment
  would not change the nature of the suit. In the given circumstances, in
  our view, the amendment ought to have been allowed. In any case it
  could not have caused any prejudice to the defendants.

      From the perusal of the aforesaid law laid down by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court and the provision of 6 Rule 17, the amendment on the

basis of the subsequent development was a material amendment and

the application filed for the same should have been allowed by the

learned trial Court. In the present case as the new parties were added as

defendants and they have filed their written statements and counter

claim. The learned trial Court has permitted the counter claim but has

refused the application for amendment in plaint. Once the counter

claim was permitted then there was no occasion for the trial Court for

refusing the amendment application, as evidence will be required to be

lead by the parties on the basis of the pleadings. If there will be no

                      THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                                M.P. No.3195/2019
                      (<a href="/doc/114833876/" id="a_12">Padam Chand Jain &amp; ors. vs. Mahaveer Prasad Jain</a>)

      pleadings it will be objected by the defendants at the time of evidence.

      By the aforesaid amendment no prejudice will be caused to the

      defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_11">            Considering the aforesaid preposition of law laid down by the

      Hon'ble Supreme Court and the fact that owing to the subsequent

      development and impleadment of necessary parties who have

      subsequently filed their separate written statement the plaintiff was

      justified in filing an application under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC for

      proposing amendment in the plaint memo. Accordingly, the order

      passed by the learned trial Court is set aside. The application filed

      under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC by the plaintiff is hereby allowed and he is

      directed to incorporate the aforesaid amendment in the memo of plaint.

</p><p id="p_12">            Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed. No order as to cost.
