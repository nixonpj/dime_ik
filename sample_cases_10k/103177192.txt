</pre><p id="p_1">j) Brief reasons for the just decision of the case:Â­


       In brief the case of the prosecution against the accused Afzal is that

on 23.7.09 at unknown time before 7.45 pm on main 66   foota road near

Pyaoon in front of wall of nala  accused  had pasted a poster depicting his

picture regarding welcoming of  'Kanwariyas'  and had defaced the public

property and had committed  an offence punishable under section 3, DPDP

Act. Accused  was arrested  in this  case by ASI Satyabir Singh   and was

released  on   bail  from  the  police  station  itself  being  involved  in  bailable

offence.  However it was revealed after filing of the chargesheet that he was

in custody in some other case, hence he had refused to obtain regular court

bail and thus remained in custody, throughout the trial. 



</p><p id="p_2">2.     After completion of investigation, charge sheet was filed against the

accused.  Cognizance of the offence was taken against the accused  by this

court  and charge for an offence punishable under section 3 DPDP Act was

framed   against   the   accused   on   24.12.2009   to   which   he   had  pleaded   not

guilty and claimed trial.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">FIR  no. 280/09                                                         Page 2of pages 8
</p><p id="p_5"> 3. To   prove   its   case   against   the   accused,  prosecution   has  examined  four

     witnesses in all.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.       PW1 was HC Madan Mohan who had deposed that on 23.7.09 he was

posted at PS Seelampur( wrongly typed as Shahdara) as HC and working as

duty officer from 4 pm to 12 night. He had proved the carbon copy of the

FIR  Ex. PW1/A and his endorsement on the rukka Ex. PW1/B. 

</p><p id="p_7">5.       Witness   was   not   cross   examined   by   the   accused   despite   giving

opportunity to him in this regard. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">6.       PW2 was Ct. Irfan Ahmed who had deposed that on 23.7.09 he along

with ASI Satbir and HC Salekh Chand was on patrolling duty in the area of

beat no.1 and at around 7 pm  when they had  reached at 66 feet road, they

had seen a poster at the wall of nala near pyaoon (water dispenser). The

words 'Jai Bhim Jai Bharat' were written on the same and there was a photo

of Goddess 'Shivji Parvati' on the same and also a photo of accused Hazi

Afzal   and   other   leaders   of   BSP     which   were     printed   on   the   same.

Photographs  of the said  posters were taken which were   mark A and B.

Thereafter ASI Satbir Singh had  prepared rukka and had  handed over the

same   to   him   for   registration   of   FIR.   He   went   to   PS   and   got   the   case

registered and had  returned back to the  spot after registration of FIR and


FIR  no. 280/09                                                              Page 3of pages 8
 had  handed over original rukka and copy of FIR to ASI Satbir Singh. The

said poster was Ex.PW 2/A which was seized by IO vide memo Ex.PW 2/B.

Rough site plan was prepared and on   21.10.09 they went to the house of

accused at K227, New Seelampur and had arrested him vide arrest memo

and   personal   search   memo   Ex.PW   2/C   and   D   .   He   had   identified   the

accused in the court. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.     During cross examination by the accused witness had deposed that he

had never seen anybody while affixing the posters on the wall and had also

not seen the accused on the spot. IO had never interrogated anybody in his

presence,  from any printing press about the person who got printed the said

poster. He also could not tell as to who had  pasted the posters on the wall.

He  had  denied  the  suggestion  that  he was deposing  falsely  and no  such

poster was ever found on any wall and they had  prepared a false case.



</p><p id="p_11">8.     PW3 HC Salek Chand had deposed the similar facts as deposed by

PW2 and during his cross   examination he had deposed that he had never

seen  anybody while affixing the posters on the wall.  He had admitted it to

be   correct     that   he   had   never   seen   accused   on   the   spot.   IO   had   never

interrogated anybody  in his presence,   from any printing press about the

person who got printed the said poster.  He also could not tell as to who had

pasted the posters on the wall and had denied the suggestion that he was


FIR  no. 280/09                                                              Page 4of pages 8
 deposing falsely and no such poster was ever found on any wall and  they

had prepared a false case.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">9.    PW4 was ASI Satbir Singh IO of the case who had also deposed the

similar facts as deposed by PW2 and PW3. He had prepared the rukka Ex.

PW4/A and had also prepared the rough site plan Ex. PW4/B. He had also

identified the accused. 
</p>
<p id="p_14">10.   Witness   was   cross   examined   by   the   Ld.   defence   counsel   Shri   S.

Mansoorie and during cross examination, he had deposed that  there was no

writing on the wall by ink or chock.   He had never seen anybody while

affixing the posters on the wall. He had admitted it to be correct that he had

never seen   accused on the spot. He had no knowledge whether there was

any enmity between DCP Gogia, ACP Gurcharan Das and father of accused

and also had no knowledge   if said DCP Gogia and ACP Gurcharan Das

were accused in any criminal case filed by father of accused. Further he

could not recall if elections proceedings were completed by that day or not.

There was no poster of any other person on the road. He had denied the

suggestion that a false case was made by them at the instance of person who

had won the election. 
</p>
<p id="p_15">11.   Thereafter PE was closed. 
</p>
<p id="p_16">12.   Statement of the accused was recorded under <a href="/doc/224316/" id="a_1">section 281</a> Cr.P.C and


FIR  no. 280/09                                                       Page 5of pages 8
 the entire incriminating evidence appearing on record against him was put

to him to which he had denied and had stated that he was falsely implicated

in this case due to rivalry between his father and some Senior police officer.

He had led evidence in his defence. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">13.    DW1 was Inspector Ved Singh Malik who had deposed that he was

posted   as   SHO   Seelampur,   North   East   w.e.f.27.6.08   to   20.04.2010     and

during his tenure as an SHO Seelampur the Assembly Elections(MLA) were

held.     There   were   about   5/6   candidates   in   fray.   BSP   Candidate   had

displayed posters in the area of Seelampur and at adjoining area of New

Usmanpur.  He had heard that  the father of accused Mohd. Iqbal  had made

several complaints against  concerned police officials. Without verification

of records, he could not tell as to whether the maximum no. of cases for

defacement of public property were registered against the accused alone or

not.  His further examination  was deferred for want  of   some summoned

record. 
</p>
<p id="p_18">14.    DW2   HC   Harswaroop   had   brought   the   record   regarding   cases

registered under section 3 DPDP Act during election in the year 2009 and

the copy of FIRs were enclosed and were placed on record as  Ex. DW2/A

to  Ex. DW2/H. 
</p>
<p id="p_19">15.    Witness was not cross examined by the Ld. APP for the State despite

giving opportunity to him. 
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">FIR  no. 280/09                                                       Page 6of pages 8
</p><p id="p_22"> 16.    After appreciation of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses as

well as perusal of the documents placed and proved on record by them, I

have no hesitation in holding that prosecution has not been able to bring

home the guilt of accused beyond any reasonable doubt as for  the  reasons

best known to it, neither any eye witness has been examined nor even the

witness from the printing press from where the said poster was published

had been produced  in the court. Further it has been held by the Hon'ble

High Court of Delhi in  T.S. Marwah &amp; Ors. Vs. State 2008(4) JCC 2561

that  in   such  cases  of  posters  since    no  ink or chowk is used,  hence  the

provision  of  <a href="/doc/1944156/" id="a_2">Section  3</a>  West    Bengal  Act shall  not  get  attracted. Further

there   is   no   eye   witness   produced   by   the   prosecution   who   had   seen   the

accused either getting the said posters printed from the printing press or had

seen   him   getting   them   affixed   at   public   places/premises,   hence   the

possibility of commission of a mischief by the political rivals of the accused

cannot be ruled out. 
</p>
<p id="p_23">

</p><p id="p_24"> 17.   It is a cardinal principle of law that prosecution must prove the guilt

of the accused beyond reasonable doubt   and all the benefits arising from

the lacunaes of the prosecution story must be given to the accused. Hence in

my opinion, prosecution has failed to bring such material on record which

would have gone to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable


FIR  no. 280/09                                                           Page 7of pages 8
 doubt holding him guilty for the offence  alleged to have been committed by

him   resulting   into   his   conviction   and   sentence.   Accused   is,   therefore,

acquitted for the offence .  His BB/SB stands cancelled and discharged.  File

be consigned to record room after completion of necessary formalities.
