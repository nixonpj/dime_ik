Tyagi, Adv. for the applicants have addressed  their arguments  on the

given my  considered thoughts to the arguments addressed by the ld.

counsels for the parties. My findings on various contentions, as raised

by the counsel for the applicants are as under:

C O N T E N T I O N   N O: 1


</p><p id="p_10">                1) that the suit for recovery under the provisions of Order

</p>
<p id="p_11">5                      Perusal  of the record  shows that the plaintiff deposited a

sum of   Rs. 4,83,000/­   with defendant No.1   on 26.12.2003   and a

Cash   Certificate   bearing   No.001862   was   issued     by   defendant

No.1/JD No.1 in favour of the plaintiff and the date of maturity was

26.6.2004 . The plaintiff received the part payment  of Rs. 83,000/­ on

21.5.2004 but the remaining payment  of Rs. 4,00,000/­  has not been

made by the JDs to the plaintiff till date.  
</p>
<p id="p_12">6                      Perusal of the cash certificate dated 26.12.2003  indicates

that  the said certificate was to mature  on 26.6.2004  and, therefore,

the period  of limitation  for filing the present  suit  starts    only with

effect from 27.6.2004 .  
</p>
<p id="p_13">7               Perusal of the  calendar, issued by the Hon'ble High Court ,

for the year 2007,   shows that the subordinate courts in Delhi  had

remained closed  for summer vacations with effect from 3.6.2007  to

30.6.2007   and it was a Saturday on 1.7.2007. The present suit  has

been instituted  on 2.7.2007  and, therefore, as per the provisions of

<a href="/doc/1393166/" id="a_2">Section 4</a>   of the Limitation Act, 1963   the period of limitation get

extended till 2.7.2007 and, therefore, the present suit is well within

the period of limitation.  This contention of the applicant is, therefore,

rejected.

8                      It has been admitted  by the ld. counsel for the defendant

No.3/JD   No.3     that   the   defendant   No.3     was   the   director     of   the

</pre><p id="p_16">defendant No.1. But, he has also argued  that the  defendant No.3  has

not done  any act on behalf of  defendant No.1 and has never issued

any document or receipt or cheque in favour of the plaintiff.

9                      On the other hand, the ld. counsel for the D.H has argued

that the JD No.3/applicant/defendant No.3  is responsible for the  acts

of defendant No.1  and the other directors of defendant No.1,  in the

capacity     of   a   director     of     defendant   No.1.   Since     the   defendant

No.3/JD No.3,  is admittedly a director of JD No.1, I find no merit in

her  contention that JD No.3  is not liable  to pay the suit  amount to

the   plaintiff   and,   therefore,   this   contention   of   the   applicant   is

rejected.

10                It has been argued by the counsel for the applicant/JD

</pre><p id="p_20">No.6 that JD No.6   is the husband   of JD No.3 and he was never a

director of JD  No.1  and was having  no relation with JD No.1  at any

time. It is  admitted by the ld. counsel for the DH that JD No.6 was

never a director  of JD No.1, but, it is argued  that JD No.6  was the

person,   who   persuaded   the   plaintiff   to   make   the   deposits   with   JD

No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_21">11                     From     the  material  on  record   it  is  clear  that  the  Cash

Certificate  No.001862  dated 26.12.2003  has been issued on behalf

of JD No.1 and the  same bears the signature of the director and the

treasurer of  JD No.1.  In view of the settled legal position  about the

liability   of   the   directors   of   a   company,   it   can   be   safely   held   that

defendant No.6  is not responsible  or liable for making any payment

of the plaintiff regarding the  cash certificate dated 26.l2.2003.  Only

the directors of the company and the company itself  are responsible

to make the payment to the plaintiff in respect of the cash certificate

dated 26.12.2003. Furthermore,there is no other document, on record,

except the cash certificate  dated 26.12.2003, to establish the liability

of   JD   No.6.   The   registration   of   a   case   FIR   under   Section

406/409/420/120­B  <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">I.P.C</a>. by itself is not sufficient to fasten  the civil

liability     on   JD   No.6.     Furthermore,   the   counsel   for   the   DH   had

served a legal demand notice  dated 19.4.2007  only upon JDs No.1 to

4, who are the company and its  directors respectively, but, still  she

preferred   to   institute   the   suit     against   the   JD   No.6   also.   In   these

circumstances, this contention  of the ld. Counsel for the applicant/JD

No.6  is up held.
