     The   onus   to   prove   this   issue   was   upon   the   defendants.   No

evidence has been led by the defendants on this issue. Accordingly,

</p><p id="p_35">20.   It is argued on behalf of the plaintiff that the defendants have

   been trying to illegally connect their sewer line to the drainage pipe

   and a complaint in this regard was made to concerned department

   of PWD. It is submitted that PWD had lodged a complaint to the

   police against the defendants copy of which is EX.PW1/A.

   lines are in existence for past 15 years and nothing new has been

   installed by them as alleged. The defendants further argued that

   the  sewer  pipes   have  been  broken   by  the machine  of  Govt.   No

   evidence has been led by the plaintiff in support of his contention

   before the filing of the suit defendants made several attempts to

   repair   the   broken   passage   on   their   land   but   each   attempt   was

   thwarted   by   the   plaintiff   by   lodging   a   false   police   complaint.   No

   injured in the disputed broken area and as such the broken portion

   is not as dangerous as is alleged by the plaintiff. Plaintiff has failed
