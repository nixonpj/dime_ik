                         the order dated 26th June 2008 passed by the

                         learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Nawada by

                         which     the    cognizance            has    been      taken    in

                         petitioner,      he     gave      his    fard      beyan   to   the

                         13.5.2007 at 8.15 P. M. alleging that on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                    2</span>




same day at 7.15 a.m. while he was ploughing

his field, cattle graziers               raised alarm that

Kailu Yadav was shot by the accused- Bhushan

Chauhan. Thereafter, the informant went to the

place of occurrence and saw that his brother,

Kailu   Yadav     was     lying    dead      and       blood    was

oozing from his person. Son of the informant,

Bali    Yadav    and     his   nephew        Pandit      Jee    and

several    persons        told     the       informant         that

Bhushan Chauhan shot the deceased dead. The

reason for the occurrence is the contract of

constructing road. Bhushan Chauhan had taken

soil from the wheat field of the informant for

which on 12.5.2007 Kailu Yadav had altercation

with Bhushan Yadav, who had threatened him to

kill.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            3.          The    contention          of     learned

counsel for the petitioner is that fard beyan

of the informant was not correctly mentioned

by the police officer and he filed a protest

petition    dated       17.5.2007       in      the     Court    of

learned    Chief        Judicial    Magistrate           stating

therein    that    on    the     date    and     time     of    the

occurrence the deceased was returning after

getting    grinded       the     gram     and     in     the    way

accused    Bhushan      Chauhan     and      Azad      Yadav    had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                         3</span>




made    altercation               with    the    deceased.         During

that altercation, Azad Yadav instigated co-

accused Bhushan Chauhan to kill the deceased

and, thereafter, Bhushan Chauhan shot fire at

Kailu Yadav causing his death. Informant as

well as other cattle graziers Bali Yadav son

of Ramdeo Yadav and Pandit Jee, son of Lakhan

Yadav saw giving shot to the deceased and both

of     them       running         away        from    the     place     of

occurrence.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                  4.        It is further contended that

again       the    petitioner            filed       another      protest

petition          dated      14th    September          2007      in    the

Court       of    learned         Chief       Judicial       Magistrate

that    Kailu          Yadav       was     murdered         by    accused

Bhushan Chauhan and Azad Yadav, opposite party

no.    2.     Again         the    petitioner         has     filed     the

protest petition dated 26.10.2007.

</p><p id="p_7">                  5.    After investigation, the police

submitted         charge-sheet            against       the      accused,

Bhushan       Chauhan         for    the       offence       punishable

under Section 302 I.P. C. and 27 of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_2">Arms Act</a>

and    the       complicity         of     the       co-accused        Azad

Yadav        was        not        found.        Thereafter,           the

cognizance          has      been        taken       against      accused

Bhushan          Chauhan      only       by    the     learned      Chief
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                     4</span>




Judicial Magistrate vide impugned order dated

26.6.2008

</p><p id="p_8">              6.     The main contention of learned

counsel for the petitioner is that the protest

petition and the other materials were before

the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate and he

ought to have taken cognizance against accused

Azad    Yadav,      opposite   party     no.    2.    He   has

further contended that after receipt of the

charge-sheet,        learned     Magistrate     has       three

options. He may agree with the final report

and accept it and close the proceeding or he

may    give    direction    to    the   police       to    make

further       investigation       or     he     may        take

cognizance of the offence if in its opinion

the facts set out in the final form constitute

an offence notwithstanding contrary conclusion

of    the   Investigating      Officer.    It     cannot     be

said that the Magistrate cannot disagree with

the report while exercising its power under

<a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_3">Section       190</a>   Cr.P.C..      In    support      of     his

contention, he has relied upon decisions of

this Court in the case of Ashok Yadav &amp; Anr.

Vs. State of Bihar, reported in 2006(1) PLJR

204 and in the case of Nathun Yadav &amp; Anr. Vs.

State of Bihar, reported in 2001(4) PLJR 754.

</p><pre id="pre_3">               7.           On     the     other       hand,        the

contention       of       learned    counsel         for     opposite

</pre><p id="p_9">party is that opposite party no. 2 was not

named in the FIR and the petitions filed by

the    informant-petitioner               do     not    amount       to

protest     petition         as     it     appears         from     the

petitions       filed       by     the    informant.         He     has

further submitted that there is no material on

record to show the complicity of the opposite

party no. 2 in the alleged offence, as such

the      learned          Magistrate           has     not        taken

cognizance against him.
</p>
<p id="p_10">               8.         After hearing learned counsel

for both the parties and on perusal of the

material on record it appears that FIR was

lodged    against          the    accused       Bhushan      Chauhan

only     for        the     occurrence          took       place     on

13.5.2007. When the informant-petitioner                           came

to know that the name of co-accused has not

been mentioned in the fard beyan, he filed a

protest petition in the Court of learned Chief

Judicial       Magistrate           at     the       earliest       on

17.5.2007.       Again       he    filed       petition       in    the

Court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate on

14.9.2007        and       again     on     26.10.2007.            From

reading     of       all     these       three       petitions      it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                     6</span>




appears     that    protest       was    made     against       the

police      and    allegations          were    made     against

opposite party no. 2. After investigation the

police has submitted charge-sheet against co-

accused Bhushan Chauhan and the complicity of

accused Azad Yadav has not been found. It was

open to the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate

to   take    recourse      to    three      options.     He     may

agree with the final report and accept it and

close the proceeding or he may give direction

to the police to make further investigation or

he may take cognizance of the offence if in

its opinion the facts set out in the final

form     constitute       an     offence       notwithstanding

contrary      conclusion         of     the     Investigation

Officer. It cannot be said that the Magistrate

cannot      disagree       with       the       report        while

exercising        its    power    under     <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_4">Section      190</a>     of

Cr.P.C. as it has been held in the decision

reported     in    2006(1)       PLJR    204     (supra).       The

petitioner has no grievance against the order

taking cognizance against co-accused Bhushan

Chauhan. He has only grievance that learned

Magistrate        should       have     differed       with     the

finding      of    the     Investigating         Officer       and

should have taken cognizance against opposite
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   7</span>




                 party no. 2 against whom there is material to

                 show his complicity in the alleged offence.

</p><p id="p_11">                            9.        Considering   the   facts   and

                 circumstances stated above, learned Magistrate

                 is directed to consider the material available

                 on record for considering the facts whether

                 there is material against accused, opposite

                 party no. 2. The Hon'ble Supreme court in the

                 case of <a href="/doc/1309482/" id="a_5">Raghubans Dubey vs. State of Bihar</a>,

                 reported in AIR 1967 page 1167 has held that

                 once the Magistrate takes cognizance, it is

                 his duty to find out who the offenders really

                 are and once he comes to the conclusion that

                 apart from the persons sent up by the police

                 there are material against the other accused

                 persons for issuance of summons, he can summon

                 the accused. The summoning of the additional

                 accused is part of the proceeding initiated by

                 his taking cognizance of offence.

</p><p id="p_12">                            10.   With the aforesaid observation

                 and   direction,       this   application    stands

                 disposed of.
