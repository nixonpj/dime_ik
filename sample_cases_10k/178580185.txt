(BY SRI B.M. ANGADI, ADVOCATE)

AND

THE SPECIAL LAND
ACQUISITION OFFICER,
UPPER KRISHNA PROJECT, BILAGI.
                                          -       RESPONDENT
(BY SMT. MEGHA C. KOLEKAR, H.C.G.P.)

       This appeal is filed under <a href="/doc/165686982/" id="a_1">Section 54(1)</a> OF Land
Acquisition Act against the judgment and award dated
16.12.2009 passed in LAC No.234/2005 on the file of the
Civil Judge (Sr. Dn.), Bilagi, partly allowing the reference
petition for compensation and seeking enhancement of
compensation.

     Misc. Cvl. No. 108993/2010 is filed praying to
condone the delay of 188 days in filing the appeal.

      This appeal along with Misc. Cvl. No.
108993/2010 coming on for hearing on interlocutory
application this day, the Court delivered the following:
                             :4:




                        JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.      I.A. No.2/2011 has been filed to recall the order

dated 06.03.2012. By the said order three weeks' time

was granted to comply with the office objections, with a

condition that in case of non-compliance, the appeal

shall stand dismissed without reference to the Court.

Seeking recalling, I.A. No.2/2011 has been filed. There

being delay of 156 days in filing I.A. No.2/2011, I.A.

No.1/2011 has been filed. Since the delay is inordinate,

while     the   appellant   is    entitled   to   enhanced

compensation, the appellant is denied the interest on

the enhanced compensation amount, for the delay

period of 156 days in filing I.A. No.2/2011.       I.A. No.

1/2011 is allowed accordingly. Being satisfied with the

cause shown I.A. No.2/2011 is allowed and appeal

restored.

</p><p id="p_3">2.    Smt. Megha C. Kolekar, learned High Court

Government Pleader, is directed to accept notice and

appear for the respondent.

<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.    With the consent of learned counsel on both the

sides, the matter is taken up for final disposal.


</p><p id="p_6">4.    There is a delay of 188 days in filing this appeal.

Seeking condonation of delay, Misc. Cvl. No. 108993/

2010 has been filed. Since the delay is inordinate, but

the appeal has merit, for the delay period, interest is

denied    to   the   appellants    and   Misc.      Cvl.   No.

108993/2010 is accordingly allowed.


</p><p id="p_7">5.    Heard the counsel on both sides and perused the

record.

<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">6.    Appellants are the owners of the open sites

bearing VPC No.62/B, 169/B, 460/A, 460/1B, 562,

1313, 1316 and 1317 situated at Galgali village, Taluk

<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_2">Acquisition Act</a>, on 29.08.1996, the said properties were

acquired and an award was passed on 15.03.1999

proposing to pay compensation at the rate of Rs.5/- per

sq.mt.      The land owners having protested and a

reference    having   made    to   the     Civil   Court   for

determination of the market value of the acquired land,

by a judgment and award dated 16.12.2009, the

reference was allowed in part and the market value was

fixed at 50% over and above the compensation awarded

by   the    respondent.      Feeling     aggrieved,   seeking

enhancement, this appeal has been filed by the land

owners.

<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">7.   Sri B.M. Angadi, learned counsel appearing for the

appellants submitted that the matter is covered by an

award dated 17.10.2003 passed in M.F.A. No.262/2002

and connected cases.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">8.   Learned Government Pleader upon perusal of the

the judgment and award passed by this Court dated

17.10.2003 in M.F.A. No.262/2002 and connected

cases.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">9.    The lands which were the subject matter of

consideration   in   M.F.A.    No.262/2002   decided   on

17.12.2003, was acquired under a notification dated

02.11.1996 issued u/S 4(1) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_3">Land Acquisition Act</a>.

The said properties were acquired for the very same

project.   The Land Acquisition Officer had offered

compensation of Rs.5/- per sq.mt. The Reference Court

award being not acceptable, was questioned by the

landowners.     In the said appeal, this Court has

determined the market value of the properties at

Rs.120/- per sq.mt.    That apart, the land losers were

held entitled to all statutory benefits in accordance with

law with, a raider that the appellants will be entitled to

interest, only from the date of award.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 :8:</span>




</p><p id="p_16">10.   Since the matter is squarely covered by the said

judgment and award, following the same and for the

very same reasons, this appeal is allowed and the

market   value    of    the    properties   acquired   by   the

respondent is determined at Rs.120/- per sq.mt.             The

appellants are also entitled to all statutory benefits in

accordance with law.          Interest shall be payable only

from the date of award passed by the respondent.

However, the appellants are not entitled to interest for

the delay period, on the enhanced compensation

amount, in terms of the order passed on I.A. No.1/2011

and   Misc.    Cvl.    No.    108993/2010.      Draw    award

accordingly.
