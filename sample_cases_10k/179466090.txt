S.K. Katriar, J.         The petitioner seeks a direction to the respondent

          authorities for payment of interest on the cheque amount.

</p><p id="p_13">          2.             A brief statement of facts essential for the disposal of

          this writ petition may be indicated. The petitioner is a manufacturer

          and supplier of hume pipes. He had made supply of hume pipes to

          the State of Bihar through respondent no.4, in March 1992, in

          pursuance of the supply order dated 25.3.1992. Cheque dated

          31.3.1992, for Rs.81,008/-, was issued to him and was received by

          him on that date itself, being the last date of the financial year.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                           2</span>




According to the petitioner, he made attempts to have the same

encashed by presenting it before the concerned treasury but could

not be encashed because of heavy rush of cheque-holders which the

treasury was unable to handle. Consequently the cheque could not be

encashed which the petitioner returned to respondent no.4 on

2.4.1992. After persistent efforts for a period of little less than 11

months, respondent no.4 issued cheque dated 23.2.1993 for the like

amount which has been encashed. The present writ petition has been

preferred for payment of interest for a period of 10 months and 22

days along with costs.
</p>
<p id="p_14">3.             Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that he,

being a businessman, arranges his finances from the bank and other

sources for which he has to pay interest. Unless the petitioner is paid

for supply of the goods in time, he would suffer losses and the entire

profit earned by the supply would be eaten away by the interest he

has to pay to his lender. He submits that there was no justification

for the authorities to issue cheques on the last date of the financial

year on which date the treasuries of the Government of Bihar are

proverbially overburdened. He has relied on the following orders of

one of us (S.K. Katriar, J.), sitting singly:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       (i)   Order dated 1.3.2000, passed in C.W.J.C. No. 4927

             of 1999 (Ramdeo Singh Vs. The State of Bihar and

             others), since reported in 2000 (2) P.L.J.R. 235.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                         3</span>




</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      (ii)   Order dated 28.3.2000, in C.W.J.C. No.5704 of

             1999 (M/s. Bharat Agriculture and Mechanical

             Engineering Co. Vs. State of Bihar and others),

             2000(3) P.L.J.R. 126.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">4.            The learned Additional Advocate General has opposed

the writ petition. He submits that altogether nine cheques were

issued by respondent no.4 on that date and all the cheques, except

that of the petitioner, were encashed on the same day. In his

submission, therefore, non-encashment of cheque on 31.3.1992 may

be presumed to be attributable to the negligence of the petitioner. He

has also advanced submissions to distinguish the aforesaid reported

decision of the learned Single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_16">5.            We have perused the materials on record and

considered the submissions of learned counsel for the parties.

Learned counsel for the petitioner is right in his submission that the

Government treasury is proverbially over-crowded on the last date of

the financial year, and it is common knowledge that the cheque-

holders find it extremely difficult to have the cheques encashed on

that date. The respondent authorities have not explained the

justification for issuance of the cheque to the petitioner on the last

date of the financial year. We have no manner of doubt that no fault

can be attributed to the petitioner for non-encashment of the cheques

on 31.3.1992. We also find no justification for such enormous delay
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                          4</span>




in issuance of the fresh cheque. It is equally common knowledge that

businessmen arrange their liquidity from various sources including

the bank on payment of interest. If interest is not granted to the

petitioner on belated payment, then his profit would be eaten away

by payment of interest to the bankers. We are, therefore, convinced

that the petitioner should be compensated with payment of interest.

</p><p id="p_17">6.             The next question arises is that at the rate at which the

interest has to be allowed to the petitioner. Learned counsel for the

petitioner rightly relied on the order of this Court in Ramdeo Singh

Vs. The State of Bihar (supra). We are mindful of the position that

the same was rendered by a learned Single Judge, and one of us.

That was also a similar case for issuance of a fresh cheque by the

State Government to a civil Contractor in a situation where the

cheque could not be encashed within the same financial year because

of the fault attributable to the treasury officer. The writ petition was,

therefore, allowed with interest at the rate of 25%, and cost

quantified at Rs.25,000/-. However, there is one significant

difference with the present case, namely, cheque in that case was not

issued till the order of the Court. Therefore, that writ petition had

been preferred for a direction for payment of the principal amount as

well as interest. On the other hand, in the present case, fresh cheque

had already been issued to the petitioner, and this writ petition has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     5</span>




          been preferred only for interest and costs. We are, therefore, not

          inclined to grant interest at the same rate.
</p>
<p id="p_18">          6.1)           In the present case, unlike the reported decision, the

          fresh cheque was issued after a delay of precisely 10 months and 22

          days. We are, therefore, of the view that it does not appear to us that

          the present case is one of governmental arbitrariness. Nonetheless

          the petitioner has suffered because of being deprived of his money

          for quite some time. We are, therefore, of the view that interest of

          justice would be served if the petitioner is paid simple interest at the

          rate of 18%, from 31.3.1992 to 23.2.1993.
</p>
<p id="p_19">          7.             In the result, this writ petition is allowed. Respondent

          no.4 is hereby directed to ensure payment of interest in the aforesaid

          manner within a period of four months from today, failing which the

          petitioner shall be entitled to compound interest at the same rate for

          the same period. In the circumstances of the case, there shall be no

          order as to costs.
