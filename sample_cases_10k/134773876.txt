For Respondent(s)       :   Mr V.S.Rajpurohit-PP



            HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIJAY BISHNOI

                        Judgment / Order

08/08/2018

           This criminal misc. petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">section 482</a> CrPC is

preferred by the petitioner being aggrieved with the order dated

09.07.2018 passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Sanchore, District

Jalore (for short 'the trial court'), whereby it has rejected the

application filed by the petitioner for directing police authorities to

conduct further investigation into the allegations levelled in the

FIR No.34/2014 lodged at Police Station, Jhab, District Jalore,

wherein the police have filed negative Final Report No.86/2018,

which is pending consideration before the trial court.

</p><p id="p_4">           Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner filed a

complaint in the Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate,

Sanchore on 10.01.2014 while contending that he is Up-Sarpanch

of Gram Panchayat, Deora, whereas Pukhraj Jain is the Sarpanch

of that Gram Panchayat.
</p><pre id="pre_1">                                         (2 of 3)                   [CRLMP-2364/2018]



             It    is     mentioned     in    the      complaint     that     certain

</pre><p id="p_5">development works were carried out by the Gram Panchayat in the

months of October and November 2011 and thereafter in January,

2012, however, Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat - Pukh Raj Jain

made forged entries in the muster-rolls regarding labourers.

</p><p id="p_6">             It is alleged that Pukhraj Jain prepared forged muster-

roll and on the basis of forged entries in it, he received the

amount of wages of the labourers and misappropriated the same.

It is also alleged by the petitioner in the complaint that he made

several complaints against Pukhraj Jain to the authorities but no

action was taken by them and therefore, he is filing this

complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             The said complaint filed by the petitioner before the

Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sanchore was forwarded to

the police for investigation under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_2">section 156(3)</a> CrPC, the Police

Station,   Jhab         registered   FIR     No.34/2014      for     the     offences

punishable under <a href="/doc/1326844/" id="a_3">sections 409</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_4">420</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_5">467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_6">468</a> and <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_7">471</a> IPC against

Pukhraj Jain.
</p>
<p id="p_8">             The        police   have   now    filed    negative     Final    Report

No.86/2018 before the trial court and at this stage, the petitioner

moved an application for directing the police authorities to conduct

further investigation, which came to be rejected by the trial court

while observing that the petitioner has failed to convince it as to

on what point, he wants further investigation by the police. The

trial court was also of the opinion that the fact of rejection of the

anticipatory bail of the accused and the allegation of connivance of

S.H.O., Police Station, Jhab with Pukhraj Jain are not the ground

on which the matter can be sent for further investigation. The trial
                                                                     (3 of 3)                [CRLMP-2364/2018]



                                   court has observed that the petitioner is free to move a protest

                                   petition against the final report filed by the police.

</p><p id="p_9">                                               Being aggrieved with the aforesaid, the petitioner has

                                   preferred this petition.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                                               Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that as a

                                   matter of fact, the investigation has been conducted by as many

                                   as four Officers and they all have concluded that prima facie case

                                   for commission of cognizable offence against accused Pukhraj Jain

                                   is made out, however, the S.H.O., Police Station, Jhab in

                                   connivance with Pukhraj Jain has submitted the negative final

                                   report in the matter without taking into consideration the evidence

                                   available on record.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                                               Learned counsel for the petitioner has, therefore,

                                   prayed that the impugned order passed by the trial court be set

                                   aside and the police authorities may be directed to conduct further

                                   investigation into the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                                               Having heard learned counsel for the petitioner and

                                   having gone through the material available on record, I do not find

                                   any case for interference as the trial court after going through the

                                   material available on record has observed that the petitioner has

                                   failed to convince it as to on what points, the further investigation

                                   is necessary. The trial court has rightly observed that if the

                                   petitioner is aggrieved by conclusion arrived at by the police in the

                                   final report, he is free to move a protest petition.

</p><p id="p_13">                                               Hence, no case for interference is made out in this

                                   criminal misc. petition and the same is, therefore, dismissed.



</p><p id="p_14">                                                                                      (VIJAY BISHNOI),J
