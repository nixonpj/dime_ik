<p id="p_1">                     ORDERS

    This revision petition is filed u/s 397 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>.
against the order passed by X ACMM, Mayo Hall unit,
Bangalore in C.C.No.22758/2012 (Crime No.279/2011)
dated      14-08-2012     taking    cognizance        against
petitioners No.1 and 2 on the basis of the charge sheet
filed by the police, based on the FIR registered
pursuant to the complaint dated 22-08-2011 lodged by
the respondent No.2, for the offences punishable u/s
420 r/w 34 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2. The case of the petitioners is that-
        The complainant/respondent No.2 Vanitha being
the resident of M.V.Garden, Ulsoor, Bengaluru along
with her husband Ramu, an electrician by profession,
came in contact with one Prabhavathi, through her
uncle Suresh.        Said Prabhavathi approached the
complainant for loan, promising that she would return
the same soon after the sale of her landed property.
She had availed a total amount of one lakh rupees, on
different dates stretching from December 2010 to
January 2011. Thereafter in the month February 2011,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            3             Crl.R.P.No.25145/2015</span>


Prabhavathi, her husband Ezerkumar, brothers Manoj
Kumar and Gadam Mohan Kumar, father Lakshmaiah,
mother Krishnamma, sister Nanditha along with her
husband Harishankar also approached her for further
amount, she had paid Rs.50,000/- by obtaining the
same from her husband's friend Anandanna.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       3. The petitioners failed to return the amount
inspite of repeated requests and instead issued two
blank cheques. When presented for encashment, the
cheques were dishonoured. Alleging that the cheques
were        issued   with      an   intention     to    cheat    the
complainant,         she    filed   a   complaint      against   the
petitioners. Though the petitioners are innocent of the
charges leveled against them, the respondent No.1
police with a malafide intention registered a false case
against them and the trial court took cognizance
against the petitioners, for the offence punishable
under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_3">section 420</a> read with 34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>. Hence this
revision petition is filed along with application under
<a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_5">section 5</a> of Limitation Act to condone the delay in
filing the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       4.     In the revision petition the petitioners have
urged the following grounds-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                    4           Crl.R.P.No.25145/2015</span>


<p id="p_5"> I. The Respondent police gravely erred in
    registering the case against them, which is
    manifestly erroneous and opposed to the
    facts and circumstances of the case.
 II. In the complaint only the names of the
    accused No.1 and 2 are mentioned and no
    allegations        are   made    against      the
    petitioners.
</p><p id="p_6">III. There is no involvement of the petitioners in
    the business of accused No.1 and 2.
</p><p id="p_7">IV. No prima facie case is made out against the
    petitioners, but however only to harass the
    relatives of accused No.1, they have been
    falsely implicated.
</p><p id="p_8"> V. None of the ingredients of <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_6">section 420</a> IPC
    or under <a href="/doc/1306824/" id="a_7">section 415</a> of IPC, are established
    against the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_9">VI. The petitioners are only the relatives of
    accused No.1 and 2, and they were not
    involved in any business affairs of accused
    No.1and 2, but the respondent No.1 police
    have falsely implicated them.
</p><p id="p_10">VII. Respondent No.2 complainant was alleged
    to have been cheated by accused No.1 and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                         5                 Crl.R.P.No.25145/2015</span>


          the petitioners are not responsible for the
          same.
</p><p id="p_11">  VIII. The respondent No.1 has not produced any
          document pertaining to the involvement of
          the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     5.       Learned P.P for Respondents No.1 filed
objections,       wherein     it     is   mainly      stated      that
Complainant was cheated by Prabhavathi by making
her believe that if she invested the money in the Alpha
Vaccum Engineering company run by Prabhavathi and
her family, she could earn the benefits on such
investment and thereby availed Rs.1,50,000/- from the
complainant for her business, and thereafter issued
blank cheques to the complainant which were returned
unpaid, and therefore the complainant lodged the
complaint with the respondent No.1 police. After
investigation the police filed charge sheet against the
accused      persons    and        10th   A.C.M.M      Court      took
cognizance and issued summons to the accused.
Sufficient material has been collected by the I.O during
investigation, in respect of the alleged offence and
though the offences have been committed in the year
2010 itself, the accused remained absent and now filed
this revision petition without any valid grounds.

<p id="p_13">Contending thus, the learned P.P for Respondent No.1
has prayed for the dismissal of the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_14">       6. Inspite of service of notice the respondent No.2
remained absent.
</p>
<p id="p_15">       7. Heard the arguments of the learned counsel for
the petitioners and the learned P.P.
</p>
<p id="p_16">       8. The points which arise for my consideration
are:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           1.   Whether the petitioners are
                entitled for condonation of delay
                in filing the petition?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           2.   Whether the order passed by the
                trial court in taking cognizance
                against accused persons is
                proper?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">           3.   Whether the order of the trial
                court needs to be interfered by
                this court?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">           4.   What order?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       9. My finding on the above points are:
</blockquote><pre id="pre_2">           Point No.1:     In the Affirmative,
           Point No.2:     In the Affirmative
           Point No.3:     In the Negative
           Point No.4:    As per the final order for
                           the following :
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                      7           Crl.R.P.No.25145/2015</span>


                         REASONS

     10. Point No.1:-    The    petitioners    have      filed
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_6">application under <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_8">Section 5</a> of Limitation Act to
condone the delay of 927 days in filing the revision
petition. Respondent No.1 has not filed any objection.
</blockquote><p id="p_17">The reasons assigned for condoning the in ordinate
delay, of 927 days is not at all convincing.
</p>
<p id="p_18">     11. However, keeping in mind the settled position
of law that lenient view needs to be taken in the matter
of condoning of delay, to ensure that substantive
justice is done in any case, I am of the considered
view, that an opportunity needs to be given to the
Revision petitioners by condoning the delay, as prayed.
Hence, I answer point No.1 in the Affirmative.
</p>
<p id="p_19">     12. Point No.2 and 3: These Petitioners who are
the accused No.3 and 6 before the trial court,
categorically contended that the averments made in the
complaint prima-facie reveal that the petitioners were
in no way involved in the business affairs of accused
No.1 and 2.
</p>

<p id="p_20">     13. On perusal of the records, it is seen that a
complaint was filed before the jurisdictional Indira
Nagar P.S, Bengaluru/the respondent No.1              by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                         8              Crl.R.P.No.25145/2015</span>


complainant/respondent No.2 Vanitha, a resident of
M.V.Garden, Ulsoor, Bengaluru, that the accused No.1
Prabhavathi approached her for loan promising to
repay the same soon the sale of her landed property.
She had availed one lakh rupees on different dates,
stretching from December 2010 to January 2011.
Thereafter     in   the      month     of    February          2011,
Prabhavathi, her husband Ezerkumar, brothers Manoj
Kumar and Gadam Mohan Kumar, father Lakshmaiah,
mother Krishnamma, sister Nanditha along with her
husband Harishankar also approached her for further
amount, and she had paid Rs.50,000/- by obtaining
the same from her husband's friend                  Anandanna.
Thereafter they failed to return the amount inspite of
repeated requests by the complainant, and instead
issued   two    blank       cheques.   When      presented       for
encashment, the cheques were dishonoured, and
hence it is alleged against them that they have cheated
the complainant.        After investigation the respondent
No.1 police registered case against the petitioners, only
with a malafide intention, and the trial court took
cognizance against the petitioners for the offence under
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_9">section 420</a> read with 34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a>.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                          9             Crl.R.P.No.25145/2015</span>


<p id="p_21">     14. It is needless to mention that the scope of the
offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_11">section 138</a> of N.I Act and the offence
under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_12">Section 420</a> IPC are entirely different, and
merely because the cheques are involved, it cannot be
said that there cannot be any criminal case against the
accused for the offence under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_13">section 420</a> IPC. Though
there is a remedy in respect of dishonoured cheque
under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_14">section 138</a> N.I Act, the intention of the accused
to cheat the complainant, is to be established by the
complainant, only during the trial, in a Criminal case
for the offence under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_15">section 420</a> IPC.              Though the
complaint disclose only the name of Accused No.1, the
investigation conducted by the police revealed that
entire family of Accused No.1 Prabhavathi including
the petitioners/brothers of Accused No.1 are involved
in the alleged fraud played on the complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_22">     15. It is also seen that in the complaint the
intention of the petitioners to cheat the complainant is
specifically   alleged       and   Investigating    Officer    has
conducted detailed investigation in the matter about
the involvement of these petitioners also, and filed the
charge sheet. In the circumstances therefore, at this
stage the order passed by the trial court taking
cognizance of the above offence against the petitioners
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                        10           Crl.R.P.No.25145/2015</span>


cannot be found fault with. Hence, I find no merits in
this revision petition.       In view of these reasons
therefore, I answer Point No.2 in the Affirmative
and Point No.3 in the Negative.
</p>
<p id="p_23">     16. Point No.4:-       In the result, I proceed to pass
the following:
