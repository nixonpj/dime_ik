        Petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, to issue
a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus, calling for the records in respect of the
order passed by the 3rd respondent in Na.Ka.No.6123/A3/2013 dated 5.5.2014  
and quash the same and consequently direct the 3rd respondent to disburse

!For Petitioner : Mr.S.Chellapandian for Mr.T.Palanisamy
^For R1 to R3           :       Mr.Aayiram K.Selvakumar,  
                                Government Advocate  
For R4          : No appearance 


:ORDER  
</pre><p id="p_1">        Aggrieved by the impugned order dated 05.05.2014 passed by the District
Educational Officer, Tirunelveli, 3rd respondent herein, the petitioner has
filed this writ petition to quash the same with the consequential direction
to the 3rd respondent to disburse monthly salary and monetary benefits with
effect from 05.06.2009 except for the month of July 2013.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2.Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the petitioner
was appointed as a Tamil Pandit in Cathedral Higher Secondary School at
Tirunelveli, on 05.06.2009 in the vacancy caused due to the retirement of one
Kalanjiyam.  Since the petitioner was fully qualified as he has also got the
Bachelor degree in Tamil and also enrolled his name in the employment
exchange, he was considered to the said post managed and administered by the  
CSI division, Tirunelveli which is also a minority institution.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.He further submitted that one Mrs.Ruby Sujatha who was earlier
appointed in the place of Kalanjiam by an incompetent authority, was ousted
from the said post by the management by proceedings dated 01.09.2008.  The 
said order was challenged by Ruby Sujatha in W.P(MD)No.8052 of 2008.  
However, the said order of ousting Mrs.Ruby Sujatha was upheld by way of
dismissing the said writ petition on 28.05.2009.  Aggrieved by the same, she
filed W.A(MD)No.377 of 2009 on 26.03.2010.  As there was no any interim order
in the said writ appeal, proposals were sent on 29.07.2009 for approval of
the appointment of the petitioner, however, the 3rd respondent/District
Educational Officer, Tirunelveli, had kept the proposals pending without
passing any order, in view of the pendency of the writ appeal.  Subsequently,
the writ appeal was allowed reversing the order passed in W.P(MD)No.8052 of
2008.  Being aggrieved, the 4th respondent school took up the matter to the
Apex Court in SLP.Nos.16701-16705 of 2010 and the Hon'ble Apex Court has  
granted an order of status quo on 14.07.2010, in view thereof, the 3rd
respondent keeping in mind that the petitioner has been working continuously
in the school without salary for about 5 years, granted approval by
proceedings dated 17.07.2013.  Based on the approval granted to his
appointment, the petitioner has received his salary for the month of July
2013 from the respondents, but however, shortly the 3rd respondent has
cancelled the order of approval of his appointment without any reasonable
cause, therefore, the petitioner filed W.P(MD)No.14385 of 2013 and this Court
has granted an interim order of stay against the order dated 14.08.2013
cancelling the approval granted to the petitioner.  Again, the respondents
failed to pay salary, hence, the petitioner filed Contempt Petition No.1154
of 2013.  Finally, the writ petition was taken up along with contempt
petition and the impugned order cancelling the appointment of the petitioner
was set aside with a direction to the 3rd respondent to pass appropriate
order in respect of the petitioner's request for approval of his appointment.
Again, the 3rd respondent issued a show cause notice on 27.01.2014 calling
upon the petitioner to explain as to why his order of appointment should not
be cancelled, for which, the petitioner submitted a detailed explanation
dated 14.02.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.Although a detailed counter affidavit has been filed in an effort to
support the impugned order, this Court keeping in mind that the order passed
by the Hon'ble Apex Court in SLP.Nos.16701-16705 of 2010 dated 14.07.2010  
granting an order of status-quo which has given rise to the reinstatement of
the petitioner to the post of Tamil Pandit,  has to be obediently followed
till the disposal of the pending SLP, is inclined to direct the respondents
to comply with the order of status quo granted by the Apex Court.  While
maintaining the status quo, the 3rd respondent shall continue to pay the
salary since the petitioner has been working.  The arrears of salary shall be
paid to the petitioner within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt
of a copy of this order.
</p><p id="p_5">        For the reasons mentioned above, the impugned order is set aside and
the writ petition is allowed.  No costs.  It is made clear that this order is
subject to the result of the pending SLP.  Consequently, M.P(MD)Nos.1 to 3 of
2014 are closed.
