                                 The petitioner has preferred the instant petition for the grant

                     of anticipatory bail in a case registered against him along with his other

                     co-accused, vide FIR No.199 dated 29.07.2014, on accusation of having

                     committed the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/57393585/" id="a_1">Section 15(2)(3)</a> of The Indian

                     Medical Council Act, 1956 and <a href="/doc/1667388/" id="a_2">Sections 419</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_3">420</a> IPC, by the police of

                     through the record with their valuable help and deep consideration of the

                     entire matter, to my mind, the present petition for anticipatory bail

                     deserves to be accepted in this context.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                      CRM No.M-27956 of 2014                                                  2</span>
                               "Learned counsel, inter alia, contended that the petitioner has duly
                               passed the final year examination in Ayurved Acharya subject from
                               University of Rajasthan, which is clear from certificate dated 26.12.1997
                               (Annexure P-1).        Therefore, he was duly authorized to practice as
                               Ayurved doctor, as authorized by the Board of Indian Medicine
                               Rajasthan, by virtue of certificate dated 12.05.2011(Annexure P-2). The
                               argument is that the petitioner has been falsely implicated in this case by
                               the complainant, in order to wreak vengeance. Moreover, nothing is to
                               be recovered from him.
</p><p id="p_5">                                             Heard.
</p><p id="p_6">                                             Notice of motion be issued to the respondent, returnable for
                               03.09.2014.
</p><p id="p_7">                                          Meanwhile, the petitioner is directed to join the investigation
                               before the next date of hearing. In the event of his arrest, the Arresting
                               Officer would admit him to bail on his furnishing adequate bail and
                               surety bonds in the sum of `25,000/- to his satisfaction."

</p><p id="p_8">                     5.               At the very outset, on instructions from SI Ran Singh,

                     learned State Counsel has acknowledged the factual matrix and submitted

                     that the petitioner has already joined the investigation. He is no longer

                     required for further interrogation, at this stage. There is no history of his

                     previous involvement in any other criminal case.                       Moreover, all the

                     offences alleged against the accused are triable by the Court of

                     Magistrate. Even, since the prosecution has not yet submitted the final

                     police report(challan) against the accused, so, the conclusion of trial will

                     naturally take a long time.

<p id="p_9">                     6.               In the light of aforesaid reasons, taking into consideration the

                     totality of facts &amp; circumstances, emanating from the record, as discussed

                     here-in-above and without commenting further anything on merits, lest it

                     may prejudice the case of either side during the course of trial, the instant

                     petition for anticipatory bail is accepted. The interim(provisional) bail

                     same has been so recorded for a limited purpose of deciding the present

                     petition for pre-arrest bail. At the same time, in case, the petitioner does

                     not cooperate or join the investigation, the prosecution would be at
