             BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE REASONS FOR THE DECISION



1.</pre><p id="p_1">                The brief facts of this case as carved out from the complaint are

that the accused is well known to the complainant that therefore, he

approached the complainant on 06/08/2016 and requested the complainant

for financial assistance of Rs. 03 lacs as he was facing financial crises and

requested for urgent need of money for treatment of illness of his wife. That

accused assured the complainant that this money will be returned within a

period of three months. That considering the urgency of the circumstances

of the accused, old relations and having sympathetics view towards the

illness of wife of the accused, complainant gave Rs. 03 lacs on 06/08/2016 in

following manner:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     1. Rs. 1,28,000/- in cash for making urgent payment to the doctor and to

         meet with other medical requirements as requested by the accused.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     2. Cheque bearing no. 304279 dated 06/08/2016 for Rs. 1,06,000/- drawn

         on Corporation Bank, Begum Bridge Branch, Meerut, UP.

         on PNB, Jagriti VIhar, Meerut, UP.</blockquote><p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">                  That on presentation of the above said cheques the amount

was debited to the account of the complainant and credited in the account

of the accused. That accused did not return any amount to the complainant

 However, accused returned the sum of Rs. 01 lac only in two installments ie

Rs. 60,000/- through cheque bearing no. 835902 dated 13/12/2016 drawn on

SBI, Muzaffar Nagar, UP and Rs. 40,000/- by way of cheque dated

24/01/2017, drawn on SBI, Muzaffar Nagar, UP. That accused did not make

any payment thereafter despite several reminders.             That on 28/03/2017

accused visited the residence of the complainant and requested for another

sum of Rs. 20,000/- in cash to get the treasury bills cleared being the end of

financial year 2016-17.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                  That accused assured the complainant that entire balance of Rs.

2,20,000/- would be paid through cheque and said cheque will be honoured

on presentation. That in order to discharge of total liabilities, accused had

issued the cheque bearing no. 835882 dated 22/04/2017 for a sum of Rs.

2,20,000/- drawn on SBI, B.O. SNE, Railway Road, Muzaffar Nagar, UP

speed post, despite receipt of which, payment of the cheques in question

was not made by the accused within the stipulated time of 15 days. Hence,

record of the case meticulously.

ingredients are required to be fulfilled :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                  i)   That      there   is   legally   enforceable   debt      or    liability;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                  ii) The drawer of the cheque issued the cheque to discharge in

                  part or whole the said legally enforceable debt or liability;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                  iii) The cheque so issued was returned unpaid by the banker of the

                  accused failed to make the payment within15 days of the receipt

                  of the said notice.

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">

</blockquote><p id="p_17">8.                It is a well-settled position of law that when a negotiable

instrument is drawn, two statutory presumptions arise in favour of the

complainant, one under <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_15">Section 139</a> and other under <a href="/doc/1177058/" id="a_16">Section 118(a)</a> of the NI

Act. The court shall presume a negotiable instrument to be for consideration

unless and until after considering the matter before it, it either believes that

the consideration does not exist or considers the non-existence of the

consideration so probable that a prudent man ought, under the

circumstances of the particular case to act upon the supposition that the

consideration does not exist. For rebutting such presumption, what is

 needed is to raise a probable defence. Even for the said purpose, the

evidence adduced on behalf of the complainant could be relied upon.

(Reliance placed on <a href="/doc/533881/" id="a_18">M.S. Narayana Menon v. State of Kerala</a>, (2006) 6 SCC 39).



</p><p id="p_18">9.                <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_19">Section 138</a> Negotiable Instruments Act is attracted in cases

where any cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him to the

banker for payment of any amount of money to another person from out of

that account for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other

liability standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the

cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from the account

by an agreement made with that bank, such person shall be deemed to have

committed an offence.

14.      Points of determination:-

</pre><p id="p_25">      a) Whether there exists a legally recoverable debt?

</p><p id="p_26">      b) Whether the cheque in question was given in discharge of legally

         recoverable debt?
</p>
<p id="p_27">         Both the issues will be dealt together.
</p>
<p id="p_28">                  As per section 118 Presumptions as to negotiable instruments.

</p><p id="p_29">--Until the contrary is proved, the following presumptions shall be made:-

</p><p id="p_30">(a) of consideration - that every negotiable instrument was made or drawn

for consideration, and that every such instrument, when it has been

accepted, endorsed, negotiated or transferred, was accepted, endorsed,

negotiated or transferred for consideration;
</p>
<p id="p_31">                  There is a statutory presumption in favour of the complainant

with respect to existence of the debt and therefore, burden of proof lies in

upon the accused. The burden of proof to show that a legally recoverable

debt did not exist in favour of the complainant lies upon the accused.

</p><p id="p_32">                  It is brought out from the cross examination of the complainant


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"><a href="/doc/20098805/" id="a_22">Subodh Kumar Sharma vs Rakesh Kumar           CT Cases</a> 6770/17          Page 9 of 12</span>
 that he not aware as to what health problem wife of accused was having for

which he advanced him the loan of Rs. 3,00,000.Complainant stated that he

has advanced a loan of Rs 1,28,000/- by way of cash and remaining amount

by way of cheque as he did not have the amount of Rs.3,00,000/- in his bank

account on the said date. It is important to note that accused has admitted

that he has received the sum of Rs. 1,72,000/-. The question is raised on the

fact of Rs.1,28,000/- advanced by way of cash. Complainant has not placed on

record his bank account statement of the said date to prove the fact that the

sum of Rs.3,00,000/- was not available in his bank account on the said date

and therefore he advanced the sum of Rs.1,28,000/- by way of cash.It is

important to note here that no objection is raised on the financial capacity of

the complainant to advance this loan but on the fact whether any loan of Rs.

1,28,000/- was ever advanced in cash. The burden to prove this shifted on

the complainant however complainant at no stage produced any document

to prove the same.
</p>
<p id="p_33">                  Further on the aspect of reason of loan. Complainant state that

he gave the loan for the illness of the wife of the accused. It is stated by the

complainant that he is having friendly relations with the accused since

several years and it appears unreasonable that before advancing a big

amount of Rs. 3,00,000/- complainant is not aware exactly for which purpose

the loan is being given. It is also important to note that in the complaint, it is

stated that complainant requested the accused several times to make the

remaining payment, however accuse did not do so and after that also


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"><a href="/doc/20098805/" id="a_23">Subodh Kumar Sharma vs Rakesh Kumar        CT Cases</a> 6770/17    Page 10 of 12</span>
 complainant has advanced a sum of Rs. 20,000/- for clearance of the treasury

note. The occurrence of this event seems improbable as despite that there is

no receipt taken by the complainant stating that he has advanced the loan of

Rs. 3,00,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_34">                  Therefore, accused has able to raise a probable defence that

the loan of Rs. 3,00,000/- was not given to the complainant. Further,

probable defence is also accepted that no cash amount of Rs. 1,28,000/- was

advanced to the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_35">                  Coming on the aspect of issuance of cheque. It is the case of the

complainant that cheque was issued as for the payment of the remaining

amount and it was a PDC cheque. Per contra defence is taken by the accused

is that he issued an undated cheque. Accused stated that he was liable to pay

total amount of Rs. 2,20,000/- and cheque in question was given as security

of this amount. Out of Rs. 2,20,000/- he already paid the sum of Rs.

1,00,000/- and hence before he could pay the remaining amount of Rs.

1,20,000/- on agreed date of June, 2017, complainant presented the same

for encashment before that. Considering the observations made with

respect to the debt, accused has able to raise a probable defence that

cheque in question was issued as a security of the payment and the payment

was due In June 2017.
</p>
<p id="p_36">

</p><p id="p_37">15.               Conclusively, in light of the above discussions and reasons, this

court finds accused is not guilty of offence punishable U/s 138 of the Act.
