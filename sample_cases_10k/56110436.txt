Reliance Infratel Ltd.                                                            ......Petitioner

Sumiya Bano                                                                       .......Respondent

ORDER  :
</pre>
<p id="p_1">                  Vide this order,  I shall dispose off the present petition filed by the petition 

u/s 9 of Arbitration &amp; <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_1">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                  The   petitioner   has   filed   the   present   petition   for   an   interim   order   of 

protection in its favour  and against the respondent, her relatives and acquaintance, etc 

from   interfering,   creating   any   hindrance   /   obstructions   in   the   way   of   officials   of   the 

petitioner company in accessing the licensed premises i.e. 850 sq. feet of roof top of 

premises bearing   H. No. I­36, B/1 carved out of Khasra No. 257, Thokar No.4, Abdul 

Fazal   Enclave,   Part­I,   Delhi­25   (herein   after   referred   to   as   suit   property)   where 

telecommunication tower, D.G. Set and other related equipments have been installed by 

the petitioner company.  The restraint order is also sought against the respondent from 

causing   any   hindrance   or   obstruction   and   from   interfering   in   any   manner   in   the 

maintenance,   repair,   etc   of   Telecom   Antennae,   tower,   BTS   equipments,   D.G.   Sets 

installed in the suit property.  
</p>
<p id="p_3">                  The respondent was duly served, however, she chose not to appear and 

was proceeded ex­parte on 26.08.2011.     Copy of licence agreement is on record.     It 


                                                                                           Contd....P..1 of 3
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                   : 2 :</span>

was executed between the petitioner and respondent on 18.08.2008.   Under Clause 9, 

the license commenced on 18.08.2008 and shall remain in force for a period of 20 years 

i.e. till 17.08.2028.   Under clause 10   of the agreement,   the license fee of Rs.13,000/­ 

shall be increased by 15% at the expiry of 5 years of the last license fee paid.   Under 

clause 12 of the agreement, the licensor i.e. the respondent is under a duty to ensure 24 

hours a day access to the licensee, its employees, agents, associates, security guards, 

etc,  petitioner  herein  to  the  licensed  property   and  further   ensure   that  access  is  not 

denied   to   the   licensee,     its   employees,   agents,   associates,   security   guards,   etc, 

petitioner herein at any time including Sundays, national and other holidays and night 

time.  
</p>
<p id="p_4">                 The petitioner has submitted that respondent, since 02.07.2011, has been 

creating   hindrance   and   obstruction   in   the   way   of   officials   of   petitioner   company   in 

accessing   licensed   premises   and   again   on   07.07.2011.       The   respondent   on   being 

confronted by the officials of petitioner company did not give any plausible or satisfactory 

answer for creating hindrance and obstruction.   Petitioner had also issued a legal notice 

dated 15.07.11 to the respondent to refrain from creating such hindrance and to honour 

the terms of license agreement.    In view of the aforementioned clauses of the license 

agreement,  the petitioner has established a prima facie case in its favour.   Balance of 

convenience is also on the side of petitioner in view of terms of license as respondent 

has not  appeared before the  court  to point  towards  any  violation of terms  of  license 

agreement by petitioner.   The tenure of licence is for 20 years and respondent started 

creating obstruction when not even three years had completed, the petitioner is likely to 

suffer irreparable loss if access is not provided to the petitioner as prayed for.  

</p><p id="p_5">                 In view of the observations made herein, the present petition is allowed 


                                                                                       Contd....P..2 of 3
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                 : 3 :</span>

and  an interim  order  of  protection   is   granted  in  favour  of  petitioner  and against  the 

respondent, her relatives and acquaintance, etc from interfering, creating any hindrance / 

obstructions in the way of officials of the petitioner company in accessing the licensed 

premises i.e. 850 sq. feet of roof top of premises bearing  H. No. I­36, B/1 carved out of 

Khasra No. 257, Thokar No.4, Abdul Fazal Enclave, Part­I, Delhi­25 (herein after referred 

to   as   suit   property)   where   telecommunication   tower,   D.G.   Set   and   other   related 

equipments have been installed by the petitioner company.   The restraint order is also 

granted   against   the   respondent   from   causing   any   hindrance   or   obstruction   and   from 

interfering in any manner in the maintenance, repair, etc of Telecom Antennae, tower, 

BTS equipments, D.G. Sets  installed in the suit property.
