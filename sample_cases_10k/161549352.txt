</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">      In connection with New Market Police Station Case No. 101 of 2007, under

<a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_1">Section 307</a> of the Indian Penal Code, the petitioner was arrested by the police on
 April 15, 2007 and on the very next day, i.e. on April 16, 2007 when he was

produced before the Learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Calcutta he was

released on bail. The opposite party no. 2 herein, the defacto-complainant moved

the City Sessions Court, Calcutta for cancellation of bail, whereupon, the

Learned Chief Judge, City Sessions Court cancelled the petitioner's bail.

</p><p id="p_8">            Hence, this criminal revision against the order of cancellation of bail.

</p><p id="p_9">      2.    Heard the learned Counsels appearing on behalf of the parties.

Perused the Case Diary. Considered the case laws relied upon by them.

</p><p id="p_10">      3.    It is the submissions of the learned Counsel of the petitioner that the

Learned Magistrate was fully justified in granting bail to the petitioner as the

injury sustained by the defacto-complainant was simple in nature. He further

submitted that after being released on bail the petitioner has never misused his

liberty in any way whatsoever and as directed by this Hon'ble High Court he has

been regularly meeting the Investigating Officer of this case, on every day, since

May 19, 2009. According to the Counsel of the petitioner while the petitioner

reported to the Investigating Officer of the case he was thoroughly interrogated

and his statement has also been recorded. Thus, he prayed that the impugned

order whereby the petitioner's bail was cancelled by the Learned Chief Judge,

City Sessions Court be quashed and he be permitted to continue on bail as

granted by the Learned Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_11">            On the other hand, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the

defacto-complainant vehemently urged that the order of granting bail is wholly

against the materials on record and accordingly, the Learned Chief Judge, City
 Sessions Court very rightly set aside the same and cancelled the petitioner's bail.

He further submitted when the order of granting bail by itself is manifestly

erroneous and illegal, the post bail conduct of an accused has no relevance. In

support of his submission the learned Counsel appearing for the opposite party

no. 2 relied upon the following decisions;
</p>

</p>
<p id="p_14">            According to him the order impugned does not deserve any

interference.
</p>
<p id="p_15">            The Learned Public Prosecutor produced the Case Diary and

supplemented the contention of the learned lawyer of the defacto-complainant,

submitting that the nature of injury suffered by the defacto-complainant clearly
 attracts the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_2">Section 307</a> of the Indian Penal Code and

as such the Learned Magistrate was not justified to grant bail to the petitioner on

the very first day of his production in court.    The Learned Public Prosecutor

further submitted that during the course of investigation, the petitioner was

thoroughly interrogated by the police and his custodial interrogation is no more

necessary. According to him the investigation is almost complete and charge-

sheet will be submitted very shortly.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      4.    Now having considered the materials available from the Case Diary

and the statement of the defacto-complainant, the injured herself and the

witnesses, who were present at the time of alleged occurrence, I have no doubt

that the findings of the Learned Magistrate is totally against the materials on

record and wholly erroneous.      The conclusion of the Learned Magistrate as

regards to the offence committed by the petitioner on the face of the materials is

not correct. I find that the victim was assaulted by the present petitioner with an

iron rod on her head and such injury was repaired by as many as 14 stitches. I

further find from the statement of the witnesses recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_3">Section 161</a> of

the Code of Criminal Procedure that the accused pounced on the injured saying

that he would kill her. It was the further statement of the witnesses at that time

the accused was also carrying a knife but could not use the same due to the

timely intervention of the local residents. As such, even if, it is found that the

nature of injuries suffered by the victim are simple in nature that does not mean

the offence under <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_4">Section 307</a> of the Indian penal Code would elude. In a case

where the allegation is one of attempt to commit murder, it is not essential that
 the bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted, but the

intention of the accused would be the deciding factor. Necessarily the nature of

weapon used, the portion of the body where the injuries were inflicted coupled

with the overact in execution of the offence ought to be taken into consideration

irrespective of its result. Merely because the injuries inflicted on the victim are

simple in nature that cannot take the case out of the ambit of offence punishable

under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_5">Section 307</a> of the Indian Penal Code.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      5.    Indisputably, it is always open to a superior Court to reverse any

order of granting bail to an accused by any subordinate court and cancel the

same when it is found that such order of granting bail is vitiated by complete

misconception of law or misreading of materials on record or on a wrong

assumption. In such a situation, absence of supervening circumstances is of no

significance. In the instant case, the reason assigned for granting bail, in my

opinion, is also not correct. However, in view of the fact already two and half

months have been elapsed from the date of granting bail to the petitioner and

when admittedly the petitioner is no longer required by the Investigating Agency

for the purpose of custodial interrogation and according to the submissions of

the Learned Public Prosecutor, the investigation is almost complete and charge-

sheet is likely to be filed very shortly, even though order of granting bail is not

proper and erroneous, still I am of the opinion, at the present stage there will be

no justification to uphold the impugned order, whereby the petitioner's bail has

been cancelled by the Learned Chief Judge, City Sessions Court, Calcutta. It is

also pertinent to note neither the State nor the defacto-complainant before this
 Court expressed any apprehension about the likelihood of petitioner's absconsion

or of tampering with the evidence. Accordingly, the impugned order whereby the

Learned Chief Judge, City Sessions Court, Calcutta cancelled the petitioner's bail

is set aside and the order passed by the Learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,

Calcutta on April 16, 2007, granting bail to him is restored, however subject to

the condition that the petitioner shall attend the concerned police station thrice

in every week until further order.
</p>
<p id="p_18">            However, the court below is directed to supply the copy of the police

papers to the accused within a month from the date of submission of charge-

sheet and shall make all endeavours to commence the trial within two months

thereafter and conclude the same as expeditiously as possible. The court shall

proceed with the trial on day to day basis and must not grant any adjournment

to either parties unless granting of adjournment is found necessary for ends of

justice.
</p>
<p id="p_19">            Criminal Section is directed to deliver urgent Photostat certified copy

of this Judgement to the parties, if applied for, as early as possible.
