that the prosecutrix was pregnant carrying 24 weeks pregnancy.  PW­13 

has duly identified the handwriting and signatures of Dr. Shilpi Rathore.  

Statement and Defence of accused :­

18            Statement of accused under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_18">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C was recorded 

wherein the accused denied the case of the prosecution and stated that it 

is a false case made by the complainant.   Prosecutrix has disclosed her

 age to him as 19 years when she accompanied him.  She called him and 

voluntarily accompanied him.   They both went to Arya Samaj Mandir, 

Jamuna   Bazar   and   had   married   each   other.   They   both   are   residing 

together as husband and wife and are also blessed with a baby boy from 

their   wedlock.   Accused   further   stated   that   he   does   not   wish   to   lead 

defence evidence.      
</p>
<p id="p_13">19             I have heard the Ld. Defence counsel for the accused and Ld.  

APP for state and have carefully perused the record. 

Arguments of Ld. APP for state:­

20             Ld. APP for state has argued that as per the school record 

prosecutrix is minor which is duly proved on record by PW­5 Sh. Heera 

Lal.   Hence,   even if she states of voluntarily accompanied the accused 

and of consensual sex it is not material and as such, the accused may be 

convicted.
</p>
<p id="p_14">Arguments of Ld. Defence Counsel for accused:­

21                 On the other hand, Ld. Defence counsel for accused argued 

that   prosecutrix   and   accused   have   married   each   other   and   now   living 

together   and   blessed   with   a   child.   He   further   argued   that   both   the 

prosecutrix and her parents have turned hostile and as such, the statement 

of prosecutrix and her parents is not believable and the accused may be 

acquitted.  He has also argued that prosecutrix is major and has willingly 

accompanied the accused  and married him and as such, no offence is

 made out. 
</p>
<p id="p_15">Conclusion:­

22                    Before appreciating the facts of this case,it is necessary to 

know the ingredients of the offence by resorting to the provisions of sec.

375 read with sec.376 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_19">IPC</a>. Section 375 Rape provides:­ " A man is said to 

commit "rape" who, except in the case hereinafter excepted, has sexual 

intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling under any of the 

six following descriptions:­

               First­ Against her will.
</p>
<p id="p_16">               Secondly­ Without her consent.
</p>
<p id="p_17">               Thirdly­  With   her   consent,   when   her   consent   has   been 

obtained by putting her or any person in whom she is interested in fear of 

death or of hurt.
</p>
<p id="p_18">               Fourthly­ With her consent, when the man knows that he is 

not her husband, and that her consent is given because she believes that 

he   is   another   man   to   whom   she   is   or   believes   herself   to   be   lawfully 

married.
</p>
<p id="p_19">               Fifthly­  With her consent, when, at the time of giving such 

consent,   by   reason   of   unsoundness   of   mind   or   intoxication   or   the 

administration by him personally or through another of any stupefying or 

unwholesome   substance,   she   is   unable   to   understand   the   nature   and 

consequences of that to which she gives consent.  


SC No. 13/12               State Vs Dilip Kumar                       Page No. 10 of 16
                 Sixthly­ With or without her consent, when she under sixteen 

years of age. 
</p>
<p id="p_20">                Explanation­ Penetration is sufficient to constitute the sexual 

intercourse necessary to the offence of rape.  
</p>
<p id="p_21">                Exception­  Sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, 

the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape.  

</p><p id="p_22">                  "Rape" is the act of physically forcing a woman to have 

sexual   intercourse:   an   act   of   sexual   intercourse   that   is   forced   upon   a 

woman against her will.  "Statutory rape" is a sexual intercourse with a 

girl under the age of consent, which age varies in different States from 

ten to eighteen years. 
</p>
<p id="p_23">                   The offence of rape in its simplest term is 'the ravishment 

of a woman, without her consent, by force, fear or fraud', or as 'the carnal 

knowledge of a woman by force against her will? 'Rape' or 'Raptus' is 

when a man hath carnal knowledge of a woman by force and against her 

will   (Co.   lett.   123­b);   or   as   expressed   more   fully,   'rape'   is   the   carnal 

knowledge of any woman, above the age of particular years, against her 

will;   or   of   a   woman   child,   under   that   age,   with   or   against   her   will. 

<a href="/doc/623254/" id="a_20">Section   375</a>   IPC   defines   rape.   This   Section   requires   the   following 

essentials:­

</p><p id="p_24">                1. Sexual intercourse by a man with woman.
</p>
<p id="p_25">                2. The   sexual   intercourse   must   be   under   circumstances 


SC No. 13/12               State Vs Dilip Kumar                         Page No. 11 of 16
                     falling under any of the six clauses in <a href="/doc/623254/" id="a_21">Section 375</a> IPC.  

23             The two issues to be determined on the basis of evidence 

adduced by the prosecution are the age of the prosecutrix and whether she 

was a consenting party to the incident or not.  
</p>
<p id="p_26">24             Age of the prosecutrix:­     As per the prosecution case, the 

prosecutrix was aged around 14 years when she was taken by the accused. 

To prove the age of the prosecutrix, prosecution has examined PW­5 Sh. 

Heera   Lal,   Lab   Assistant,   Government   Girls   Secondary   School, 

Trilokpuri,  Block­27, Delhi who had produced the school record wherein 

the date of birth of the prosecutrix is mentioned as 25.04.1997.  However, 

in his cross examination he has admitted that the date of birth was entered 

in   their   school   records   on   the   oral   submissions   of   the   parents   of   the 

prosecutrix.  The parents of the prosecutrix on the other hand have turned 

hostile.  Both have stated that their daughter is aged about 16 years at the 

time of incident.   The mother of the prosecutrix has specifically stated 

that   her   daughter   was   born   in   village   and   her   date   of   birth   was   not 

registered in any government authority, so they got recorded her date of 

birth on guess basis.  Father of the prosecutrix has also stated that at the 

time of incident, his daughter was aged around 15­16 years and not of 14 

years and that he has stated the age of his daughter as 14 years in the 

complaint in a hurry at that time.  On the similar lines, the prosecutrix/ 

PW­8 has stated that her actual age was more than as shown in the school 


SC No. 13/12               State Vs Dilip Kumar                       Page No. 12 of 16
 records and that her parents got recorded less age in the school records to 

secure admission in the school.  She has stated that she was more than 17 

years   of   age   at   the   time   she   went   with   the   accused.     In   view   of   the 

statement of the prosecutrix and her parents, the school records of the 

prosecutrix   cannot   be   given   any   weightage   as   the   parents   of   the 

prosecutrix who are the supplier of information of the date of birth of the 

prosecutrix   in   the   school   records   have   themselves   stated   that   the   age 

recorded   in   the   school   records   is   based   on   guess   and   that   when   the 

prosecutrix went with the accused she was about 16 years of age.   The 

court is not oblivious of the fact that in villages there is a tendency of 

mentioning   the   less   age   of   children   in   school   records   by   the   parents. 

Though, as per law the school records are treated as the authentic proof of 

the date of birth of a student but when the school record is not based on 

any document like birth certificate issued from MCD or any government 

agency   and   is   based   upon   the   affidavit   /   information   supplied   by   the 

parents   of   a   child   who   themselves   have   not   authenticated   the   school 

records, in my considered opinion such school records cannot be given 

any weightage and cannot be taken as an authentic proof of the date of 

birth.   The parents of a child are the only source of information with 

regard to the date of birth of a child and the statement of the parents is 

more   authentic   and   believable   moreso   when   there   is   no   other 

contradictory evidence, documentary, medical or otherwise to rebut the 



SC No. 13/12               State Vs Dilip Kumar                         Page No. 13 of 16
 statement of the parents.   Accordingly, in view of the statement of the 

prosecturix and her parents it is held that the prosecutrix was 16 years of 

age at the time of incident. 
</p>
<p id="p_27">25             Consent of the prosecutrix:­   As per the statement of the 

prosecutrix, she had voluntarily gone with the accused and had married 

and had sexual intercourse with him with her own willingness.   She is 

now staying with the accused and is also blessed with a baby boy from 

the wedlock of the accused. The prosecution has also examined a witness 

PW­11 Sh. Niranjan Vashishtha, a priest in this matter who got performed 

the marriage of the prosecutrix with the accused in Arya Samaj Mandir. 

The   marriage   certificate   is   also   proved   on   record   by   the   prosecution 

witness.   Since the prosecutrix was aged 16 years of age at the time of 

incident and in view of her statement that she voluntarily accompanied 

the   accused   and   had   made   physical   relations   with  him   voluntarily,  no 

offence under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_22">section 376</a> IPC is made out against the accused. 

Offence of Kidnapping:­

26             For the offence under <a href="/doc/619940/" id="a_23">section 363</a> of IPC, the prosecution has 

to prove the ingredients of the offence as mentioned in <a href="/doc/1515807/" id="a_24">section 361</a> of IPC 

i.e.:­ 

</p><p id="p_28">               i) taking or enticing a minor girl under 18 years of age,

</p><p id="p_29">               ii) Out of the keeping of lawful guardian of such minor,

 Offence under <a href="/doc/796352/" id="a_25">section 366</a> IPC:­

27               For   proving   the   offence   under   <a href="/doc/796352/" id="a_26">section   366</a>   IPC   the 

prosecution has to prove the following ingredients. 

</p><p id="p_32">                 The essential ingredients of <a href="/doc/796352/" id="a_27">section 366</a> of IPC are :­ 

</p><p id="p_33">                 (a) A person kidnaps or abducts any woman. 
</p>
<p id="p_34">                 (b) The act is done­

</p><p id="p_35">                 (i) with intent that she may be compelled to marry any person 

against her will, or

</p><p id="p_36">                 (ii) knowing it to be likely that she will be so compelled, or

</p><p id="p_37">                    (iii)   in   order   that   she   may   be   forced   or   seduced   to   illicit 

intercourse, or 

</p><p id="p_38">                   (iv) knowing it to be likely that she will be so forced or 

seduced. 
</p>
<p id="p_39">28               As per the discussion above the prosecutrix was 16 years of 

age at the time of incident and as she was less than 18 years of age,  she is 

minor so far as <a href="/doc/619940/" id="a_28">section 363</a>/<a href="/doc/796352/" id="a_29">366</a> IPC are concerned. As per the statement 

of the prosecutrix she has gone with the accused voluntarily, married him 

and made physical relations with him voluntarily. The accused has also 

admitted in his statement that prosecutrix herself had accompanied him. 

The mother of the prosecutrix had also stated that her husband had lodged 

a missing report in the police station when her daughter did not return 

home in the evening.  Hence, it is proved that prosecutrix was kidnapped

 by the accused out of the lawful guardianship of her parents and without 

their consent and with the intention that she will be compelled to marry 

the accused and to have illicit intercourse with him. Hence, <a href="/doc/619940/" id="a_30">section 363</a> 

IPC   and   <a href="/doc/796352/" id="a_31">section   366</a>   IPC   are   proved   against   the   accused   beyond 

reasonable doubt.

<p id="p_40">29           In view of the above said facts and circumstances, accused 

Dilip Kumar is held guilty and convicted for the offence under <a href="/doc/619940/" id="a_32">section
