        CORAM:
        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIPIN SANGHI


VIPIN SANGHI, J. (OPEN COURT)
</pre><p id="p_1">1.      The petitioner has preferred the present bail application under Section
439 Cr PC for grant of bail in Session Case no.23/14 pending trial in the
court of Sh. Deepak Garg, Special Judge, <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1">NDPS Act</a> arising out of FIR
No.14/14, PS Special Cell.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.      The submission of learned counsel for the petitioner is that no
recovery has been affected from the petitioner and the petitioner was not
even apprehended at the spot. He submits that the secret information which
allegedly pertained to the petitioner-to the effect that petitioner would make
delivery of the contraband substance, was not found to be correct, since the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">BAIL APPLN. 534/2015                                          Page 1 of 8</span>
 petitioner was not present at the spot and was not apprehended at the time of
the alleged transaction. He places reliance on the judgment of the Supreme
Court in <a href="/doc/1521187/" id="a_2">Chenna Boyanna Krishna Yadav v. State of Maharashtra</a>, 2007 I
AD (SC) 119, to submit that merely because he was allegedly in
conversation with the accused Georgii Dedov, it cannot be inferred that the
petitioner was involved in the supply of the contraband substance to Georgii
Dedov. He also places reliance on the judgment of this Court in Karan
Singh v. State, Bail Appl. No.1223/2006 decided on 17.05.2006 to submit
that, since the petitioner had been arrested on the ground of secret
information regarding his links with the co-accused, the secret information
was inadmissible unless and until the provider of such information is
examined in the court.     He submits that in the present case, the secret
informer has not been named as a prosecution witness and he has not been
examined and the mere mention of the name of the petitioner in the secret
information cannot be a reason to prosecute the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.    On the other hand, the learned APP, on the basis of status report filed
in the case, submits that there was specific information that the petitioner
would come to Karol Bagh, Delhi along with his other associates in a Alto
Car to deliver the consignment of narcotic drugs/substance to one of his
associates of Russian nationality Georgii Dedov at 11:00 a.m. on
26.03.2014. Accordingly, a raid was conducted and three accused persons
including one foreign national, Georgii Dedov resident of Moscow, with co-
accused Anil Kumar @ Nillu and Anil Kumar @ Lucky, both residents of
Himachal Pradesh were apprehended. Both Anil Kumar @ Nillu and Anil
Kumar @ Lucky reached there in Alto car having registration no.HP01




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">BAIL APPLN. 534/2015                                          Page 2 of 8</span>
 D3703(which was the same as contained in the secret information), and
handed over the consignment of narcotic drugs/substances (charas/hashish)
to the above said Russian national. The recovered narcotic drugs were found
to be weighing 2.210 kgs-which is a commercial quantity. Accordingly, the
FIR in question was registered and the three persons were arrested. During
their interrogation, it was revealed that the consignment of recovered
narcotic drugs was sent by the petitioner, a resident of Distt. Kanga,
Himachal Pradesh through Anil Kumar @ Nillu and Anil Kumar @ Lucky
for delivery to Georgii Dedov.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.    The status report states that during investigation, it was revealed that
the accused Georgii Dedov was in constant touch with the petitioner since
long, and the Russian national used to receive drugs, and had received drugs
form the petitioner earlier also. It was also revealed that Georgii Dedov had
also sent part payment for the recovered drugs through banking channel,
which was credited to the account of one Manjeet Singh.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.    The status report further states that a number of telephone calls
between the petitioner and Georgii Dedov were intercepted after obtaining
permission of the competent authority, and the conversation revealed that
the transaction in question - for delivery of drugs by the petitioner, through
his associates, to Georgii Dedov had been planned. The voice sample of the
petitioner and Georgii Dedov have also matched as per the report of experts
of CFSL. The status report states that the petitioner was using several
mobile phone numbers, which were deliberately not obtained by him in his
own name. While one was in the name of a student, the others were in the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">BAIL APPLN. 534/2015                                         Page 3 of 8</span>
 name of his employees. The call detail records also disclose that the
petitioner was in Delhi at the time of the transaction in question.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.    The prosecution has enlisted several witnesses, which includes
Manjeet Singh - the person in whose account the money has been received
from Georgii Dedov for the transaction in question; the employees of the
petitioner-in whose names the mobile numbers were obtained and were
being used by the petitioner, and; the other persons who were staying with
the petitioner at a hotel in Karol Bagh, Delhi, or have seen the petitioner stay
at the hotel in Karol Bagh, Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.    Learned APP submits that the evidence of these witnesses is yet to be
recorded and the release of the petitioner at this stage may result in these
witnesses being approached and the evidence being tampered. He further
submits that the petitioner was apprehended only after issuance of non
bailable warrant since he was absconding, and releasing him at this stage
may result him again fleeing from the law.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.    Having heard learned counsel, perused the record and the decisions
relied upon, I am not inclined to allow this application.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.    Each case has to be viewed and decided on its own facts.               The
decisions relied upon by the petitioner in Chenna Boyanna Krishna Yadav
(supra) and Karan Singh (supra) cannot be applied in the facts of the present
case, which have been noticed herein above.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.   In Chenna Boyanna Krishna Yadav (supra), a micro audio cassette
was recovered from the premises of one of the accused, namely, Telgi. The
said cassette contained recording of alleged conversation between the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">BAIL APPLN. 534/2015                                           Page 4 of 8</span>
 appellant and Telgi.    As noticed hereinabove, in the present case, the
conversation between the petitioner and Georgii Dedov was intercepted with
prior authority by the police itself. In Chenna Boyanna Krishna Yadav
(supra), the case of the prosecution - based on the cassette recording, was
that the appellant had demanded ransom of Rs. 2 crore from Telgi of the
release of two of his employees. The deal had materialized and the appellant
came closer to Telgi. The allegation was that friendship had developed
between the appellant and Telgi, as a result whereof, the appellant rendered
active support and help to Telgi in his alleged unlawful activities of
organized crime syndicate in the State of Andhra Pradesh, relating to
printing of counterfeit stamps and other documents and sale thereof. The
High Court while rejecting the bail application of the appellant had
concluded that, prima facie, there was material on record to show that the
appellant had knowledge about the continued organized crime of printing
and selling fake stamps by Telgi. This prima facie conclusion was founded
upon statements of some of the witnesses and the said tape recorded
conversation between the appellant and Telgi.
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.   The appellant had argued before the Supreme Court that on the basis
of the statements of the witness and the tape recorded conversation between
the appellant and Telgi, no inference could be drawn that appellant was a
party to the conspiracy, or had abetted commission or facilitation of the
crime with which Telgi or other co-accused were associated. The allegation
of demand of ransom of Rs. 2 crores by the appellant from Telgi had no
nexus with the principal offence alleged under MCOCA. The Supreme
Court while granting bail to the appellant, inter alia, observed as follows:
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">BAIL APPLN. 534/2015                                          Page 5 of 8</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "As noted above, the circumstance which has weighed with the
      High Court to conclude that the appellant had knowledge of
      Organized Crime Syndicate of Telgi, printing fake stamps etc.
      and these were being sold under hte protection of the appellant
      and hence he had abetted an organzed crime, is the alleged
      conversation between him and Telgi in January, 1998, after the
      kidnapping incident. In our view, the alleged conversation may
      show appellant's acquaintance with Telgi but may not per se be
      sufficient to prove appellant's direct role with the commission
      of an organized crime by Telgi, to bring home an offence of
      betment in the commission of organized crime falling within the
      ambit of Section 3(2) of MCOCA and/or that he had rendered
      any help or support in the commission of an organized crime
      whether before or after the commission of such offence by a
      member of an organized crime syndicate or had abstained from
      taking lawful measures under MCOCA, thus, falling within the
      purview of Section 24 of MCOCA."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">12.   Thus, on the basis of the tape recorded conversation attributed to the
appellant and Telgi, it was prima facie held that, per se, the said
conversation may not be sufficient to prove the appellant's direct role with
the commission of an organized crime by Telgi to bring home an offence of
abetment in the commission of organized crime falling within the ambit of
Section 3(2) of MCOCA. In contradistinction, in the present case, the
telephonic conversation between the petitioner and Georgii Dedov was
intercepted with the prior authority.    Moreover, the petitioner has not
disputed the case of the respondent disclosed in the status report, that the
said conversation was regarding the demand and supply of the recovered
consignment and that the said conversation shows that the recovered drugs
were actually sent by the petitioner through his associates/co-accused




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">BAIL APPLN. 534/2015                                        Page 6 of 8</span>
 persons Anil Kumar @ Nillu and Anil Kumar @ Lucky. Pertinently, in
Chenna Boyanna Krishna Yadav (supra), the Supreme Court took note of
Jayendra Saraswathi Swamigal Vs. State of Tamil Nadu (2005) 2 SCC 13,
where the Supreme Court observed that, '..the nature and seriousness of the
offence; the character of the evidence; circumstances which are peculiar to
the accused; a reasonable possibility of the presence of the accused not
being secured at the trial; reasonable apprehension of witnesses being
tampered with; the larger interest of the public or the State and other
similar factors which may be relevant in the facts and circumstances of the
case.", while dealing with a bail application. The Supreme Court also
observed in Chenna Boyanna Krishna Yadav (supra) that when the gravity
of the offence alleged is severe, mere period of incarceration or the fact that
the trial is not likely to be concluded in the near future, either by itself, or
conjointly, may not entitle the accused to be enlarged on bail. Thus, the
judgment in Chenna Boyanna Krishna Yadav (supra) does not advance the
case of the petitioner as it is clearly distinguishable on facts.       On the
contrary, the legal proposition taken note of in the said decision goes against
the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_13">13.   Since the prosecution is not relying solely on the secret information
qua the petitioner's involvement in the offence in question, the decision in
Karan Singh Vs. State (supra) has no application.
</p>
<p id="p_14">14.   The prosecution witnesses include Manjit Singh - the recipient of the
part payment in relation to the recovered consignment of drugs; the
ostensible subscribers of the several mobile phones allegedly used by the
petitioner - which include his employees; three friends of the petitioner who




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">BAIL APPLN. 534/2015                                           Page 7 of 8</span>
 were allegedly with him on 26.03.2014. They are all material witnesses who
are yet to be examined. The release of the petitioner at this stage on bail is
most likely to result in the said witnesses - known to the petitioner, being
subjected to influence. There is certainly real apprehension of evidence
being tampered with. Consequently, the petitioner is not entitled to bail on
account of the said consideration in the light of the observation made by the
Supreme Court in Jayendra Saraswathi Swamigal (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_15">15.   The petitioner absconded, and was arrested only upon issuance of
NBWs. His release on bail may see him, once again, evade the process of
law. On this account as well, in my view, he is not entitled to bail.
Consequently, the present bail application is dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_16">16.   It is hoped that the Trial Court shall expedite the trial and complete
the recording of evidence of all the public witnesses without any delay. The
petitioner shall also cooperate in this regard.
</p>
