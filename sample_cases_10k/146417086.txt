</p><p id="p_6">5.    The prosecution in support of its case has examined 1 witness

incriminating evidence found against the accused his statement

u/S.313 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3">Cr.P.C</a>. was dispensed with.

counsel for accused and perused the records.

</p><p id="p_9">7.        The points for consideration is:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">          1.     Whether the prosecution proves beyond
          doubt that the accused on 24/8/2017 at about 12.45
          AM in the midnight at Domlur Love Shake Lunch
          Bar, Bengaluru when CW.1 requested all the
          customers to go out of the bar as it was closing
          time, the accused without any reason wrongfully
          restrained CW.1, pickedup quarrel with him and
          assaulted him with hands voluntarily causing hurt
          and without there being any provocation abused
          him in filthy language as 'bolimagne and
          sulemagne' and threatened him with dire
          consequences and thereby committed the alleged
          offence?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">          2. What order?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">8.        My answer on the above points:
</p>
<p id="p_11">             Point No.1 - Negative,

             Point No.2 - As per final order,

for the following;

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                 REASONS

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     9.     POINT NO.1:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">           The prosecution in support of its case has examined

complainant Mohan Kumar as PW.1. He turned hostile to the case of

the prosecution by denying any wrongful restrainment and assault
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                       4             CC No.53654/2018</span>

made with hands by the accused to him. He has also denied any abuse

made in filthy language and threat to life by accused to him. He also

denied having made complaint before the police under Ex.P1 and

drawing of mahazar in his presence under Ex.P2. In the evidence of

PW.1 deposed that he has compromised the dispute with accused and

as such the prayer of Sr.APP to summon and examine remaining

chargesheet witnesses was refused and they were dropped. Since the

material witness PW.1 turned hostile and compromise being reported

between the parties, it cannot be held that prosecution has been able to

prove the alleged offences beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I

answer Point No.1 in the Negative.

<p id="p_12">10.   POINT NO.2:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      For the afore said reasons, I pass the following;
