                         Mr. S. K. Kapur, Sr. Advocate
                         Mr. Tirthankar Ghosh

                         Mr. S. S. Banerjee
                         Mr. K. K. Maiti
                                     .......For the Opposite Party


                          The petitioner is praying for bail under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> of the

                   Code of Criminal Procedure in connection with case No.-TR-

                   63/15 under <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">Section 9A</a> (1<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_3">A) of the Central Excise Act</a>, 1944

                   pending before the court of learned Additional Chief Judicial

                   Magistrate, Alipore, South 24 Parganas.

</p><p id="p_3">                          Mr. Kapur, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of

                   the petitioner contends that the petitioner has the business of

                   both manufacturing and trading and the demand of excise duty

                   was     made    for   the   year   2001-2005   by   amalgamating

                   manufacturing unit with trading unit and the said issue is

                   pending before the Customs, Excise &amp; Service Tax Appellate

                   Tribunal, East Zonal Branch, Calcutta. He further submits that

                   the petitioner responded to the notice served on him for

                   interrogation and the petitioner attended the office of the

                   Investigating Agency on six different occasions from April 4, 2014

                   onwards and on seventh occasion on August 3, 2015, the
 petitioner was interrogated and thereby arrested and kept in

custody. Mr. Kapur further submits that the petitioner is aged

about sixty years and he has been suffering from blood sugar for

which he has to take insulin before taking food. Relying on the

decision of the Supreme Court in "<a href="/doc/2982624/" id="a_4">Arnesh Kumar V. State of

Bihar</a> reported in (2014) 8 SCC 273 Mr. Kapur has urged this

court to consider whether the petitioner can be detained in

custody in connection with an offence which is punishable with

imprisonment up to seven years. Mr. Kapur also submits that

the petitioner is willing to cooperate with the Investigating

Agency even if he is released on bail.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      Mr. Banerjee, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

Central Excise, Union of India contends that the petitioner

evaded excise duty to the tune of Rs.4,19,33,528/- and the

investigation is still in progress to ascertain the total amount of

excise duty evaded by the petitioner by projecting imaginary

manufacturing units. Mr. Banerjee further submits that out of

twenty-nine days of judicial custody of the petitioner, the

Investigating Agency did not get the opportunity to interrogate

the petitioner though attempt was made on three occasions by

submitting formal application before the Superintendent of the

Correctional   Home    seeking   permission   to   interrogate   the

petitioner who was all along in the hospital. Mr. Banerjee also

submits that the wife of the petitioner being another Director of

the Company did not respond to the notice served on her and as

such the Investigating Agency is at a loss to make full discovery
 of fact in course of investigation.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      I have perused the case diary and the materials available

in the case diary.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      The proposition of law laid down by the Supreme Court in

"<a href="/doc/2982624/" id="a_5">Arnesh Kumar V. State of Bihar</a>" (supra) is that any person

who is accused of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a

term which may extend up to seven years may not be arrested if

he can be interrogated after service of notice under <a href="/doc/1899251/" id="a_6">Section 41</a> of

the Code of Criminal Procedure.          It is apparent from the

materials on record that the present petitioner was interrogated

on several dates since April 4, 2014, but ultimately he was

arrested on August 3, 2015 for the purpose of custodial

interrogation.   It is also not disputed that the petitioner is

suffering from various ailments including blood sugar and he is

aged about sixty years old.       Since there is an allegation of

evading excise duty to the tune of Rs. 4,19,33,528/- there is

need of interrogation of the petitioner for full discovery of facts

during investigation of the case.       This interrogation can be

carried out even if the petitioner is released on bail.

</p><p id="p_7">      Having heard the learned counsel representing both

parties   and    on    consideration    of   the    background   of

commencement of the criminal proceeding against the petitioner

and the period of detention of the petitioner in custody and the

fact that the petitioner is suffering from various ailments, I am

inclined to release the petitioner on bail on some conditions.

</p><p id="p_8">      Accordingly, the petitioner Shri Ashok Kumar Chokhani is
 released on bail upon furnishing bond of Rs.50,000/- with two

sureties of Rs.25,000/- each to the satisfaction of learned

Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Alipore, South 24 Parganas

on condition that the petitioner will report to the Inspector,

Central Excise Commissionerate -V twice in a week and the

petitioner will not leave the territorial jurisdiction of Karaya

Police Station without the permission of the Investigating Officer

of the case till completion of investigation.

</p><p id="p_9">      The application for bail is, thus, allowed.

       Prayer of learned counsel for the Central Excise, Union of

India to stay the operation of the order for a limited period is

refused.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for,
be given to the parties on priority basis after compliance with all
necessary formalities.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
