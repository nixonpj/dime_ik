                  for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_1">Sections 406</a>,<a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_2">420</a> and <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_3">120B</a> of

<p id="p_3">                         The prosecution case is that the petitioners entered into an

                  agreement for sale of land in favour of the informant for

                  consideration of Rs.14,50,000/-, out of which Rs.13,00,000/-

                  were paid partly through banking transaction and partly in cash

                  but subsequently, the informant came to know that the land in

                  question has already been hypothecated with the Bank of India

                  and hence the informant sought to get back the money which he

                  had advanced to the petitioners, but since the same has not been

                  returned, hence the present case has been registered.

                It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioners that

         the petitioners admit the execution of agreement but the amount

         paid to them was Rupees Ten Lacs and not Thirteen Lacs but in

         view of the fact that a submission was made on behalf of the

         petitioners before the learned court below that they are ready to

         return the amount of Rupees Thirteen Lacs in installments, he is

         not in a position to retract from that undertaking.

         petitioners and submits that similar was the offer of the

         petitioners before the learned court below but the same was not

         complied.

         for the petitioners submits that the said amount of Rs. Thirteen

         Lacs will be paid in six monthly equal installments, out of

         which, first installment will be deposited in the bank account of

         the informant in the month of December, 2018 before executing the

         bail bonds on such terms. Both sides further agree to file appropriate

         application before the learned court below to the extent that they

         have resolved the issue and they do not want to pursue the case.

</p><p id="p_6">                      Considering the present stand of the parties,     let the

         petitioners above named be released on provisional anticipatory

         bail for six months in the event of arrest or surrender within six

                  with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of

                  the learned ACJM II, Danapur                 in connection with Naubatpur

                  anticipatory bail of the petitioners if the rest of the installments

                  are paid to the informant through banking transaction.
