JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">       Vide this judgment I shall dispose off the instant appeal filed by the
appellant against the respondent challenging the order of Ld. Trial Court
dated 11.1.11 vide which the suit of the plaintiff/respondent was decreed
against the defendant/appellant. The facts in this case are that initially a
simple civil suit for recovery of amount of Rs.2,67,461/- was filed against


RCA-06/11                                                            Page:-1/3
 the defendant but Ld. Trial Court on receiving the suit had inadvertently
issued the notice u/o 37 CPC on which application of appearance was filed
by the defendant . On 21.12.06 and thereafter case was adjourned for
further proceedings for 18.4.07 and the summons of judgment were
required to be issued. Thereafter defendant after filing appearance did not
appear and was also not required to appear but on 18.4.07 order for
filing written statement was passed and thereafter on 30.7.07 the
defendant was proceeded ex-parte. Thereafter case was fixed for ex-parte
evidence and thereafter for final arguments. On 15.1.09 when the case
after hearing arguments was fixed for orders for 23.1.09, the same day
i.e. on 15.1.09 Cl. for defendant appeared         at about 2.55 p.m and
apprised the court that appearance was filed by him and summons of
judgment were required to be issued but inadvertently he has been
proceeded ex-parte. On the next date of hearing when whole facts were
again disclosed to the court the defendant sought time to file appropriate
application which was filed by the defendant but the same was dismissed
on 23.11.10 and eventually the suit was decreed on 11.1.11. It is against
this judgment and decree the appellant has come before this court in
appeal.     Undoubtedly the facts are crystal clear which shows that the
court has wrongly ordered the issuance of summons u/o 37 CPC and
defendant was not at all at fault. He had put appearance and was waiting
for the summons of judgment and when the same were not issued he
appeared and took appropriate steps. Though the application u/o 9 Rule 7
CPC   has     been   dismissed   on   flimsy   ground   without   taking   into
consideration the relevant facts of the case. Ld. Trial Court in that order
had taken a view that after hearing of the case no application u/o 9 Rule 7
CPC can be allowed when the case was fixed for orders as no hearing
remained inter-se parties to the suit. It is correct preposition but only

RCA-06/11                                                           Page:-2/3
 when both parties are appearing but here in this case it was the fault of
the court itself and this fact should have been of paramount consideration
in the mind of the court while deciding the application as the defendant
had no knowledge that this was a simple suit.           He had acted upon
summons of appearance issued on prescribed format u/o 37 CPC. Though
it is correct that defendant should have taken the steps against the
dismissal of application u/o 9 Rule 7 CPC and he has been negligent       so
far but the court had to do substantial justice. It was also the duty of the
plaintiff to bring all the facts to the knowledge of the court at an earlier
stage and fraud or concealment with the court should not have been
done. Rules are made for imparting justice. It has been held in AIR 2000
SC 1165     United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Rajender Singh &amp;
Ors that "No court or tribunal can be regarded as powerless to
recall its own order if it is convinced that order was wangled
through fraud or misrepresentation of such dimension as would
affect the very basis of the claim." Herein the appellant is on a better
footing because it was apart from the concealment by plaintiff rather the
court itself was at fault, hence there should not have been any hesitation
on the part of the court to recall its order. The defendant was not at all
required to appear in this case unless the summons of judgment were
issued. Hence instant appeal is allowed with cost and             impugned
judgment and decree of Ld. Trial Court dated 11.1.11 is hereby set aside.
Matter is remanded back for trial to Ld. Trial Court.   Trial court record be
sent back alongwith copy of this judgment. Appeal file be consigned to
record room. Parties are directed to appear before Ld. Trial Court on
7.9.12.
