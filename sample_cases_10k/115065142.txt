              HIGH COURT OF CHHATTISGARH, BILASPUR
                  WRIT PETITION (S) NO. 7326 OF 2009

       Smt. D. Usha Rao, aged 59 years, W/o Shri D.S. Prakash Rao,
       Head Mistress, Govt. Middle School Bhainsbod, Block Dondi, Distt.
       Durg (CG).

       For Respondent-State     :      Shri Ashutosh Pandey, Panel Lawyer.

</p><p id="p_2">                    Hon'ble Shri Justice P. Sam Koshy
                              Order on Board
20.06.2018
</p><p id="p_3">  1.   The challenge in the present writ petition is to the order dated

       25.09.2009 (Annexure P/1) whereby the petitioner has been granted

       voluntary retirement w.e.f. 30.09.2009.
</p>
<p id="p_4">  2.   The counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner had moved

       an application for grant of voluntary retirement on 17.08.2009 as per

       Form-28 required under Rule 42 (1)(a) of the Chhattisgarh Civil

       Services (Pension) Rules, 1976 (in short, the Pension Rules). As per

       the said application, the petitioner had sought for voluntary

       retirement w.e.f. 01.12.2009, but the respondents have allowed the

       application and have retired her w.e.f. 30.09.2009 and in the process

       the petitioner has lost the salary and other benefits for the months of

       October and November, 2009 which otherwise she was entitled for if
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>
     the respondents would have acted as per her application for

     retirement. The petitioner for all practical purposes should have

     been granted retirement w.e.f. 01.12.2009 and not from 30.09.2009

     as she had given three months notice on 17.08.2009 which is the

     mandatory requirement as per the Pension Rules also.

</p><p id="p_5">3.   He further submits that the respondents have decided the date of

     retirement of 30.09.2009 without any basis whatsoever neither

     giving opportunity to the petitioner whether she intends to go on

     retirement w.e.f. 30.09.2009 or from 01.12.2009. The requirement

     under the Pension Rules is of giving three months clear notice for

     voluntary retirement which according to the petitioner she had

     moved on 17.08.2009 and three months time concludes on

     01.12.2009 from which date she has sought for retirement. However,

     abruptly the respondents have allowed her application and have

     sent the petitioner on retirement w.e.f. 30.09.2009. This according to

     the petitioner is bad in law as the petitioner has been deprived of the

     benefits of a regular employee which she was entitled for during the

     intervening period for the months of October and November, 2009.

     Thus, prayed that the order of retirement be modified to the extent of

     treating the petitioner to have been retired w.e.f. 01.12.2009 and she

     be paid salary and allowances for the month of October and

     November, 2009.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.   The State counsel referring to Annexure R/1 submits that the

     petitioner had infact on 24.09.2009 applied for voluntary retirement

     w.e.f. 01.08.2009. That the respondents have acted upon the said

     application and have retired her w.e.f. 30.09.2009. Therefore the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>
     petitioner cannot have any grievance. He further submits that the

     petitioner, in any case, intended retirement and the petitioner's claim

     has been allowed and therefore she should not have any grievance

     of having retired w.e.f. 30.09.2009.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.   Having heard the contentions put forth on either side and on perusal

     of records what is relevant to be taken note of is that Rule 42 of the

     Pension Rules clearly envisages that a government servant may

     retire at any time after completing 20 years qualifying service, by

     giving a notice in Form-28 to the appointing authority atleast three

     months before the date on which he/she wishes to retire. In the

     instant case if we see Annexure R/1 which is an admitted document

     by the petitioner as well it would reveal that it was moved on

     24.09.2009 in which she prayed for her voluntary retirement to be

     01.08.2009. However, the petitioner was not sent on retirement

     w.e.f. 01.08.2009 but her retirement was accepted from 30.09.2009

     i.e. after about two months from the date on which she had

     proposed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.   So far as application dated 17.08.2009 in prescribed Form is

     concerned, there does not appear to be any proof on the part of the

     petitioner of having submitted such a Form before the respondents

     at any point of time. The counsel for the petitioner also makes a

     statement that he had not withdrawn the earlier application dated

     24.04.2009 at any point of time. It is also not a case that the

     respondents had prior to 01.08.2009 acted upon the said letter or

     had ever refused to grant retirement to the petitioner w.e.f.

     01.08.2009 as per her claim dated 24.04.2009. Merely because the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                              4</span>
             petitioner has not submitted her application as per Form-28 as is

             required under the Pension Rules is of no consequence as she

             wanted retirement in any case. The petitioner wanted retirement

             w.e.f. 01.08.2009 as per her application dated 24.04.2009 and which

             has been acted upon by the respondents vide impugned order dated

             25.09.2009 retiring her w.e.f. 30.09.2009.
</p>
<p id="p_9">        7.   The another aspect which cannot be lost sight of is that the

             petitioner has not been sent on retirement before the date she has

             sought for vide application dated 24.04.2009, but has been sent on

             retirement only after the said date. As such, the petitioner has not

             been put to any loss. For want of sufficient proof as regards

             submission of her Form-28 on 17.08.2009, this court is not inclined

             to grant the petitioner relief of her being treated to be retired w.e.f.

             01.12.2009 instead of 30.09.2009. Thus, this court does not find any

             merit on the contention so raised by the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_10">        8.   The petition thus deserves to be and is accordingly dismissed.
