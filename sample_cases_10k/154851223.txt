 VINOD GOEL, J:

</pre><p id="p_1">1.     By these appeals, the appellants have challenged the impugned
judgment dated 20.03.2004 passed by the court of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Delhi, ('ASJ') in Session Case
No.100/2000 (1/2003) vide FIR No.371/2000, Police Station Vasant
Kunj, whereunder both of them were convicted under Section 302
read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_1">Section 34</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 ('<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>') and order
on sentence dated 29.03.2004, sentencing them to undergo life
imprisonment and pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- each and in default, to
undergo simple imprisonment for a period of two months.
</p><p id="p_2">2.      As per the case of the prosecution, the deceased, Ram Singh @
Lallan Yadav, the appellant, Tirath Singh Yadav (A-1) and Chaman
Yadav (A-2) were employed by Bhupinder Kumar Kalra (PW-1) at his
dairy farms No.37-38 and 23-22. The son of the deceased, namely,
Raju Yadav (PW-2) used to stay with his father at the dairy farm and
was prone to waste a lot of water from the tubewell. A-1 and A-2 used
to object to the deceased's son wasting the water. This caused an
altercation one day which led the accused persons threatening the
deceased that they would kill him if his son continued to cause such
wastage.
</p><p id="p_3">3.      As per the further case of the prosecution, on the intervening
night of 21/22.06.2000, the deceased was murdered by A-1 and A-2
which was witnessed by two employees of the said dairy farm, Moti
Lal (PW-16) and Sukhlal Yadav (PW-6). One Mr. Satish, driver of
the Tata Tempo 407 (PW-5), who came at the spot to load buffalos on


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl. A. Nos.273/2004 &amp; 279/2004                          Page 2 of 15</span>
 that night, found the deceased lying unconscious and informed the
owner Raju Kalra. The dairy owner and his brother came there and
informed the police pursuant to which a PCR van reached the spot.
The deceased was taken to Safdarjung Hospital where he was declared
'brought dead'. The post-mortem on the body of the deceased was
conducted on 23.06.2000. The post-mortem report states the cause of
death as 'shock, head injury and other associated injuries ante-
mortem in nature, caused by the application of blunt force from a
blunt object collectively sufficient to cause death in the ordinary
course of nature'.
</p><p id="p_4">4.      Both the accused persons were arrested on 23.06.2000. In their
separate disclosure statements, both of them disclosed that they had
murdered the deceased on the intervening night of 21/22.06.2000. A-
1 disclosed that A-2 had physically incapacitated the deceased while
sleeping and he himself had hit the deceased with the sabal due to
which he became unconscious. He disclosed that he had concealed the
sabal and could get the same recovered. He also disclosed that he
could get his associate arrested.   A-2 disclosed to the Investigating
Officer (IO) that he had physically incapacitated the deceased while he
was sleeping and A-1 had hit the deceased with a sabal made of iron
as a result of which the deceased became unconscious.          He also
disclosed that A-1 has concealed sabal and he could get his associate
(A-1) arrested. Both disclosure statements bear the signatures of two
witnesses, PW-1 and Ct. Shiv Lal (PW-15). The Arrest Memo of A-1
and A-2 are Ex. PW 17/D and Ex. PW 17/C respectively.                   The


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl. A. Nos.273/2004 &amp; 279/2004                          Page 3 of 15</span>
 Personal Search Memo of A-1 and A-2 are Ex. PW 15/E and Ex. PW
15/D respectively.
</p><p id="p_5">5.      On 23.06.2000, vide Pointing Out-cum-Seizure Memo of the
shirt (Ex. PW 1/D and Ex. PW 1/F), A-1 and A-2 got recovered their
respective blood stained shirts which they were wearing at the time of
commission of the crime, in the presence of PW-1 and PW-15. On the
same day, the A-1 got recovered the sabal in the presence of PW-1
and PW-15 vide Seizure Memo marked as Ex. PW 1/E.
</p><p id="p_6">6.      To bring home the guilt of the accused persons, the prosecution
examined 17 witnesses in all. The learned ASJ recorded the statements
of A-1 and A-2 separately under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_3">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 ('<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Cr.PC</a>') wherein they pleaded their innocence. Both
of them chose not to lead any evidence in their defence.
</p><p id="p_7">7.      We have heard the learned counsel for the appellants and the
learned APP for the State.
</p><p id="p_8">8.      PW-6 and PW-16, who were working in the dairy where crime
was committed, have turned hostile and did not support the case of the
prosecution. PW-6 testified that he knew the deceased as well as the
accused persons as they were working at the dairy of Raju Yadav and
he himself was working in dairy No.61-64. He further stated that on
16.06.2000, he went to his native place and returned on 27.06.2000.
On his return, he came to know that Ram Singh @ Lallan Yadav had
died. He stated that he does not know who had killed the deceased.
The testimony of PW-16 was recorded on 12.07.2002. He stated that
about two years before, he was working on the dairy of PW-2 at


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl. A. Nos.273/2004 &amp; 279/2004                            Page 4 of 15</span>
 Village Maksoodpur. He stated that he does not know Ram Singh @
Lallan Yadav @ Lambu Yadav (the deceased). He stated that he did
not see the incidence of murder as he was living at some other place.
Nothing could come out in their respective cross-examination
conducted by the learned APP that would have helped the case of the
prosecution. By impugned judgment, the learned ASJ having noticed
that both the eye-witnesses have turned hostile, convicted the
appellants on the basis of circumstantial evidence.
</p><p id="p_9">9.      <a href="/doc/1310327/" id="a_5">In Gagan Kanojia v. State of Punjab</a>; (2006) 13 SCC 516, the
Supreme Court summarized the following principles required to be
followed while basing a conviction on circumstantial evidence:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         "(1) There must be a chain of evidence so far complete
        as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion
        consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must
        be such as to show that within all human probability the
        act must have been done by the accused.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">        (2) Circumstantial evidence can be reasonably made the
        basis of an accused person's conviction if it is of such
        character that it is wholly inconsistent with the innocence
        of the accused and is consistent only with his guilt.
        (3) There should be no missing links but it is not that
        every one of the links must appear on the surface of the
        evidence, since some of these links may only be inferred
        from the proven facts.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">        (4) On the availability of two inferences, the one in
        favour of the accused must be accepted.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">        (5) It cannot be said that prosecution must meet any and
        every hypothesis put forward by the accused however
        far-fetched and fanciful it might be. Nor does it mean that
        prosecution evidence must be rejected on the slightest



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Crl. A. Nos.273/2004 &amp; 279/2004                             Page 5 of 15</span>
         doubt because the law permits rejection if the doubt is
        reasonable and not otherwise."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">10.     Since the learned APP in her arguments has referred to <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_6">Section
27</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 ('IEA'), it would be prudent to
refer to Sections 25, 26, and 27 of IEA, which read as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">        "25. Confession to police officer not to be proved.--
        No confession made to a police officer, shall be proved
        as against a person accused of any offence.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">        26. Confession by accused while in custody of police not
        to be proved against him.--
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">        No confession made by any person whilst he is in the
        custody of a police officer, unless it be made in the
        immediate presence of a Magistrate, shall be proved as
        against such person.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">        Explanation -- In this section "Magistrate" does not
        include the head of a village discharging magisterial
        functions in the Presidency of Fort St. George or
        elsewhere, unless such headman is a Magistrate
        exercising the powers of a Magistrate under the Code of
        Criminal Procedure, 1882.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">        27. How much of information received from accused
        may be proved.--
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">        Provided that, when any fact is deposed to as discovered
        in consequence of information received from a person
        accused of any offence, in the custody of a police officer,
        so much of such information, whether it amounts to a
        confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact thereby
        discovered, may be proved."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">11.     While reiterating the principles embodied in Sections 25 and 26
of IEA, in <a href="/doc/70941143/" id="a_7">Indra Dalal v. State of Haryana</a>; (2015) 11 SCC 31, the
Supreme Court held as under :-
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Crl. A. Nos.273/2004 &amp; 279/2004                              Page 6 of 15</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">         "16. The philosophy behind the aforesaid provision is
        acceptance of a harsh reality that confessions are
        extorted by the police officers by practising oppression
        and torture or even inducement and, therefore, they are
        unworthy of any credence. The provision absolutely
        excludes from evidence against the accused a
        confession made by him to a police officer. This
        provision applies even to those confessions which are
        made to a police officer who may not otherwise be
        acting as such. If he is a police officer and confession
        was made in his presence, in whatever capacity, the same
        becomes inadmissible in evidence. This is the substantive
        rule of law enshrined under this provision and this strict
        rule has been reiterated countlessly by this Court as well
        as the High Courts.                   (emphasis added)

</blockquote><p id="p_12">12.     The scope of Section 27 of the IEA was elaborated by the
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1662945/" id="a_8">Anter Singh v. State of Rajasthan</a>; (2004) 10 SCC
657 which reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">        "14. The expression "provided that" together with the
        phrase "whether it amounts to a confession or not"
        shows that the section is in the nature of an exception to
        the preceding provisions particularly Sections 25 and 26.
        It is not necessary in this case to consider if this section
        qualifies, to any extent, Section 24, also. It will be seen
        that the first condition necessary for bringing this
        section into operation is the discovery of a fact, albeit a
        relevant fact, in consequence of the information
        received from a person accused of an offence. The
        second is that the discovery of such fact must be
        deposed to. The third is that at the time of the receipt of
        the information the accused must be in police custody.
        The last but the most important condition is that only
        "so much of the information" as relates distinctly to the
        fact thereby discovered is admissible. The rest of the
        information has to be excluded. The word "distinctly"
</blockquote>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">Crl. A. Nos.273/2004 &amp; 279/2004                              Page 7 of 15</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">         means       "directly",     "indubitably",       "strictly",
        "unmistakably". The word has been advisedly used to
        limit and define the scope of the provable information.
        The phrase "distinctly" relates "to the fact thereby
        discovered" and is the linchpin of the provision. This
        phrase refers to that part of the information supplied by
        the accused which is the direct and immediate cause of
        the discovery. The reason behind this partial lifting of the
        ban against confessions and statements made to the
        police, is that if a fact is actually discovered in
        consequence of information given by the accused, it
        affords some guarantee of truth of that part, and that part
        only, of the information which was the clear, immediate
        and proximate cause of the discovery. No such guarantee
        or assurance attaches to the rest of the statement which
        may be indirectly or remotely related to the fact
        discovered.     (<a href="/doc/1329788/" id="a_9">See Mohd.      Inayatullah v. State      of
        Maharashtra</a> (1976) 1 SCC 828)." (emphasis added)

</blockquote><p id="p_13">13.     In view of the provisions of Sections 25 and 26 of the IEA and
the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Indra Dalal's case
(supra), confession of the guilt made by the accused in their disclosure
statements while in police custody being inadmissible in evidence,
cannot be used against them. However, Section 27 of the IEA is an
exception to Sections 25 and 26 of the IEA. It provides that any fact
discovered in consequence of the information received from a person
accused of any offence while in the custody of a police officer as
relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered, is admissible.
</p><p id="p_14">14.     In the instant case, PW-1, who is the owner of the dairy, has
been examined by the prosecution to prove the arrest of the accused
persons, their disclosure and recovery of the articles. He reached the
spot pursuant to the information given by PW-5, a tempo driver. He

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">Crl. A. Nos.273/2004 &amp; 279/2004                              Page 8 of 15</span>
 found his employee Ram Singh in an injured condition lying on a cot
in front of dairy No.23. He called the police by dialing No.100. The
PCR van removed the deceased to Safdarjung Hospital. The police
recorded the statement of PW-1 (Ex. PW 1/A).
</p><p id="p_15">15.     The prosecution examined PW-1 who testified as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">         '...............On the next day i.e. on 23.6.2000 both the
         accused persons were arrested by the police. Accused
         Chamman Singh was arrested from near bus stand
         near village Maksood Pur while accused Tirath Singh
         was arrested from railway station New Delhi in the
         evening. Both the accused were interrogated by the
         police in my presence and both the accused admitted
         that they both had killed Ram Singh @ Lallan and they
         also disclosed separately that they had kept the sabal
         the weapon of offence in the store of the dairy and they
         also disclosed that they had concealed their blood
         stained clothes in the same store and they can get the
         same recovered. The disclosure statement of accused
         Tirath Singh is Ex. PW 1/B and bears my signatures at
         point A and the disclosure statement of accused
         Chaman Singh is Ex. PW 1/C and bears my signatures
         at point A. Both the accused persons then led us to the
         store of the dairy No.22 and pointed out towards the

<p id="p_16">16.     The Arrest Memo of A-1, Ex. PW 17/D is dated 23.06.2000. It
is important to note that it does not mention the place and time of his
arrest and indicates :-

<p id="p_17">17.     Similarly, the Arrest Memo of A-2, Ex. PW 17/C dated
23.06.2000, does not indicate the specific dairy from which he was
arrested. Time of his arrest is also not mentioned. It indicates :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">                    "5. Place of Arrest: Dairy Masoodpur

<p id="p_18">18.     PW-1 claimed that A-1 and A-2 were arrested in his presence
but surprisingly, the Arrest Memo of A-1 and A-2, Ex. PW 17/D and
Ex. PW 17/C respectively, do not bear his signatures. The IO (PW-
</p><p id="p_19">17) has also not explained as to why his signatures were not obtained.
Both these arrest memos bear the name of only one witness, that is,
PW-15 and again surprisingly, only the Arrest Memo of A-1 bears his
signatures. The arrest memo of A-2 does not bear signatures of the
sole witness though his name is mentioned on the document. The


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">Crl. A. Nos.273/2004 &amp; 279/2004                             Page 10 of 15</span>
 personal search memo of A-1 (Ex. PW 15/E) dated 23.06.2000 though
bears the name of PW-15, does not bear his signatures. The personal
search memo of A-2 (Ex. PW 15/D) bears the signatures of the only
witness, that is, PW-15. A-1 and A-2 were arrested in the presence of
PW-1, but it is also not explained as to why his signatures were not
obtained by the IO on the personal search memos of A-1 and A-2.
Non-mentioning of the place and time of arrest of A-1 and A-2 and
non-obtaining of the signatures of PW-1 on the arrest memo and
personal search memo certainly creates a doubt on the veracity of the
case of the prosecution.
</p><p id="p_20">19.     PW-1 has testified that both the accused persons have disclosed
that after committing the crime, they had concealed their blood stained
clothes in the fodder store and could get the same recovered.
However, the disclosure statements of A-1 and A-2, Ex. PW 1/B and
Ex. PW 1/C respectively, nowhere so indicate. The seizure memo of
the shirts of the A-1 (Ex. PW 1/D) and A-2 (Ex. PW 1/F) mention that
blood stained shirts were got recovered by A-1 and A-2 on the basis of
their disclosure statements, Ex. PW 1/B and Ex. PW 1/C which, in
fact, is not reflected in the disclosure statements. As per the disclosure
statement of A-2 (Ex. PW 1/C), he had only disclosed that the sabal
was concealed by A-1 and he could get A-1 arrested. He never
volunteered to get anything recovered. Only A-1 disclosed in his
disclosure statement, Ex. PW 1/B that he could get the sabal
recovered. However, PW-1 testified that „the sabal is Ex. P1 which
was got recovered by the accused persons'. The weapon of offence,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">Crl. A. Nos.273/2004 &amp; 279/2004                             Page 11 of 15</span>
 that is, sabal was not found to bear any blood at the time of recovery.
Further, PW-7, Dr. Chander Kant, who conducted the post-mortem on
the body of the deceased had opined in his cross-examination that the
ante-mortem injuries from 1 to 8 could not be caused by the sabal of
iron. He stated that „At this stage, a sealed parcel having the seal of
the court is opened and it is found to contain a sable of iron. In my
opinion, the antemortem injuries from 1 to 8 could not be produced by
this weapon.        The antemortem injuries No.1 to 6 are caused by
application of blunt force from fists and 7 and 8 are likely to be
caused by use of iron rod or a lathi.‟
</p><p id="p_21">20.     As per the FSL report, Ex. PX, PY and PZ, the blood group
'AB' was detected on one of the shirts only, that is, S-6 and not on S-
</p><p id="p_22">5. The report indicate 'AB' blood group of the deceased which was
found on S4a (Baniyan), S4b (Lungi) and S4c (Shawl) which were
seized vide Memo, Ex. PW 15/A from the Charpai (Cot) on which the
deceased was lying. But there is no evidence whether the shirt S-6
belongs to A-1 or A-2.
</p><p id="p_23">21.     Following the ratio of the judgment of the Supreme Court in
Gagan Kanojia's case (supra), it can be said that in a case based
solely on circumstantial evidence, the chain of circumstances has to be
unabridged so as to be compatible with only one conclusion, that is,
the guilt of the accused and if any missing link in the chain of
circumstances gives rise to two inferences, then the inference
favouring the accused must be accepted.
</p><p id="p_24">22. In the instant case, there are several missing links in the chain of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">Crl. A. Nos.273/2004 &amp; 279/2004                           Page 12 of 15</span>
 circumstances which went unnoticed by the learned ASJ while
convicting the appellants. The recovery of the weapon of offence, that
is, sabal does not support the case of the prosecution in view of the
testimony of PW-7, Dr.Chander Kant, who testified that the ante-
mortem injuries could not have been inflicted by the sabal. Moreover,
the weapon of offence, that is, sabal was not having blood stains at the
time of its recovery. The recovery of sabal has been made pursuant to
the disclosure statement by A-1, whereas PW-1 testified that it was
recovered at the instance of both, A-1 and A-2.
</p><p id="p_25">23.     Both the accused persons in their respective disclosure
statements never disclosed that they could get their respective shirts
recovered and the shirts recovered vide recovery memo, Ex. PW 1/D
and PW 1/F, purportedly on the basis of the disclosure statements,
appear to have been planted. Only one shirt, S-6, was found bearing
blood group 'AB' but it is not proved whether the said shirt belongs to
A-1 or A-2. The time and place of arrest of both the accused are also
not reflected in their respective arrest memos. The arrest and personal
search memos of both the accused persons do not bear the signatures
of PW-1, who claims to have been present at the time of their arrest.
Though the personal search memo of A-1 and arrest memo of A-2,
mention the name of the witness, PW-15, but he has not signed either
of these documents.
</p><p id="p_26">24.     In view of the aforesaid glaring gaps in the case of the
prosecution, we are of the opinion that the prosecution has failed to
prove the guilt of the appellants beyond any reasonable doubt.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">Crl. A. Nos.273/2004 &amp; 279/2004                           Page 13 of 15</span>
<p id="p_27"> 25.     Given the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, both
the appellants are entitled to benefit of doubt. Both the appeals are
accordingly allowed and the impugned judgment dated 20.03.2004
and the order on sentence dated 29.03.2004 are hereby set aside.
Consequently, both the appellants are acquitted of the offences under
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_10">Section 302</a> read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_11">Section 34</a> IPC. The bail bonds and surety
bonds furnished by the appellants stand discharged. The appellants
shall comply with the requirements of <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_12">Section 437A</a> Cr.PC to the
satisfaction of the trial court at the earliest. The Trial Court Record be
returned together with a certified copy of the judgment. Copy of this
judgment be sent to the concerned Jail Superintendent for updating the
jail record.
</p><p id="p_28">26.     The court further finds that the trial Court has not awarded any
compensation to the legal representatives of the deceased under
<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_13">Section 357</a> of Cr.P.C. Meanwhile Section 357A <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_14">Cr.P.C</a>. has been
incorporated w.e.f. 31.12.2009 and pursuant thereto, the Government
of NCT of Delhi has framed the Victim Compensation Scheme.
Therefore, we direct the Delhi State Legal Services Authority
('DSLSA') in terms of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_15">Section 357A</a> (5) <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_16">Cr.PC</a>, to forthwith undertake
an inquiry and within two months award and ensure disbursal of
appropriate compensation to the family of the victim in terms thereof.
For this purpose, a certified copy of this judgment shall be delivered
forthwith to the Secretary, DSLSA with a further direction to submit a
compliance report to this Court within three months from the date of
receipt of the certified copy of this judgment. If no such compliance is
