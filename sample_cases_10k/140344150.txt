<p id="p_1">06.      26.03.2010               This application is against the order dated

                         01.06.2006 of the learned S.D.J.M., Purnea in C.A.

                         No. 2273 of 2005, whereby cognizance of the

                         offence under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_1">Section 498A</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_2">323</a> of the I.P.C. as well

                         as <a href="/doc/1023340/" id="a_3">Section 4</a> of the Dowry Prohibition Act has been

                         taken against the petitioner and others.

</p><p id="p_2">                                  Initially the complainant Rani Kumari had

                         filed complaint against the petitioner and five others

                         alleging offence under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_4">Sections 406</a>, <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_5">498A</a>, <a href="/doc/140515/" id="a_6">313</a>,

                         <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_7">120B</a> of the I.P.C. and Section Â¾ of <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_8">Dowry

                         Prohibition Act</a>. On filing of the complaint learned

                         Magistrate conducted the inquiry and witnesses were

                         examined but the learned Magistrate took cognizance

                         of the offence against only two accused and

                         cognizance was not taken against four others

                         including the petitioner. The complainant preferred
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                    2</span>




Cr.Revision No.214 of 2006 before the Sessions

Judge, Purnea, which was decided by order dated

31.08.2006 and the order dated 08.12.2006 of the

learned S.D.J.M., Purnea was set aside, finding

material against accused Nos. 2 to 5 and the matter

was remitted back again to the learned S.D.J.M.,

Purnea for further inquiry and passing necessary

orders.
</p>
<p id="p_3">          It was after the passing of the aforesaid

revisional order the learned S.D.J.M. has taken

cognizance of the offence against all the accused

persons including the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_4">    Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that

the revisional order of the learned Sessions Judge

does not discuss any material against the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_5">          Learned Addl. P.P. replied that the learned

Sessions Judge did not direct for taking cognizance

against any particular accused but on the materials as

found in the order, the order of the learned

Magistrate whereby he did not take cognizance

against the accused was set aside and the matter was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                   3</span>




remitted back for further inquiry and passing orders

according to law. It is submitted that on perusal of

the materials further the S.D.J.M. had taken

cognizance against the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        Learned counsel for the petitioner submits

that there is no material against the petitioner and

that neither the complainant nor any witness has

leveled any allegation on the petitioner.    In this

context paragraph Nos. 8,9 &amp; 10 of the complaint

petition is referred to by the learned Addl.P.P. and

also the learned counsel for the informant.       In

paragraph Nos. 9 &amp; 10, there is specific allegation

that when the father of the complainant went to the

petitioner for re-conciliation of the matter the

petitioner insulted him and he also asked for payment

of the demanded dowry and he threatened that if the

money is not paid the life of the complainant will be

spoiled. Thus, considering the specific allegation, I

find that the learned S.D.J.M. is justified in taking

cognizance of the offence against the petitioner.

There is no need to make any interference in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                        4</span>




       impugned order. Accordingly, the application is

       dismissed.
