23/01/2015

      Shri F.A. Shah, Advocate, for applicants- Babloo and
Riyaz Quraishi.
      Shri   Pramod    Pachouri,   Public   Prosecutor,    for   the
respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard.
</p><p id="p_2">      Perused the case diary.
</p><p id="p_3">      This is the first application under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> of Cr.P.C.
preferred on behalf of the applicants for grant of bail.
</p><p id="p_4">      The applicants have been arrested on 28.11.2014 in
connection with Crime No.712/2014, registered at Police
Station Kampoo, District Gwalior (M.P.) for the offence
punishable <a href="/doc/594493/" id="a_2">Sections 294</a>, <a href="/doc/1440821/" id="a_3">332</a>, <a href="/doc/1208971/" id="a_4">353</a>, <a href="/doc/222396/" id="a_5">427</a>, <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_6">147</a>, <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_7">149</a>, <a href="/doc/886598/" id="a_8">365</a> of IPC,
11/13 of the MPDVPK Act and under Sections 10,13 of the M.P.
Sthaniya Paridhi Nirwachan Adhiniyam.
</p><p id="p_5">      Briefly stated the prosecution case is that on 28.11.2014
at about 05:30 PM at Rajveer Higher Secondary School, Gudi-
Guda Ka Naka, polling was conducted. Vishwanath Bansal was
the In-charge Polling Officer at ward No. 55 of polling booth
No. 746. He heard some noises outside and went out along with
his staff to see what has happened. He saw that congress
candidate of that ward in the local election, co-accused
Tabassum Begum along with about 150-200 members came
armed with wooden sticks, they were hitting the doors and
shutter. These people on opening the door entered into the
                              2                   Mcrc.127.2015

<p id="p_6">room and dragged him and beaten him by fists and kicks. They
also destroyed the voting machine and the furniture kept inside
the room. The complainant was taken out of the room, when he
managed to come into the room, he found that another staff
member Archana Bhargava was not in the room. The chowkidar
of the School informed that the mob, who had come, have taken
Archana in a four wheeler vehicle. In the Police Diary,
statement of Archana is available. It is found that she was
taken to a nearby temple for speaking the truth under oath that
they have not manipulated the voting machine. Later she was
taken to the Nagarpalika Office and was dropped.
</p><p id="p_7">     On behalf of the applicants, it is submitted that the
applicants are innocent. They are not named in the FIR. The
present applicants have been implicated on the basis of
memorandum under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_9">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act given by
co-accused Abdul Khaliq. Learned counsel for the applicants
further submitted that the offence under Sections 10, 13 of the
M.P. Sthaniya Paridhi Nirwachan Adhiniyam is bailable. Smt.
Archana who was said to have been abducted was taken to the
temple and from there she was taken to the Municipal Office
where she was released. Thus, there was no intention of
kidnapping or abduction or any purpose like ransom or
confinement, therefore, offence under <a href="/doc/886598/" id="a_10">Section 365</a> of IPC is
also not made out against the applicants. Hence, on these
premised submissions, learned counsel for the applicants
submits that the applicants may be enlarged on bail.

</p>

<p id="p_9">       Learned Public Prosecutor opposed the bail application
and submitted that applicants alongwith co-accused Irfan had
assembled at the polling booth and committed crime. It is also
suggested that because of the crime public property was
damaged and the election was re-conducted. Thus, he prayed
for rejection of the bail application.
</p><p id="p_10">       Applicants are in custody since 28.11.2014. They are not
named in the FIR. Considering the same coupled with the fact
that action of the applicants is not reflected except omnibus
allegations, without commenting on the merits, application is
allowed. It is directed that the applicants shall be released on
bail   on   their   furnishing    personal   bond   in   a   sum    of
Rs.1,00,000/- (Rs. One Lac only) each with one solvent
surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial
Court for securing their presence before the said Court on all
the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial.

the following conditions by the applicants:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       1.    The applicants will comply with all the terms and
       conditions of the bond executed by them;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       3.    The applicants will not indulge themselves in
       extending inducement, threat or promise to any person
       acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade
       him/her from disclosing such facts to the Court or to the
                              4                   Mcrc.127.2015
