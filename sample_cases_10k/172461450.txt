Present:    Mr. Rahul Rampal, Advocate
            for the petitioner.

            Mr. Harsimar Singh Sitta, AAG, Punjab
            assisted by ASI-Rawinder.

<p id="p_1">            Petitioner Sandeep Singh has filed this petition seeking regular

bail in case FIR No. 35 dated 03.03.2018 (Annexure P-1), under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_1">Sections

406</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_2">420</a> of the Indian Penal Code, Police Station Mukerian, District

Hoshiarpur filed by the complainant-Mohan Lal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            As per the FIR it was alleged that a sum of `12,50,000/-

(rupees twelve lakh fifty thousand only) was paid to the accused (petitioner)

to facilitate a job for son of the complainant in Punjab Police. The amount

was paid on three different occasions i.e., spread between 20.08.2016 to

30.10.2016. It was alleged that neither the amount was refunded nor the job

was provided and therefore the accused has committed the offence of

cheating and criminal breach of trust.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the offences

punishable under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_3">Section 406</a> and <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_4">420</a> are anti-thesis of each others the

ingredients to constitute the offence are entirely different. According to him

the alleged occurrence is of 2016 whereas the FIR was got recorded on

03.03.2018 i.e., after a period of 01 year and 06 months. It is also pointed

out that the investigation of the case is complete and challan stands filed on

03.04.2019 and the petitioner is in custody since 03.03.2018. The case is

triable by the Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             On the other hand learned counsel for the respondent-

complainant No.2 has vehemently opposed the bail application on the

ground that the petitioner has offered a sum of ` 5,00,000/- (five lakhs only)

to settle the dispute however he has retracted from that. However, it is not

disputed by the learned State counsel that the investigation is complete and

the challan stands filed.    Reliance is also placed upon the order dated

23.08.2018 whereby the concession of interim anticipatory bail granted

came to an end with the dismissal of the application bearing CRM-M-

20120-2018 .
</p>
<p id="p_5">             At this stage learned counsel for the petitioner contends that he

had approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court for the same relief however the

same was dismissed and later on the petitioner was arrested in the case.

Considering the above background and the fact that the case is triable by the

Magistrate and the same is likely to take some time, no useful purpose

would be served by keeping the petitioner behind the bars.

</p><p id="p_6">             Resultantly without commenting anything on the merits of the

case, petitioner is ordered to be released on bail, on his furnishing bail
