                                      Versus
The State of Haryana and others                              ...Respondents

CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE G.S. SANDHAWALIA

Present:      Mr. Bhupander Ghanghas, Advocate
              for the petitioner.

              *****

G.S. SANDHAWALIA, J. (ORAL)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">              The present writ petition has been filed under Articles

226/227 of the Constitution of India against the concurrent findings of

the authorities below from Collector to the Financial Commissioner

challenging the order of appointment of private respondent No.6 Rajesh

Kumar as Lambardar of village Khera.
</p>
<p id="p_2">              Counsel for the petitioner vehemently submitted that the

SDO, Siwani as such recommended his name vide communication dated

21.03.2011 (Annexure P-6) while directing the parties to appear before

the Collector and therefore, he submits that the authorities below were in

error in not appointing the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_3">              A perusal of the paper-book would go on to show that

keeping in view the comparative merits of the 3 candidates including one

Mange Ram, the District Collector had passed the order on 05.09.2011

(Annexure P-8) which was upheld on 18.11.2011 (Annexure P-9) and

16.07.2015 (Annexure P-10) by the Commissioner, Hisar and the

Financial Commissioner, Haryana, respectively. The common thread


                                 1 of 2
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">              ::: Downloaded on - 08-10-2018 08:38:57 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> CWP No.21091 of 2018                                                    2</span>

which runs through the three orders is that the petitioner lost out in the

race in view of the fact that the private respondent was younger in age

being 27 years old and petitioner being 40 years old. He was also more

qualified as he was MA degree holder whereas the petitioner is only 10th

pass.   Similarly, the land holding was also 3 times more than the

petitioner, who only has 3 acres of land and the private respondent has 49

kanals and 17 marlas (6 acres of land). In such circumstances, the private

respondent is better placed in life.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             The settled principle is that the Collector is the best judge in

case of the appointment of the Headman under the Punjab Land Revenue

Rules. It is not for this Court to go into the comparative merits of the

candidates specially when the orders of the Collector and the other

authorities, do not suffer from any perversity. In such circumstances, no

case is made out for interference in the said orders.

</p><p id="p_5">             Resultantly, in view of the above discussion, the present writ

petition is dismissed in limine.</p><pre id="pre_2">
