Ishwar Lal for the surrender of the permit in duplicate and sworn 

affidavit of Ishwar Lal. All the documents were of 05/07/1994. 

The said documents were handed over by Shri V.K. Gupta to 

Shri Ram Pal Singh, an Ex­employee of DTC, who often used to 

visit   STA   office   to   help   the   officials   in   writing   work.   The 

surrender application was found to be not fulfilled in properly. 

On the instructions of Shri V.K. Gupta, Shri Ram Pal had filled 

the missing details. Shri Ram Pal then put up the note dated 

05.07.1994   alongwith   the   said   forged   documents.   Shri   V.K. 

Gupta first signed the said note sheet but later on after he found 

that the surrender application of the applicant did not match the 

original   application   submitted   by   Shri   Ishwar   Lal   for   grant   of 

permit, he crossed the said note but kept the forged documents 

on record.

PROSECUTION EVIDENCE



</p><p id="p_21">11.   The prosecution has examined 21 witnesses. 



</p><p id="p_22">12.   Witness PW1 Shri VA Vasu is the Technical Officer from 

State Transport Authority. He had deposed two things. First, that 


C.C. No. 13/11
 for   the   transfer   of   ownership   of   a   commercial   vehicle,   it   is 

mandatory   to   submit   the   slip   with   regard   to   the   surrender   of 

permit, which is issued by the STA. Second, when he took over 

as the MLO of the Authority, the file of the vehicle DL1P­5290 

was not traceable.
</p>
<p id="p_23">

</p><p id="p_24">13.    Witness   PW2   Shri   Virender   Singh   Secretary   OBC 

Commission Govt of India had proved the order of Sanction Ex 

PW   2/A   stating,   inter­alia,   that   he   was   working   as   Secretary 

Commissioner,   Govt   of   NCT.   in   December     1999   and   was 

competent to remove the accused from service.



</p><p id="p_25">14.    Witness   PW­3   Inspector   Sudhir   Jain   had   deposed   that 

from  April,   1993  to   July,   1994   he   was  posted   as  MLO  Head 

(Quarter)   as   Driving   Test   Inspector.     He   had   signed   the 

registration certificate of bus No. DL­1P 5290  Ex. PW­3/A in the 

name of Smt. Laxmi Devi.   He had further stated that the file 

relating   to   the   transfer   of   vehicle   was   brought   to   him   by   the 

accused who was working in his office as UDC. He had signed 


C.C. No. 13/11
 the said registration certificate on the assurance of the accused 

that he will provide surrender slip and the bus permit   on the 

same day. 
</p>
<p id="p_26">

</p><p id="p_27">15.    He had further identified the signatures of Shri J.S. Dabas, 

MLO on the R.C. of the same vehicle Ex. PW­3/B showing  the 

bus being transferred in the name of Shri R.S. Bhardwaj. 



</p><p id="p_28">16.    Witness   PW­4   Shi   R.S.   Chiller   deposed   that   he   was 

working as Head Clerk at the office of MLO (HQ), Under Hill 

Road, Rajpur Road, Delhi.   He alongwith Record Keepers Shri 

Virender and Shri Chandra had tried to trace the file of bus No. 

DL­1P   5290   containing   the   registration   certificate   but   despite 

their best efforts the same could not be find.     He had further 

deposed   that   this   file   was   not   kept   in   safe   custody.   He   had 

clarified that it is only those files in which there is an order to 

preserve the file by the Court or there is any order received from 

any agency like police or CBI etc. to preserve the file, are kept in 

safe custody and remaining files are kept in open racks.  


C.C. No. 13/11
</p><p id="p_29"> 17.   PW­5 Shri Ishwar Lal is the victim in this case. He had 

deposed that he was discharged from Indian Army in the year 

1979 as Hawaldar Clerk.  He had submitted the application Ex. 

PW­5/A dated 25.01.1992 for a permit to be granted of a red line 

bus.  In a draw of lots for the allotment of granting of permit he 

was declared successful.  A letter of intent dated 24.12.1992 Ex. 

PW­5/B was issued to him. Pursuant to that he had purchased a 

new bus from M/s Ashok Leyland bearing No. DL­1P 5290 for 

which   he   had   taken   a   loan   of   Rs.   3   lacs   from   M/s   Ashok 

Leyland.  He had submitted all the required papers for granting 

the permit and his bus was also passed by the office of STA, 

Burari. He was informed that he has been alloted route No. 706 

from Vivek Vihar to Pragati Maidan. Though he submitted all the 

documents   for   the   issuance   of   the     permit   along   with   the 

requisite   fee   but   no   permit   was   issued   to   him.     He   wrote 

reminders   dated   04.03.1994,   07.03.1994   and   28.10.1994   Ex. 

PW­5/C to Ex. PW­5/F, also submitted affidavit Ex. PW­5/G and 

a receipt of payment of the permit security fee Ex. PW­5/H (On 


C.C. No. 13/11
 the same receipt later on he was refunded the security deposit / 

earnest money). 
</p>
<p id="p_30">

</p><p id="p_31">18.   His   testimony   further   reveals   that   because   of   non­

issuance   of   permit,   he   could   not   ply   the   bus   resulting   in 

accumulation of installments.  The forged applications submitted 

in duplicate Ex. PW­5/I­1 and Ex. PW­5/I­2 and also the affidavit 

Ex.   PW­5/J   were   shown   to   the   witness   for   identifying   his 

signatures on the said documents.  He had categorically denied 

having submitted the said applications and the affidavit.  He had 

also denied that these said documents had   his signatures. In 

fact he had stated that he had never submitted any application 

for surrender of permit and he actually on the other hand, had 

been trying his level best to get the permit. 



</p><p id="p_32">19.   There   was   one   permit   on   record   Ex.   PW­5/K   dated 

15.12.1993, which is supposed to be a forged permit showing 

the route different from for which the actual permit was granted, 

was shown to the witness during the testimony.   The witness 


C.C. No. 13/11
 had denied having submitted the same. He had further added 

that the route stated therein was not assigned to him. 



</p><p id="p_33">20.    He has also shown copy of another permit Ex. PW­5/L for 

identification­   which   was  supposed  to  be  the   actual  permit  to 

have   been   issued   to   the   witness.       He   had   denied   that   this 

permit was ever issued to  him.

      out   what   are   the   ingredients   of   the   offence   of 
      cheating.  Firstly,   there   has   to   be   practice   of 
      deception by the offender. Then on account of the 
      deception   there   must   be   fraudulent   or   dishonest 
      inducement so as to make the person deceived to 
      deliver any property or to do  something or omit to 
      do something  etc. Lastly,  by reason of delivery of 
      the property or the doing of a thing or  the omission 
      to do a thing, there must be the causing of or the 
      likelihood of the causing of damage or harm to the 


C.C. No. 13/11
       person   deceived   in   body,   mind,   reputation   or 
      property.  Thus,   as   a   result   of   the   dishonest 
      inducement   of   a   person,   there   can   be   either 
      wrongful   loss   to   the   person   deceived   or 
      wrongful gain to another including the person 
      practising the deception. Whenever any one of 
      these   results   follow   on   account   of   the 
      deception   practised   by   a   person,   then   the 
      offence   of   cheating   would   be   complete.  The 
      learned   Magistrate   is   not,     therefore,   correct   in 
      having   taken   the   view   that   since   no   damage   or 
      harm   had   been   caused   to   the   person   to   wit   the

but becomes a thing of value, in the hand of the person, who

Although in this note there is an allegation tried to be made that 

Shri Ishwar Lal was trying to get a route allotted on the basis of 

a  forged   permit     but   for   us  what   is   important   is   that   there   is 



C.C. No. 13/11
 categorical assertion that permit allotted to him was still lying in 

the file and not received by Shri Ishwar Lal. In support there is 

testimony   of   the   Shri   Ishwar   Lal   himself   and   the   various 

application he wrote to STA making a request that the permit be 

issued to him and in fact it is the non­issuance of the permit 

which became the reason the vehicle being re­possessed by the 

Finance company for having not been able to make the payment 

of installments because he could not have plied the bus in the 

absence of the permit. Sufficient would it be if relevant portion of 
                          th
his last letter dated 28  October 1994 Ex PW5/F is reproduced. 

[There is an allegation in this letter that there was conspiracy  

from the beginning that he may not be able to get the permit,  

resulting in the failure of business consequently re­possession  

of the vehicle and someone ending up picking his brand new  

Bus.   It   could   be   true   because   once   the   vehicle   was   re­

possessed it did not take long for the mother of the Accused  

buying the Bus. Since there had been no investigation from this  

angle   I   am   overlooking   these   allegation   and   the   portion  

reproduced may only be considered that there was no permit

the vehicle was to be transferred in the name of  his mother it is 

impossible to believe that he would have not  known that there 

was no permit issued to Ishwar Lal at any point of time. 



</p><p id="p_146">70.   The relevant parts of the testimonies of Witness PW­3 Shri 

Sudhir Jain MLO had PW15 Shri C L Meena have already been 

reproduced above to show that they had been approached by 

the   Accused   and   persuaded   by   the   Accused   to   transfer   the 

vehicles in the name of his mother and to the name of Shri R S 

Bhardwaj without the surrender slip on the assurance that he 

would produce the same later. I have closely seen the cross­

examination   of   these   witnesses   and   there   is   also   nothing   of 

importance pointed by the Ld defence counsel which may create 

any   doubt   about   there   testimony.   It   is   apparent   that   this 



C.C. No. 13/11
 persuasion of transferring of vehicle without   the surrender slip 

of permit on the pretext of producing it later, was nothing but a 

gambit to have the vehicle transferred without the surrender slip 

as there could not have been surrender slip of permit because it 

had never reached the hands of the permit holder Sh Ishwar Lal. 

In other words it was nothing but dishonest inducement by the 

Accused of Shri Sudhir Jain MLO and Clerk Shri C L Meena 

which resulted in the transfer of the vehicle in the name of the 

mother   of   the   accused   first,   Smt.   Laxmi   Devi   and   then   from 

Laxmi Devi to Sh. R S Bhardwaj.

There is little doubt that had it not been for the assurance given 

by   the   Accused   as   to   the   supply   of   the   surrender   slip     the 

vehicles could not have been transferred in the name of Smt

what harm has been caused to   Shri Sudhir Jain and Shri C L

Murari Chakraborty' s case ( supra) the wrongful not necessarily 

is to be in terms of money. It is sufficient to attract offence of

1993 as he used to come to the office of Shri D.S. Chaudhary, 

MLO at that time.   Since he had a permit in his name but was 

not in a position to purchase the bus he had introduced him to 

the   accused.     He   had   stated   during   the   examination   in   his 

testimony "I introduced him with Shri Prakash Chand.  The bus 

was   purchased   in   the   name   of   Smt.   Laxmi   Devi   mother   of 

Prakash Chand. I do not know what happened thereafter".  This 

is a fact which was admitted by the accused in his statement 

under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_60">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. and there was also no question put 

to him in the cross­examination. 
</p>
<p id="p_185">

</p><p id="p_186">83.   To sum up, it is evident that there is sufficient material on 

record that the vehicle was transferred from Smt. Laxmi Devi to 

Shri R.S. Bhardwaj and the accused was instrumental in getting 


C.C. No. 13/11
 the   vehicle   transferred   in   the   name   of   Shri   R.S.   Bhardwaj 

without   the surrender slip of the permit. Ld. Defence counsel 

had examined  the witness DW­1 Shri Satish  Kumar who had 

placed   on   record   a   computerized   print   out   showing   that   the 

vehicle last stood in the name of Shri R.S. Bhardwaj. 



Other persons involved in the transfer not made accused in 
this case.
</p>
<p id="p_187">


</p><p id="p_188">84.   It has been submitted by the learned defence counsel that 

the accused was merely a LDC and was not concerned with the 

transfer of the vehicle.  The persons who were actually involved 

in transfer of vehicle have not been made accused in this case. 

I  am  of   the  view  that  this  submission  of  the  learned  defence 

counsel   is   of   little   consequence.     The   witnesses   who   were 

actually involved in the transfer of the vehicle, namely, Shri C.L. 

Meena   and   Shri   Sudhir   Jain   had   deposed   that   they   were 

deceived by the accused to get the vehicle transferred first in 

the  name of his mother Smt. Laxmi Devi and from Laxmi Devi 


C.C. No. 13/11
 to Shri R.S. Bhardwaj.   They were in the position of witnesses 

and not  accused in this case. 
</p>
<p id="p_189">
The   main   file   of   the   bus   on   the   basis   of   which   the 
allegations have been made not produced in the Court.

</p><p id="p_190">85.    It is a matter of record that the file relating to the transfer 

of the vehicle of bus No. DL­1P 5290 had gone missing. This 

was deposed by defence evidence DW­1 Shri Satish Kumar as 

well where he had stated that he had made personal best efforts 

to   trace   the   record   of   the   said   file   but   the   same   was   not 

available.  This is a fact  which was also take note of during the 

testimony of PW­3 Inspector Sudhir Jain where at the time of 

exhibiting   RC   Ex.   PW3/A   there   was   an   objection   raised   that 

since it was a photocopy it could not have been exhibited. The 

Ld. Predecessor of the Court had made an observation that the 

Registration   File   of   this   vehicle   i.e.   bus   No.   DL­1P   5290   is 

missing from the official record and copy of the same can be 

considered to be a secondary evidence.  I am, therefore, of the 

opinion non­availability of the file would have not adverse impact 

on the outcome of this case.  
</p>
<p id="p_191">C.C. No. 13/11
 There   is   nothing   on   record   to   show   that   something   was 
missing which was required to be done for the transfer of 
registration certificate etc.


</p><p id="p_192">86.    According to the learned defence counsel first of all there 

is nothing on record to show that there was something missing 

which was required for the transfer of the ownership of vehicle. 

He has also submitted that if the surrender slip had not been 

submitted by the accused later on, as per the assurance given 

by   the   accused,   why   did   Shri   Sudhir   Jain   did   not   make   any 

inquiry from the accused as to not supplying the surrender slip 

to him or taken steps for stopping the transfer of RC in the name 

of Smt. Laxmi Devi. 
</p>
<p id="p_193">

</p><p id="p_194">87.    It has already come on record that the file relating to this 

case had been missing for long time.  Therefore, obviously there 

is no record available with regard to the transfer of the vehicle. 

As has been noted above there is, however, copious amount of 

oral evidence available on record that the accused had tried to 



C.C. No. 13/11
 influence Shri C.L. Meena and Shri Sudhir Jain for transferring 

the   vehicle   in   the   name   of   Smt.   Laxmi   Devi   without   the 

surrender   slip   on   the   pretext   that   he   would   supply   the   same 

soon. There is nothing to doubt their testimony.   It has already 

been discussed before that actually there was no permit ever 

received by Shri Ishwar Lal.   If there was no permit issued to 

Shri Ishwar Lal, there was no question of it being surrendered. 

One   may   also   notice   that   if   the   surrender   slip   had   been   on 

record   there   was   no   necessity   for   the   accused   to   have 

submitted forged application for the surrendering the permit with 

the signatures of Ishwal Lal and also an affidavit sworn in his 

name.     If   all   these   facts   are   put   together   then   even   in   the 

absence of actual record being available, there can only be one 

conclusion that at the time of submission of application for the 

transfer of vehicle in the name of Smt. Laxmi Devi, there was no 

permit surrender slip available. 
</p>
<p id="p_195">

</p><p id="p_196">88.    As far as question of Shri Sudhir Jain not making inquiry 

from   the   accused   about   non   supplying   the   surrender   slip   is 


C.C. No. 13/11
 concerned the accused could  have taken benefit of it if he had 

cross­examined the witness Shri Sudhir Jain on these lines.  At 

one stage in reply to the question by the defence counsel the 

witness had stated  "RC  was transferred in the  name of Smt.  

Laxmi   Devi   as   accused   Prakash   Chand,   who   was   working  

under me had given an undertaking to submit the surrender slip  

by   evening   on   the   same   day."    After   this   answer   had   come, 

there   was   no   question   put   to   the   witness   thereafter   if   this 

witness had later on made inquries from Prakash Chand if he 

had not submitted the surrender slip later on.  It may be noted 

that   narration   which   comes   in   the   cross­examination   of   a 

witness   is entirely different from the narration which comes in 

examination in chief of a witness.  In the examination in chief the 

witness   is   supposed   to   say  things   of   his  own   relevant   to   the 

case giving complete narration of facts.   In the case of cross­

examination,   however,   a   witness   is   expected   to   reply   to   the 

questions only which have been put to him specifically for the 

cross­examination   and   not   beyond   that.   It   was,   therefore, 

responsibility   of   the   learned   defence   counsel   in   the   cross­


C.C. No. 13/11
 examination to have elicited   the response from the witness, if 

this witness had after the registration certificate had been issued 

had asked the accused ever to submit the surrender slip.   As 

has   already   been   noted   above   in   the   absence   of   any   cross­

examination on these lines the learned defence counsel cannot 

take benefit of it. 
</p>
<p id="p_197">
No surrender slip required in case of vehicles purchased by 
auction.   
</p>
<p id="p_198">89.   The learned defence counsel had made a reference to the 

testimony   of   the   witness   PW­15   Shri   C.L.   Meena   who   was 

responsible   for   processing   the   case   for   transfer   of   vehicles 

wherein this witness had stated that he did not know that in case 

of a vehicle being purchased by way of auction it is necessary to 

ask for surrender slip  of  the permit.    I believe  if  the accused 

wanted to put across the question that as far as the vehicles 

which   are   purchased   by   way   of   auction,   there   was   no 

requirement   of   submissions   of   permit   surrender   slip,   then   he 

should have brought out this fact clearly in a positive manner by 

making reference to any rule or practice.  Merely by putting  one 

C.C. No. 13/11
 simple question and trying to make an exception that in case of 

vehicles purchased by way of auction, permit surrender slip was 

not necessary, is far fetched.

ORDER ON SENTENCE

CONVICTION

</pre><p id="p_202">      The   convict   has   been   convicted   under   <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_75">Section   471</a> 

punishable   in   the   same  manner  as  an   offence  under  <a href="/doc/1317063/" id="a_76">Section

</p><p id="p_203">2.    During   trial   it   was   established   that   an   ex­serviceman 

Ishwar  Lal  was selected  for grant  of  permit  by a  draw  of  lot. 

Pursuant  to  the  selection  he had  purchased  one  bus  bearing 

No.   DL­1P   5290   on   hire   purchase   basis.     The   vehicle   was 

transferred   in   his   name   vide   Registration   Certificate   dated 

07.04.1994.    He   was  informed   that   Route   No.   706   has  been 

alloted to him but permit was not actually issued to him. He had 

kept  approaching  the  Department  for  being  issued  the   permit 

but in vain.  So much so that because of the non­issuance of the 

permit he could not ply the bus and could not pay the monthly 

hire   charges   resulting   in   the   bus   being   repossessed   by   the 

Finance Company.   Convict who had been working as clerk in 

the Transport Department had himself approached the Finance 

Company   for   the   purchase   of   vehicle.   The   vehicle   was 

purchased in the name of his mother. Since the bus could not 

have  been  transferred  in   the  name  of  his  mother  without   the 


C.C. No. 13/11
 permit being surrendered and surrender slip produced of such 

surrender,   he   deceived   his   own   colleagues   to   get   the   bus 

transferred in the name of his mother and subsequently from his 

mother   to   one   Shri   R.S.   Bhardwaj   on   the   assurance   that   he 

would produce the surrender slip later, which he did not submit. 

Later on to cover up the non­submissions of the surrender slip 

he   had   submitted   an   application   alongwtih   an   affidavit   for 

"surrender of permit" with forged signatures of Shri Ishwar Lal. 



</p><p id="p_204">3.    I have heard the learned Public Prosecutor for CBI and 

also the learned defence counsel on the point of sentence and 

have gone through the record of the case.  
</p>
<p id="p_205">

</p><p id="p_206">4.    The learned Defence counsel made a request for taking a 

lenient view and to award minimum punishment to the convict 

for the following reasons:­ 

</p><p id="p_207">(i)   The convict is facing trial since, 1996.  He is 61 years old 

and has already retired from service. He is not maintaining good 

health since the year 2001.
</p>
<p id="p_208">
C.C. No. 13/11
</p><p id="p_209"> (ii)    His wife has already expired. He has an adopted son who 

is   living   separately   and   one   daughter   who   is   already  married 

and he is the only person to look after his old mother who is 

about 82 years old. 
</p>
<p id="p_210">

</p><p id="p_211">(iii)   Because of the present case he has not been able to get 

any pensionary benefit including gratuity etc.   He also did not 

get   two   promotions   because   of   the   pendency   of   the   present 

case. 
</p>
<p id="p_212">

</p><p id="p_213">4.      The   learned   Public   Prosecutor   on   the   other   hand   has 

made a request for handing out the maximum punishment to the 

convict   taking   into   consideration   the   manner  in   which   he  has 

committed the offence by deceiving his own colleagues and an 

ex­serviceman. 
</p>
<p id="p_214">

</p><p id="p_215">5.      As I can pick up the mitigating circumstance against the 

convict are: 
</p>
<p id="p_216">


C.C. No. 13/11
</p><p id="p_217"> (i)     the convict has been facing trial since the year 2000; 

</p><p id="p_218">(ii)    he is a sick person and is suffering from many diseases; 

and

</p><p id="p_219">(iii)   his   mother   who   is   aged   about   82   years   is   completely 

dependent upon him both financially and physically.  



</p><p id="p_220">6.      The aggravating circumstance on the other hand against 

him  is   that   he  grossly  misused   his  position   as  a   government 

servant to get something done, which he otherwise could not 

have,   by   deceiving   his   own   colleagues   and   had   gone   to   the 

extent of submitting forged papers to cover up his wrong doing. 



</p><p id="p_221">7.      Having   weighed   all   the   options   before   me   I   am   of   the 

considered opinion that though in this case there is no loss to 

the exchequer of the Government in terms of money but surely 

there is a question of loss of reputation for the Government as 

the acts like this give an impression to the public in general that 

government   servants   are   capable   of   bending   any   rule   / 

procedure, if they want to. I am of the view that the acts like this 


C.C. No. 13/11
 should   have   a   suitably   heavy   component   of   fine   and   also   of 

imprisonment   proportionate   to   the   offences   committed   taking 

into consideration the minimum and the maximum punishment 

provided for such offences.  
</p>
<p id="p_222">


</p><p id="p_223">8.     In   the   light   of   above   discussion   I   am   sentencing   the 

convict   to   undergo   rigorous   imprisonment   of   one   year   for 

committing the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_81">Section 471</a> IPC read 

with   <a href="/doc/1317063/" id="a_82">Section   465</a>   IPC   and   also   pay   a   fine   of   Rs.   25,000/­ 

(Rs. Twenty Five Thousand only).   I am further sentencing the 

convict to undergo rigorous imprisonment of Two years under 

<a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_83">Section 420</a> IPC and to pay a fine of Rs. 25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty 

Five   Thousand   only).     I   am   also   sentencing   the   convict   to 

undergo   rigorous   imprisonment   of   Two   years   under   <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_84">Section 

13(2)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act read with <a href="/doc/1281473/" id="a_85">Section 13(1)</a>

</p><p id="p_224">(d)(ii)   of   the   Act   and   to   pay   a   fine   of   Rs.   50,000/­   (Rs.   Fifty 

Thousand only). 
</p>
<p id="p_225">


C.C. No. 13/11
</p><p id="p_226"> 9.     All the sentences of imprisonment shall run concurrently. 

In this case I want the convict to actually pay the overall fine of 

Rs.   1,00,000/­     (   Rupees   One   Lac   only   )   which   has   been 

imposed   by   this   order   and,   therefore,   I   have   purposely   not 

provided any imprisonment in default of payment of fine.   I am 

giving time to the convict to make the payment of the fine within 

two weeks from now.  In case of his failure to pay the fine during 

the   said   period,   steps   would   be   taken   for   recovery  of   fine   in 

accordance   with   the   <a href="/doc/89440/" id="a_86">Section   421</a>   of   the   Code   of   Criminal 

Procedure, 1973.
</p>
<p id="p_227">

</p><p id="p_228">10.    The convict had not been arrested in this case and has not 

spent   any   time   in   jail   during   the   entire   course   of   the   trial. 

Therefore, there is no benefit under <a href="/doc/914361/" id="a_87">Section 428</a> Cr.P.C. needs 

to be given to the convict in this case.
