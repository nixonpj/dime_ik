<p id="p_1">4   23-07-2015                  The petitioner is a power generating Company as

                 defined under the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_2">Electricity Act</a> 2003 (for short „the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_3">Electricity

                 Act</a>‟), whereas the principal respondent is the Power Company

                 called „Bihar State Power Holding Company Ltd. (for short‟ the

                 Power Company‟) which constitutes integral part of the erstwhile

             entered into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) on 09.07.2010

             on being selected as the successful bidder for a long term

             procurement of electricity. The writ application has been filed

             inter alia for issuance of an appropriate writ/order/direction to

             declare that PPA dated 09.07.2010 has become null and void and

             also to treat the PPA as validly terminated by the petitioner-

             Company in view of the termination notice dated 9th July, 2015

             (Annexure-8)         issued under <a href="/doc/1678224/" id="a_4">Article 11.5.1</a> read with Articles

             4.7.1,4.7.3 and 9.3 of the PPA. Further relief prayed for is to

             restrain the respondent Power Company from invoking the Bank

             Guarantee provided by the petitioner- Company in the sum of Rs.

             135,00,00,000/- (also called            Contract Performance Guarantee)

             which was required to be furnished by the petitioner company in

             terms of the requests for proposal (RFP). Other consequential

             relief has also been prayed.

<p id="p_3">                             The background facts out of which the writ

             application germinates may briefly be noticed. The petitioner

             company claims to be a pioneer in developing/producing power.

             Currently it is developing a thermal power project in the State of

             Jharkhand.In the year 2005 in response to an advertisement issued

             by the concerned ministry of the Union of India, the petitioner-

             Company applied and was allocated the Chakla Coal Block lying

             in the State of Jharkhand for Pit-head Power Plant. On the basis

             of the MOU and the recommendation of the Union of India it was

             allocated the Chakla Coal Block on 20.02.2007. The respondent

             Power Company published                 on 20.10.2009 a notice inviting

             tender (NIT) for long term procurement of electricity through

             tariff based competitive bidding. The Petitioner-Company

             submitted the papers               including the documents relating to

             allocation of Chakla Coal Block to it. The petitioner-Company

             was selected as the lowest bidder and the letter of intent (LOI)

             was issued on 08.06.2010. The petitioner-Company accepted the

             terms and conditions of the LOI on 11.06.2010 and an agreement

             was signed on 09.07.2010. As required under the agreement the

             petitioner      company        submitted      the   Contract    Performance

             Guarantee from the respondent ICICI Bank for an amount of Rs.

             135 crores. As per the PPA entered between them the petitioner

             company was required to supply power for a period of 25 years

             at the agreed tariff. The scheduled delivery date (SDD) was

             09.07.2014. A grace period of one year was also provided under

             the agreement. Due to diverse reasons spelt out in the writ petition

             as also in the notice dated 09.07.2015 (Annexure-8) the petitioner-

             Company         claim to have terminated the agreement invoking

             Clause/Articles 9.3 of the PPA which provides                  Force Majeure
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> Patna High Court CWJC No.10122 of 2015 (4) dt.23-07-2015</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                         4/13</span>




             Clause which gives option to both the parties to terminate the

             agreement if a natural and unavoidable catastrophe has occurred

             which materially interrupts the expected course of events. The

             present writ petition has been filed in the aforesaid background

             for the relief(s) as noticed hereinabove.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                             A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the

             respondent Power Company. It has been stated inter alia that the

             right of the parties arising out of bilateral agreement entered

             between them should not be entertained by this Court. The

             conduct of the petitioner- Company would show that it had failed

             to supply power even from the alternative source and within the

             scheduled date of delivery (SDD) at the tariff rate agreed under

             the PPA. The scheduled date of delivery expired without any

             extension being allowed to the petitioner Company. Until the

             rights of the parties arising out of              PPA    are decided no

             consequential relief which appears to be the main relief of the

             petitioner-Company can be granted. The omission and failure on

             the part of the petitioner Company caused a huge loss to the

             respondent Power Company insomuch so it has upset the plans

             of the power purchase in the interest of the public. The petitioner-

             Company had earlier requested                 for extension of SDD from

             09.07.2014 and 17.10.2015 respectively to further three years.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> Patna High Court CWJC No.10122 of 2015 (4) dt.23-07-2015</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                         5/13</span>




             Such request was made invoking Clause/Articles 9.5 of the PPA.

             In the said communication the petitioner company spelt out the

             uncertainty prevailing in reallocation of Chakla Coal Block and

             referred to the pending proceeding(s) in the Hon‟ble Supreme

             Court and the Jharkhand High Court.               Curiously enough, apart

             from extension of           time due to the        alleged intervention of

             unavoidable uncertainties it was also stated that it would now be

             unprofitable for the petitioner-Company to supply power at the

             bid out tariff as per the PPA. Diverse reasons were stated to justify

             escalation in O&amp;M expenses and other financial burdens. The

             agreement was reached between the parties for supply of 450 MW

             and 300 MW           power for a long term of 25 years at a levellised

             tariff of Rs. 3.057/KWh and Rs. 3.69/KWh respectively. The

             petitioner-Company had also offered to supply part of the power

             to the procurer (the respondent               company) from the alternate

             source. The representatives of the parties had met with each other

             on few occasions. The petitioner Company ultimately did not

             provide power within the SDD. The grounds made in the writ

             petition were concisely the grounds for extension of SDD by three

             years as also the revision in the bid out tariff. The respondent

             power company having considered the same and in the light of

             the discussions which had taken place between them by                   a

             of power to the State which was facing acute power shortage

             causing public injury in diverse manners. In order to overreach the

</p><p id="p_6">                             The learned Senior counsel         for the petitioner

             company has submitted that Force Majeure clause/articles of the

             PPA read with <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_11">Article 4.7.1( c)</a> and <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_12">4.7.3</a> clothe the petitioner

             Company with power or discretion to terminate the PPA if there

             has been onset          of circumstances contemplated under <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_13">Article

             4.7.1(c)</a> of the PPA. Even the respondent power Company in the

             show cause notice dated 16.7.2014 acknowledged the intervention

             of the circumstances which rendered the performance of the

             contract having time essence almost impossible. The counsel has

             submitted that coal is the fuel/raw material for a thermal power

             generation Company              like the petitioner Company which is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13"> Patna High Court CWJC No.10122 of 2015 (4) dt.23-07-2015</span>

             indispensable. Several litigations were pending in relation thereto

             in Courts which made performance of the contract                    almost

             impossible. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the month of

             September, 2014 declared all allocation(s) of coal blocks

             illegal/null and void. The other circumstances, as pleaded in the

             writ petition and the communication of the petitioner Company

             would show that there exists             a    situation conceived under the

             PPA entitling the petitioner Company to terminate the agreement

             and get the CPG refunded/returned. Acting bonafidely,                   the

             petitioner Company in such circumstances in the communication

             made in April, 2014 had requested                  the respondent    power

             Company to give a re-look to the diverse stipulations of the PPA

             and extend the SDD and also to consider marginal escalation in

             the rate(s) of power, in view of the fact that captive coal block

             of the petitioner Company could not be                        utilized and

             transportation        of coal       from the       alternate source would

             necessarily result in rise in the cost price. The stand of the

             respondent Power Company is arbitrary in not treating the PPA

             terminated in view of the notice/communication of the petitioner

             Company contained in Annexure-8.

<p id="p_7">                             Per contra, counsel for the respondent Company

             would argue that the writ application lacks in bonafide. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15"> Patna High Court CWJC No.10122 of 2015 (4) dt.23-07-2015</span>

             circumstances are replete to demonstrate that with a view to cover

             up the breach of the agreement which undoubtedly has caused

             huge loss of public money, the present writ application has been

             filed in the shape of a declaratory suit. It is a camouflaged

             proceeding. In fact, the petitioner Company had earlier requested

             for extension of SDD and enhancement of rates/tariff for supply

             of power/energy . The same was not acceded to by the respondent

             power Company. Admittedly, the date of SDD has already expired

             and the petitioner Company has                 prima facie defaulted in

             complying with the terms and conditions of the contract (PPA).

             The respondent Power Company has yet to decide on the fate of

             the PPA in view of the attending circumstances. The writ

             application is, therefore,              wholly premature. It has been

             emphatically argued that protection of Force Majeure Clause in

             the attending facts and circumstances of the case would not be

             available      to the petitioner-Company. While arguing on the

             maintainability of the application, the counsel has submitted that

             the State Government               enacted Bihar   Public Works Contract

             Disputes Arbitration Tribunal for redressal of grievance relating

             to contracts between the Government or its instrumentality and

             other party. Any such dispute ought to have been raised before

             the Tribunal but that too after a decision is finally taken.

</p><p id="p_8">                             Rights and liabilities of the parties arising out of

             contract would depend on appreciation of diverse facts in the light

             of different contemplations/conditions of the contract. Normally

             the writ Court is not expected to examine such grievance which

             necessarily involves appreciation of disputed facts unless it is

             demonstrably shown that the party to the contract has acted

             completely arbitrarily and de- horse          the conditions of contract.

             The contention of the petitioner Company is                    that the

             circumstances indicated in the notice (Annexure-8) would

             constitute a case where the plea of Force Majeure can be raised

             and bonafidely invoked. On the other hand, it has been contended

             by the respondent that the SDD had already expired well before

             the final order passed by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in August or

             September, 2014 when the coal block allotted to the petitioner

             Company was declared null and void and set aside. By the said

             time the petitioner Company had already defaulted in supplying

             the energy/power to the respondent power Company. Dispute and

             difference of such kind would essentially involve appreciation of

             diverse facts and circumstances pleaded in support of the rival

             claims. It has been brought to the notice of the Court that the State

             Government has already constituted a Tribunal for adjudication

             of such disputes arising out of contract in which one party is the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19"> Patna High Court CWJC No.10122 of 2015 (4) dt.23-07-2015</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                         11/13</span>




             State or its instrumentality. Learned counsel for the petitioner, on

             the other hand, has submitted that under the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_14">Electricity Act</a>, 2003

             the Bihar Electricity Regulatory Commission shall have the

             power to adjudicate upon matters between generating Companies

             and the licensee, if a dispute has arisen between them. Thus, it

             appears both the parties are in agreement that there is statutory

             mechanism/forum provided for resolution of the disputes arising

             between them. Such rival claims of the parties, in my view, cannot

             be looked into in writ jurisdiction in order to come to a firm and

             final conclusion in the matter. They can be appropriately gone

             into in the arbitral proceedings or by the Civil Court where these

             shells of disputed facts can be percolated to appreciate the rival

             claims of the parties. The contention of the petitioner Company

             that in not accepting           the notice    given to the respondent -

             Company by the petitioner Company and treating the agreement

             terminated entitling the petitioner Company to get the Contract

             Performance Guarantee returned , in my view, is not well

             founded. It has not been argued by the either party that any

             Clause/Article of PPA specifically prohibits such resolution of

             dispute by Arbitral Tribunal.

             the petitioner Company has validity at least for a period of more

             than two years from now. The dispute raised herein is a matter

             which can alternatively be relooked              by both the parties in the

             interest of the petitioner Company as well as the citizens of the

             State of Bihar who are to be benefited. There                may be valid

             grounds on either side some of which are not in much dispute.

             contentions of the parties, this Court is of the view that the

             issues/disputes which have been raised herein cannot be

             entertained in the writ jurisdiction of the Court. The parties have

             forum(s) to raise such disputes effectively for adjudication. The

             prayer(s) made in the application is/are, therefore, declined. Both

             parties are granted            liberty to       approach the appropriate

             forum/Tribunal for redressal of the grievance in case the

             respondent Company declines                   the request of the petitioner

             Company for extension of time and reasonable enhancement of

             the agreed tariff of power and treat the attending circumstances

             as material breach of the               conditions of the agreement and

             thereby decide to terminate/rescind the PPA. In that event the

             respondent Company shall not invoke/ encash the bank guarantee

             furnished by the petitioner Company for a period of 15 days

             therefrom. This Court, however, would further clarify that such
