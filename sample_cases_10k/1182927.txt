<pre id="pre_1">           CASE NO.:
Appeal (civil)  1453 of 2005

PETITIONER:
Secretary to the Govt. and Anr.

RESPONDENT:
M. Senthil Kumar

DATE OF JUDGMENT: 28/02/2005

BENCH:
Arijit Pasayat &amp; S.H. Kapadia

JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">JUDGMENT

ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_3">The Government of Tamil Nadu questions legality of the judgment rendered by
the Madras High Court holding that the policy of the State Government in
providing 10% special quota to the children/wards of
serving/retired/deceased personnel of police and like forces is invalid.
</p>
<p id="p_4">A brief reference to the factual issue would suffice.
</p>
<p id="p_5">The Tamil Nadu Service Recruitment Board (in short `Recruitment Board')
published a Notification in several local dailies on 5.3.2000 calling for
applications filling up 1155 posts of Police Constables, Grade II. In the
Notification the Board had stated that 10% of the posts were reserved for
legal heirs of serving personnel, for ministerial staff and also for legal
heirs of those persons who had been invalidated on medical grounds. The
respondent (hereinafter referred to as the `applicant') filed an Original
Application before the Central Administrative Tribunal (in short the
`Tribunal'). The respondent-applicant was not found successful as he had
not faired well in the written test as well as the physical test. He was,
therefore, not held to be qualified for selection.
</p>
<p id="p_6">The Tribunal held that since the applicant had not qualified he was not fit
for selection. He had failed to get selected because his performance was
not satisfactory. It was further held that he was not entitled for any
preferential treatment. It is to be noted that there was no challenge by
the applicant before the Tribunal to validity of the policy because he
himself wanted to avail benefits under the policy. The respondent-applicant
filed a Writ Petition before the Madras High Court. A learned Single Judge
of the Madras High Court dismissed the writ petition on the ground that
writ petitioner had not come out successful in the tests. But at the same
time held that the preference which was being sought for on the ground of
descent was prohibited by <a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_1">Article 16(2)</a> of the Constitution of India, 1950
(in short the `Constitution'). It was held by relying on a decision of this
Court in <a href="/doc/1240424/" id="a_2">Yogendra Pal Singh v. Union of India</a>, AIR (1987) SC 1015 that
there cannot be any reservation on the basis of descent. It was held that
the reasoning of the Tribunal that reservation provided for wards of police
personnel is unconstitutional was in order. It was further noted that
though the reservation provided by the State had been applied in the case
of many persons wrongly, it would not be proper to invalidate the
appointments already made. Though it was urged by learned counsel for the
State that the constitutional validity of concerned policy was not in
issue, the High Court felt that in view of the declaration of law by this
Court the matter could be taken note of by it.
</p>
<p id="p_7">Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned senior counsel appearing for the State
submitted that there was no challenge to the policy by anybody. In fact the
respondent-applicant was relying on the policy. The Tribunal came to the
conclusion that the respondent-applicant before it was not entitled for any
preferential treatment. It did not express any opinion on the
constitutional validity of the provision. The High Court erroneously
declared the policy to be constitutionally invalid.
</p>
<p id="p_8">Though the service of notice had been duly effected, there is no appearance
on behalf of the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_9">We find that there was no challenge to the constitutional validity of the
policy providing for 10% special quota to the children/wards of
serving/retired/deceased personnel of police and like forces. The relevant
portion of the Government Order dated 10.9.2001 containing the policy is as
follows :
</p>
<p id="p_10">"The Government also direct that 10% quota be provided for dependents of
the serving police personnel and the wards/dependents of retired, deceased
and medically invalidated police personnel so as to boost up the morale and
strengthen the loyalty of the force. In case, it is not possible to fill up
the sports quota of 10%, the Government permit the filling up of the gap by
the dependents of the serving personnel so that the total percentage does
not exceed 20%."
</p>
<p id="p_11">Subsequently, on 26.3.2002 the aforesaid Government Order was amended and
the benefit was extended to the children/wards/dependents of the
ministerial staff of the Police Departments. The application before the
Tribunal was disposed of primarily on the ground that the applicant was not
suitable for selection. There was only one additional observation which
reads as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_12">"He is not entitled for any preferential treatment also."
</p>
<p id="p_13">Therefore, there was no express view expressed regarding the validity of
the policy decision by the Tribunal as wrongly concluded by the High Court.
Obviously, the High Court could not have made out a case for adjudication
which was not even part of the pleadings. <a href="/doc/55040/" id="a_3">In V.K. Majotra v. Union of
India</a>, [2003] 8 SCC 40 this Court observed as under :
</p>
<p id="p_14">"....Counsel for the parties are right in submitting that the point on
which the writ petition has been disposed of was not raised by the parties
in their pleadings. The parties were not at issue on the point decided by
the High Court....."
</p>
<p id="p_15"><a href="/doc/1367686/" id="a_4">In State of Maharashtra v. Jalgaon Municipal Council</a>, [2003] 9 SCC 731 this
Court at page 757 observed as under :
</p>
<p id="p_16">"..In the absence of any challenge having been laid, the constitutional
validity of the amendment cannot be gone into....."
</p>
<p id="p_17">Recently, in <a href="/doc/1859595/" id="a_5">The President, Poornathrayisha Seva Sangham, Thripunithura v.
K. Thilakan Kavenal and Ors</a>., (2005) 2 SCALE 1 in para 9 it was observed as
under :
</p>
<p id="p_18">"Above being the position, we feel that nothing further remains to be done
in this appeal except noticing that certain observations made, as regards
the functioning of the appellant-society and its credibility were
unnecessary. For the purpose of adjudication of the dispute before the High
Court which only related to the permission granted to use Oottupura, other
observations and views expressed by the Division Bench are, therefore,
treated as inoperative. Since disputed facts were involved, the High Court
should not have gone into them even in respect of the primary grievances of
the writ petitioner".
</p>
<p id="p_19">Since there was no challenge to the policy decision contained in the two
Government Orders the applicant did not get any opportunity to place his
stand before the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_20">Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that facts involved in
Yogendra Pal's case (supra) are clearly distinguishable from the facts of
the present case. The policy decision has been taken taking note of the
several special features which would have made the case of Yogendra Pal
clearly distinguishable. We need not go into the question about the
applicability of Yogendra Pal's case (supra) on the sole ground that there
was no challenge to the policy decision in the petition filed before the
Tribunal or before the High Court. Therefore, it was not open to the High
Court to dismiss the application on the additional ground that the policy
decision was unconstitutional, overlooking the fact that the respondent-
applicant was seeking relief under the policy decision. We have, therefore,
not expressed any opinion on the validity or otherwise of the policy
decision providing for 10% special quota to a particular group of
candidates. We set aside that part of the order of the High Court which
invalidates the policy decision. Other part of the order which deals with
lack of merits stands affirmed as there is no challenge to it by the
respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_21">The appeal is allowed with no order as to costs.
