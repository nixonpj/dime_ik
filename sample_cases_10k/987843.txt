 IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT MADRAS

DATED: 21/10/2003

CORAM

THE HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE A.KULASEKARAN

SECOND APPEAL No.1598 OF 2003
AND
C.M.P.No.14694 OF 2003

D.Dhanapal                     ...             Appellant

-Vs-

D.David Livingstone            ...             Respondent

!For appellant : Mr.T.Dhanyakumar

^For Respondent :  ---

        Appeal against the  judgment  and  decree  dated  20.12.2002  made  in
A.S.No.296  of  2002 on the file of the Principal District Judge, Namakkal, as
against the judgment and decree dated 20.09.2000 made in O.S.No.3 81  of  1998
on the file of the Principal District Munsif, Namakkal.

:J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        When the matter is listed for admission, after hearing the counsel for
the appellant, the same is disposed of in limine.
</p><p id="p_2">        2.   Defendant,  who lost before both the Courts below, has filed this
Second Appeal.
</p><p id="p_3">        3.  Suit in O.S.No.381 of 1998 was filed by the respondent herein  for
declaration  that  he  continues  to  be  the Secretary of the Society and for
consequential injunction, restraining the appellant  herein  from  interfering
with  the  normal functioning as Secretary of the Society, which is registered
under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act.
</p><p id="p_4">        4.  Before the trial Court, the respondent herein examined himself  as
P.W.1  and  one  Gnanadikan  as P.W.2 and marked Ex.A-1 dated 23.09.1967 , the
Society's Memorandum and By-laws; Ex.A-2, the registration certificate of  the
Society;  Ex.A-3,  extract of the Minutes of the General Body Meeting; Ex.A-4,
resignation letter submitted by the appellant herein.  On the other hand,  the
appellant  herein  had  not let any oral evidence and only marked Ex.B-1 dated
29.01.1997, original letter sent by P.W.2 to P.W.1.
</p><p id="p_5">        5.  The appellant herein canvassed before the Courts  below  that  the
Civil  Court  has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit; the respondent herein
was removed from the post of Secretary of the Society on 27.01  .1997  and  an
alternative  remedy  was  availed  of  by  the respondent before the appellate
authority and, hence, the suit filed was untenable.
</p><p id="p_6">        6.  The respondent herein had canvassed that the Tamil Nadu  Societies
Registration  Act  neither expressly nor impliedly bar the jurisdiction of the
Civil Court; the appellant herein had not placed any evidence either  oral  or
documentary to show that the respondent was removed from the post of Secretary
in  terms  of the by-laws; only an application, pointing out the illegal claim
of the appellant without the  requisite  signatures  of  1/3  members  of  the
Society,  was  filed,  which  would  not  mean  that the remedy sought for was
availed under Sections 36 of the Act.
</p><p id="p_7">        7.  The Courts below concurrently held that the appellant  herein  had
not  placed  any document to show that a resolution was passed on 27.01 .1997,
removing the respondent herein from the post of Secretary.  On  the  Contrary,
the  respondent  herein  had produced the Minutes Book, which does not contain
the minutes of the meeting, said to have been held on 27.01.1997, removing the
respondent.  The Courts below also concurrently held that under Rule 32 of the
By-laws of the Society, if any vacancy amongst the office bearers  during  the
year shall be filled by the governing body either from amongst its own members
or  from  amongst  the  members of the society and the elected person, filling
such vacancy shall hold office until the next Annual General  Meeting  of  the
Society.   Under  by-law  10,  if  at any time, any member is requested by one
month notice in writing by 3/4th of all the other members to retire, he  shall
ipso facto  cease  to  be  a  member.    The  appellant  herein  has  also not
established that the said by-law 10 was invoked against the respondent herein.
The above said facts are not controverted before me.
</p><p id="p_8">        8.  The substantial questions of law, which arise for consideration in
this Second Appeal, are :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        i) Whether the suit is maintainable ?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">        ii) Whether the respondent is estopped from filing a suit ?</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">        iii) Whether the respondent herein is  entitled  to  the  reliefs,  as
claimed in the plaint ?
</p>
<p id="p_10">        9.  Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure read as follows:
</p><p id="p_11">        9.Courts  to  try  all civil suits unless barred :- The Courts shall (
subject to the provisions herein contained) have jurisdiction to try all suits
of a civil  nature  excepting  suits  of  which  their  cognizance  is  either
expressly or impliedly barred.
</p><p id="p_12">        Explanation I :  A suit in which the right to property or to an office
is  contested is a suit of a civil nature, notwithstanding that such right may
depend entirely on  the  decision  of  questions  as  to  religious  rites  or
ceremonies.
</p><p id="p_13">        Explanation II  :    For the purpose of this section, it is immaterial
whether or not any fees are attached to the office referred to in  Explanation
I or whether or not such office is attached to a particular place.
</p>
<p id="p_14">        10.  It  is  seen from Section 9 C.P.C.  that every presumption should
be made in favour of the jurisdiction of a Civil  Court.    The  exclusion  of
jurisdiction  of  Civil  Courts  is  not  to  be  readily inferred, until such
exclusion explicitly expressed or clearly implied.
</p><p id="p_15">        11.  In AIR 2000 SUPREME  COURT  2220  (<a href="/doc/8458746/" id="a_1">State  of  Andhra  Pradesh  v.
Manjeti Laxmi Kantha Rao</a>), the Supreme Court has held as under:
</p><p id="p_16">        "The  test  adopted  in  examining  such a question is (I) whether the
legislative intent to exclude arises explicitly or by  necessary  implication,
and   (II)   whether  the  statute  in  question  provides  for  adequate  and
satisfactory alternative remedy to a party aggrieved by an  order  made  under
it.   Where  a  statute gives finality to the orders of the special tribunals,
jurisdiction of the civil Courts must be held  to  be  excluded  if  there  is
adequate remedy to do what the civil Courts would normally do in a suit.  Such
provision,  however,  does not exclude those cases where the provisions of the
particular Act have not been complied with or the statutory Tribunal  has  not
acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure."
</p>
<p id="p_17">        12.  In  AIR 1995 SUPREME COURT 2001 (<a href="/doc/634316/" id="a_2">P.M.A.Metropolitan v.  Moran Mar
Marthoma</a>), the Supreme Court has held as under :
</p><p id="p_18">        "One of the basic principles of law is that every right has a  remedy.
Ubi Jus ibis remediem is the well known maxim.  Every civil suit is cognizable
unless  it  is  barred, "there is an inherent right in every person to bring a
suit of a civil nature and unless the suit is barred by statute, one  may,  at
one's peril,  bring  a  suit  of  one's  choice.    It  is no answer to a suit
howsoever frivolous the claim, that the law  confers  no  such  right  to  sue
'<a href="/doc/1350326/" id="a_3">Smt.Ganga Bai v.    Vijay  Kumar</a>, AIR 1 974 SC 1126.  The expansive nature of
the Section is demonstrated by use of phraseology both positive and  negative.
The  earlier  part opens the door widely and latter debars entry to only those
which are expressly or impliedly barred.  The two explanations,  one  existing
from  inception  and  latter  added  in 1976 bring out clearly the legislative
intention of extending operation of the  Section  to  such  religious  matters
where  right to property or office is involved irrespective of whether any fee
is attached to the office or not.  The language used is  simple  but  explicit
and clear.     It  is  structured  on  the  basic  principle  of  a  civilised
jurisprudence that absence of machinery for enforcement of  right  renders  it
nugatory.   The  heading  which  is  normally  key  to  the Section brings out
unequivocally that all civil suits are cognizable  unless  barred.    What  is


meant  by  it is explained further by widening the ambit of the Section by use
of the word 'shall' and the expression, all suits of  a  civil  nature  unless
expressly or impliedly barred.'.
</p>
<p id="p_19">        13.   The  above  said  judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court make it
clear that Section 9 of CPC primarily deals with the question of Civil  Courts
jurisdiction to entertain a cause, until it is expressly or impliedly barred.
</p><p id="p_20">        14.   It  is  canvassed  by the learned counsel for the appellant that
under Section 36 (2) of the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act,  the  Civil
Courts jurisdiction is barred.  Hence, the suit filed by the respondent is not
at all maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_21">        15.   Now,  we  look  into  Section  36  of  the  Tamil Nadu Societies
Registration Act.
</p><p id="p_22">        "36.  Power of Registrar to inquire into  the  affairs  of  registered
society :
</p><p id="p_23">        (1)  The  Registrar  may, of his own motion or on the application of a
majority of the members of the committee of a registered  society  or  on  the
application  of  not  less  than  one  third of the members of that registered
society, or if so moved by the District Collector, hold, or direct some person
authorised by the Registrar by order in writing in  this  behalf  to  hold  an
inquiry  into  the  constitution,  working  and  financial  condition  of that
registered society.
</p><p id="p_24">        (2) An application to the Registrar under  sub-section  (1)  shall  be
supported  by  such  evidence  as the Registrar may require for the purpose of
showing that the applicants have good reason for applying for an inquiry.
</p><p id="p_25">        (3) The Registrar may require the applicants under sub-section (1)  to
furnish  such security as he thinks fit for the costs of the proposed inquiry,
before the inquiry is held.
</p><p id="p_26">        ............."
</p>
<p id="p_27">        16.  Under Section 36 of the Act, the Registrar may, of his own motion
or on the application of a majority of the  members  of  the  committee  of  a
registered  society  or  on  the application of not less than one third of the
members of that society, or if so moved by the District  Collector,  hold,  or
direct  some  person  authorised  by the Registrar by order in writing in this
behalf to hold  an  inquiry  into  the  constitution,  working  and  financial
condition  of that society; an application to the Registrar shall be supported
by such evidence and that the Registrar may require the applicants to  furnish
such  security  as he thinks fit for the costs of the proposed inquiry, before
the inquiry is held.
</p><p id="p_28">        17.  A careful reading of the Section 36 reveals no express bar to the
Civil Courts.
</p><p id="p_29">        18.  It is also argued by the learned counsel for the  appellant  that
once  it is established that the requisite machinery is available, it shall be
deemed as an implied bar to the Civil Courts.
</p><p id="p_30">        19.  Normally, where a special tribunal or a public body is created by
or under the authority or an  Act  of  the  legislature  for  the  purpose  of
determining  the  rights,  which  are  the  creation  of  the  Act,  then, the
jurisdiction of the tribunal or of that body is,  unless  provided  otherwise,
exclusive, and  Civil  Court  cannot take cognizance of such matter.  The mere
fact that a special sta tute provides for certain remedies may not, by itself,
exclude the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to deal with a case brought before
it in respect of some matters covered by the statute.  Section 36 is merely an
enabling provision.  If the aggrieved party approaches the Registrar or on his
own motion, then, it shall be lawful for the Registrar to conduct  an  enquiry
and communicate  the  report of the enquiry.  It does not mean to deem it as a
bar to the jurisdiction of the Civil Court.   There  must  be  at  least  some
implication to  show that the Civil Court cannot entertain.  I do not find any
such provision available in the Act.  Hence, I have no hesitation to hold that
the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is not even impliedly barred.
</p>
<p id="p_31">        20.  An application was filed, pointing out the illegal claim  of  the
appellant  without  requisite  signatures  of  1/3  members of the society, as
contemplated under Section 36.  As rightly held by the Courts below, the  said

action  would  not  mean  that  the  respondent  had invoked the provisions of
Section 36 of the Act.  Hence,  the  said  application  would  not  estop  the
respondent from filing the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_32">        21.   In  this  case,  the respondent prayed for a declaration that he
continues to  be  the  Secretary  of  the  Society  and  for  a  consequential
injunction only  against  the  appellant  herein.    In order to establish his
right, the respondent herein had rightly chosen  the  relief,  by  filing  the
suit.   The  document produced by the respondent before the Courts below would
prove beyond reasonable doubt that he is entitled to the relief sought for  in
the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_33">        22.  For the foregoing reasons, all the three substantial questions of
law are answered against the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_34">        23.  Second  Appeal,  therefore, fails and is dismissed in limine.  No
costs.  Consequently, the connected C.M.P.is also dismissed.
