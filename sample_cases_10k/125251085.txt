 Judicial   Magistrate   First   Class,   Tumsar,   by   and   under   which, 

 respondent 1 (hereinafter referred to as "the accused" is acquitted 

 of   offence   punishable   under   <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_1">section   138</a>   of   the   Negotiable 

 Instruments Act, 1881 ('Act' for short).

 2]               Heard Shri  A.M. Quazi, the  learned counsel  for  the 

 appellant,   Shri   K.S.   Motwani,   the   learned   counsel   for   the 

 respondent 1 and Ms. T.H. Udeshi, the learned Additional Public 

 Prosecutor for respondent 2/State.
</p>
<p id="p_3">   

 3]               The gist of the complaint instituted by the appellant 

 (hereinafter referred to as "the complainant") is that he extended 

 by   hand   loan   of   Rs.65,000/-   in   cash   to   the   accused   in   March, 

 2005.  The  repayment   of  the  hand  loan   was  to  be   done  in  two 

 months. The accused did not repay, the complainant pursued the 

 issue and the accused handed over cheque dated 21.06.2006 for 

 Rs.65,000/- to discharge the existing liability, to wit, repayment of 

 the hand loan. According to the complainant, the hand loan was 

 extended   in   view   of   the   cordial   relationship   between   the 

 complainant and the accused.

 4]               Concededly,   the   complainant   was   then   serving   as   a 

 Sectional   Engineer   with   Public   Works   Department   at   Tumsar. 

 The accused is concededly, a contractor. However, what is disputed 

 by   the   complainant   is   that   the   accused   executed   a   contract   on 

 behalf of one Harishankar Singh, who was awarded the contract of 

 road repairs. This assumes some significance since the defence of 

 the   accused   is   that   he   handed   over   two   blank   cheques   to   the 

 complainant, as security for the payment of the illegal gratification 

 which   was   demanded   by   the   complainant.   The   defence   is   that 

 since the accused did not pay the illegal gratification as demanded 

 by the complainant, one of the two cheques was misused.

   

 5]               Shri Quazi, the learned counsel for the complainant 

 submits   that   the   order   of   acquittal   dangerously   borders   on 

 perversity. The learned Magistrate was not alive to the statutory 

 presumption under <a href="/doc/1177058/" id="a_2">section 118(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_3">139</a> of the Act. The police 

 report   Exh.26,   allegedly   lodged   by   the   accused,   was   after   the 

 receipt of the statutory notice and ought to have been discarded 

 altogether, is the submission. According to the learned counsel for 

 the   complainant,   the   statutory   presumptions   which   stood 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">::: Uploaded on - 30/11/2017                         ::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2017 01:27:57 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">  apeal289.14.J.odt                       4</span>




 activated, have not been rebutted by the accused.

  

 6]               Concededly, there is no documentary proof evidencing 

 that the complainant extended hand loan of Rs.65,000/- in cash to 

 the accused. The complainant is not in a position even to disclose 

 the  date  on  which the said hand loan is  extended. The alleged 

 hand loan is not reflected in the income tax returns. In any event, 

 complainant did not produce on record the income tax returns.



 7]               Shri Quazi, the learned counsel for the complainant 

 however, invited my attention to Exh.36 which purports to be a 

 certificate signed by one Wasnik whose signature is identified by 

 CW   3   Shri   Radheshyam.   Shri   Quazi   submits,   that   the   said 

 certificate dated 31.08.2006 would show that even in the past the 

 complainant has  extended financial  assistance  of  Rs.10,000/- to 

 the accused. I am afraid, certificate Exh.36 does not take the case 

 of   the   complainant   any   further.   It   is   one   thing   to   say   that   the 

 document is exhibited and another thing to say that the contents 

 of the document are duly proved. The record on the basis of which 

 Exh.36   is   allegedly   issued   is   not   produced   before   the   Court. 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">::: Uploaded on - 30/11/2017                             ::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2017 01:27:57 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">  apeal289.14.J.odt                     5</span>




 Mr. Wasnik, the author of the certificate is not examined. C.W. 3 

 does   not   claim   to   have   any   personal   knowledge   or   knowledge 

 derived   from   official   record   that   the   contents   of   the   certificate 

 correct.  All  that   C.W.  3  says   is  that  since   he  was   working   with 

 Mr.   Wasnik,   he   is   in   a   position   to   identify   the   signature. 

 The certificate dated 31.08.2006 is exhibited on the basis of the 

 said evidence. Be that as it may, the contents of the certificate have 

 not been proved.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     

 8]               Ms. Udeshi, the learned A.P.P. would submit, that it is 

 not sufficient for the appellant to demonstrate that a second view 

 is possible. This Court, ought not to interfere in the judgment of 

 acquittal  unless the  view taken is  demonstrable perverse, is  the 

 submission.   The   learned   A.P.P.   is   right   in   her   submission   that 

 merely because this Court may have a second view, the judgment 

 of acquittal ought not to be interfered with, if the view taken by 

 the Magistrate is a possible or plausible view. 



 9]               I have given my anxious consideration to the evidence 

 on record and the conclusions drawn by the learned Magistrate on 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">::: Uploaded on - 30/11/2017                          ::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2017 01:27:57 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">  apeal289.14.J.odt                     6</span>




 the   basis   thereof.   The   learned   Magistrate   has   held   that   the 

 statutory presumptions have been rebutted by the accused. Be it 

 noted, that the accused has stepped into the witness box as D.W. 1. 

 One  Mr. Selukar  is  examined as  D.W. 2. One  of  the  documents 

 which have been produced and proved in the evidence of D.W. 2 is 

 Exh.83   which   is   a   letter   addressed   by   the   accused   dated 

 18.12.2006  inter alia  making a grievance that the bills in respect 

 of   the   work   allotted   to   Harishankar   Singh   are   not   settled. 

 The significance of the said letter is that the accused has brought 

 on   record   some   connection   or   nexus   with   the   work   allotted   to 

 Harishankar Singh. It is not suggested to the accused that the said 

 letter is a fabricated document or is written only create a record. 

 The   authenticity   of   the   letter   is   not   in   doubt.   The   letter   is 

 produced   by   Mr.   Selokar   D.W   .2   who   is   serving   as   Deputy 

 Executive   Engineer.   The   inference   drawn   by   the   learned 

 Magistrate on the basis of the cross-examination of C.W.1 and the 

 defence evidence is certainly not perverse. While there could be a 

 second   view,   as   is   vehemently   argued   by   Shri   Quazi,   I   am   not 

 inclined   to   substitute   the   view   of   the   learned   Magistrate   with 

 another view, assuming that the second hypothesis suggested by 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">::: Uploaded on - 30/11/2017                          ::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2017 01:27:57 :::</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">   apeal289.14.J.odt                    7</span>




  Shri Quazi is a possible hypothesis.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

  10]              There   is   no   compelling   reason   demonstrated   for 

  warranting interference in the judgment of acquittal.



</p><pre id="pre_3">  11]              The appeal is sans merit and is rejected.
