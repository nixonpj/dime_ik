:ORDER  
</pre><p id="p_1">        This Criminal Original Petition has been filed to call for the records
of the learned Judicial Magistrate, Uthamapalayam in Cr.M.P.No.5980 of 2017
in C.C.No.376 of 2012 and set aside the order dated 18.09.2017.
</p><p id="p_2">        2.Heard the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner and the
learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.The petitioner is the accused in Cr.No.37 of 2012, which was
registered for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1552733/" id="a_2">Section 435</a> IPC and after filing
the charge sheet, the case was taken on file by the learned Judicial
Magistrate, Uthamapalayam in C.C.No.376 of 2012.  
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.It is stated that PW1 and PW2 were not cross examined, even though, 
they were examined in chief on 08.09.2016. It is further stated that PW3 to
PW8 were examined in chief on subsequent days and they were also not cross  
examined by the petitioner. Hence, the petitioner has filed a petition before
the lower Court, under <a href="/doc/1780550/" id="a_3">Section 311</a> Cr.P.C., in Cr.M.P.No.5980 of 2017 in
C.C.No.376 of 2012, for cross examination of PW1 to PW8. The said petition
was dismissed only on the ground that the petitioner has not cross examined
the witnesses, despite an opportunity was given to him and that the
petitioner has not explained the delay, which occurred in filing the
petition.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5.The petitioner has been charged for the offences under <a href="/doc/1552733/" id="a_4">Section 435</a>
IPC. It is to be noted that the witnesses PW1 to PW8 were examined between  
08.09.2016 and 06.06.2017. There is no material to indicate that serious
prejudice will be caused to the respondent, in case the witnesses were
allowed to cross examine by the petitioner. Having regard to the nature of
offences alleged to have been committed by the petitioner and the facts and
circumstances of the case, this Court is inclined to allow the petition
subject to terms.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6.As a result, the Criminal Original Petition is allowed and the order
dated 18.09.2017 made in Cr.M.P.No.5980 of 2017 in C.C.No.376 of 2012 on the 
file of the learned Judicial Magistrate, Uthamapalayam is set aside and the
petition in Cr.M.P.No.5980 of 2017 in C.C.No.376 of 2012 on the file of the
learned Judicial Magistrate, Uthamapalayam, stands allowed subject to the
condition that the petitioner shall deposit a sum of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees
Twenty Five Thousand only) to the credit of the Honourable Chief Justice
Relief Fund, Madurai Bench of Madras High Court, Madurai and on further
condition that the petitioner should cross examine PW1 to PW8 on the date
when they are available, without seeking any further adjournments on any
other ground. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
