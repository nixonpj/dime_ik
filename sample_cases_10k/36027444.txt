</p><pre id="pre_1">For Petitioner        :   Mr. Apurba Das
                          Mr. Prabir Rej

For State         :       Mrs. Chandreyi Alam


Heard On : July 7th, 2009.


Judgment On :             15-07-2009.



</pre><p id="p_4">      The petitioner challenging his conviction under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_1">Sections 138</a>/<a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_2">141</a> of the

Negotiable Instruments Act and sentence passed thereunder by the Learned

Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Calcutta preferred an appeal being Criminal

Appeal No. 10 of 2009 before the Learned Chief Judge, City Sessions Court,

Calcutta. The said appeal was filed along with an application for condonation of

delay. On March 3, 2009 the Learned Chief Judge directed to issue notice upon

the opposite parties as regards to the application for condonation of delay and on
 April 17, 2009 the Learned Appellate Court dismissed the said appeal for non-

appearance of the Counsel of the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      2.    The subject matter of challenge in the instant criminal revision is the

said order of dismissal which is quoted below;
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                   "Again the appellant has taken no steps although it is now 12
            noon. None appears on behalf of the appellant on repeated calls.
            Yesterday also no steps was taken by the appellant. Accordingly, the
            instant appeal being not admitted stands dismissed in limini. The
            appellant must surrender before the Ld. Court below within a
            fortnight."</blockquote><p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">      3.    Heard the Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner as

well as the Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the State.          In spite of

repeated calls, none appears on behalf of the private opposite party. Affidavit of

service filed in Court be kept with the records.

</p><p id="p_8">      4.    It is now well settled that no appeal can be dismissed for default on

the ground of absence of the Counsel and must be decided on merit. In the case

of Bani Singh Vs. State of U.P., reported in (1996) 4 SCC 720, it was held by the

Apex Court that no appeal should be dismissed in default but should be decided

on merit and if despite notice neither the appellant nor his lawyer appears, still

the Court should decide the appeal on merit. If the appellant is in jail in that

case, Court can appoint a lawyer at State expense to assist it or may appoint any

advocate as amicus curiae. In this connection reliance may also be placed in the

cases of (i) Shivaji Narayan Vs. State of Maharashtra, reported in AIR 1983 SC

1014, (ii) Badu Vs. State of Rajasthan, reported in 1995 SCC (Cri) 990 and (iii)

Krishan Singh Vs. State of M.P., reported in 1996 (9) SCC 372.
</p><p id="p_9">             Thus, the impugned order of dismissal of Appeal is not in accordance

with law and cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_10">            In the result, this criminal revision succeeds and the impugned order

stands set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_11">            The Criminal Appeal being No. 10 of 2009 along with the application

under <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_3">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act for condonation of delay is restored to the

file of the Learned Chief Judge, City Sessions Court, Calcutta and the Learned

Judge is directed to proceed with the matter in accordance with law.

</p><p id="p_12">            Criminal Section is directed to deliver urgent Photostat certified copy

of this Judgement to the parties, if applied for, as early as possible.
