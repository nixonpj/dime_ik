:ORDER  
</pre><p id="p_1">        The petitioner seeks a direction  to direct the 1st respondent to
transfer the investigation in Crime No.147/2016, on the file of the 3rd
respondent police to any other police after making proper investigation on
the basis of the petition, dated  29.01.2017.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned
Government Advocate (Crl. Side) for the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3. The petitioner states that he is having business in the name of
style of ?Krishnaveni Engineering Construction? and she had completed certain
works under contract given by one Icon Controls Private Limited Company. When 
she approached them for the settlement of the due from the said company, the
staffs of the company scolded her with abusive language and threatened her
with dire consequences. In the circumstances, she states that she had given a
complaint. Since, there is no progress in the investigation, she has
approached this Court.
</p>        
<p id="p_4">        4. The learned Government Advocate (Crl. Side), on instructions, would
submit that the complaint, which was filed by the petitioner, was enquired
into and closed as 'mistake of fact' on 06.06.2017. However, the learned
counsel for the petitioner states that he has no instructions from his client
about the notice of the closure report. However, a copy of the closure report
is served on the learned counsel for the petitioner today.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5. From the reading of the complaint, it is clear that the petitioner
has done some contract work for a company and some amount is due to her and   
for settlement of the said amount, she approached the company. Thereafter,
four unknown persons entered into her home and scolded her with abusive
language, threatened with dire consequences and assaulted her. Therefore she
has given a complaint. Since the compliant is closed as 'mistake of fact', it
is open to the petitioner to file a protest petition and give a private
complaint. For recovery of any money, she should approach the Civil Court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6.With the above observation, this Criminal Original Petition is
closed.
