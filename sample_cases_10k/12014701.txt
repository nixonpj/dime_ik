the parties. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">2.                         The present petition is under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_1">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation

</p><p id="p_5">3.                         The relation between petitioner and respondent is that of financier and 

loan taker.   The finance company, petitioner herein, has extended loan facility to the 

respondent   for   the   purpose   of   purchasing   of   vehicle/equipment   make   ELECTRIC 

GENERATING SET 380 KVA bearing engine No. 25361564 (hereinafter referred to as 

'asset').   The loan of Rs.9,37,179/­ was accepted by the respondent vide loan facility­

cum­hypothecation No. 4000CE00401478 dated 30.01.2013, and the same was agreed to 

be repaid by the respondent in 24 monthly installments of Rs.14,090/­ each for 1st to 6th 

installments   and   Rs.55,382/­   each   for   7th  to   24th  installments.     The   respondent   has 

hypothecated the asset to petitioner for securing the loan installments.   However, on 

default of payment, the finance company, petitioner herein, approached this Court u/s. 9 

of   Arbitration   and   <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_3">Conciliation   Act</a>,   1996   and   prayed   for   appointment   of   local 

commissioner / receiver to take into custody of the asset for which loan facility was 

extended.  This Court vide order dated 17.12.2013, appointed a receiver.  </p><pre id="pre_2">

</pre><p id="p_6"> 4.                         Ld. counsel for the petitioner submits that arbitral award has been passed 

by Ld. Sole Arbitrator namely Mr. Devender Kumar, Chamber No. P­26, Post Office 

Lane, Tis Hazari Court and a request is made for withdrawal of present petition.



</p><p id="p_7">5.                         On the other hand, Ld counsel for respondent challenged the petition on 

the ground of lack of pecuniary jurisdiction of this  court alleging that in arbitration 

proceedings   statement   of   claim   filed   by   petitioner   before   Ld.   Sole   Arbitrator   Sh. 

Devender Kumar, annexed herewith shows that total claim lodged is Rs.5,32,11,646/­ 

(Rupees  Five Crore Thirty Two Lacs Eleven Thousand Six Hundred Forty Six only) 

together with interest till actual realization of claim which would mean that this court has 

no pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain petition under <a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_4">section 9</a> of the Act.



</p><p id="p_8">6.                         Brief   factual   background  of   petition   is   again   narrated   that   the   present 

petition u/s. 9 of the Act was filed by petitioner against the respondent in respect of one 

asset being vehicle / machinery being generator set of particular description which was 

allegedly financed by the petitioner to the respondent under a principal agreement.  In 

this   petition   the   cause   of   action   disclosed   was   in   respect   of   asset   only   for   which 

Rs.9,37,179/­ were extended as loan to the respondent.  This sum / amount being within 

pecuniary jurisdiction of this court, the said petition u/s. 9 of the Act was entertained and 

receiver was appointed as interim measure.

Bajaj Finance Ltd V. Coastal Projects Ltd                                                                   Page no. 3 of 5
 respondent since petitioner has filed statement of claim before the sole arbitrator to the 

tune   of   Rs.5,32,11,646/­   (Rupees   Five   Crore   Thirty   Two   Lacs   Eleven   Thousand   Six 

Hundred   Forty   Six   only)   together   with   interest,   therefore   due   to   lack   of   pecuniary 

jurisdiction this court should return the petition.  Ld counsel for respondent referred to 

<a href="/doc/192913/" id="a_5">Section 42</a> of Act and argued that where with respect to an arbitration agreement any 

application under this has been made in a court, that court alone shall have jurisdiction 

over   the   arbitral   proceedings   and   all   subsequently   applications   arising   out   of   that 

application and the arbitral proceedings shall be made in that court and in no other court. 

It is argued that if the present petition is entertained by this Court subsequently the 

outcome award before the Sole Arbitrator by virtue of <a href="/doc/192913/" id="a_6">section 42</a> of the Act would be 

subject matter of jurisdiction of this court alone,  that arbitral proceedings being of the 

amount of Rs.5,32,11,646/­ (Rupees Five Crore Thirty Two Lacs Eleven Thousand Six 

Hundred Forty Six only) are beyond  pecuniary jurisdiction of this court. 



</p><p id="p_11">8.                         I   have  heard  and   considered   the   entire   facts   and   the   circumstances   of 

petition and it is most important fact that the petitioner Bajaj Finance Limited filed copy 

of award dated 30.10.2014 passed by Ld. Sole Arbitrator Sh. Devender Kumar at Delhi 

wherein petitioner has claimed that it has extended loan facility of total amount of Rs.

5,32,11,646/­ for purchase of construction equipment against each loan account numbers 

respectively by the claimant in a consolidated format.   At the time of filing of present 

petition u/s. 9 of the Act, no such statement of claim was filed before sole arbitrator. The 

facts   and   the   circumstances   of   this   petition   in   hand   has   undergone   a   change   when 

Arbitration no. 1168/13
Bajaj Finance Ltd V. Coastal Projects Ltd                                                                  Page no. 4 of 5
 invoking the arbitral clause the petitioner has chosen to file a  consolidated statement of 

claim of Rs.5,32,11,646/­ (Rupees Five Crore Thirty Two Lacs Eleven Thousand Six 

Hundred Forty Six only) together with interest.   Under these set of circumstances by 

virtue   of   <a href="/doc/192913/" id="a_7">Section   42</a>   of   the   Act   the   argument   of   the   respondent   is   acceptable   that 

individual / separate petitioner u/s. 9 of the Act  in respect of separate items of assets are 

not   maintainable   even   if   each   individual   asset   are   relatable   to   lower   amount   falling 

within the pecuniary jurisdiction of this court.  All these individual assets emanates from 

an agreement between the parties dated 30.01.2013, the details of which are available on 

the statement of claims filed by petitioner.  This court has no pecuniary jurisdiction to 

deal with all subsequent applications emerging from arbitral proceedings.   This court 

does not have jurisdiction to decide this petition u/s. 9 of the Act.  Therefore, taking into 

totality of circumstances, the petition is returned to the petitioner for presentation in 

Court of proper jurisdiction.
