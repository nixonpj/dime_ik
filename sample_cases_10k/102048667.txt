<p id="p_1">     The batch of these petitions are filed for release of the vehicle

seized by the Authorities for contravening provisions of Kerala

Minor Mineral Concession Rules 2015 (hereinafter referred to as

'KMMC Rule' or Kerala Minerals (Prevention of Transportation) Rule

2015 (hereinafter referred to as Transportation Rules).

</p><p id="p_2">     2.    The petitioners in all these writ petitions seek an

opportunity for compounding the offence.

</p><p id="p_3">     3.    The petitioners urge that there must be uniformity in

fixing the compounding fee and they are all prepared to compound

the offence.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     4.    The Rule 111 of the KMMC Rules provides compounding

offence. The offence can be compounded by person authorized to

file a complaint under Rule         110.     Similarly Rule 32 of

Transportation Rules also provides for compounding offence. It is

26577 of 2015                              - : 2 :-

<p id="p_5">also stipulates that the offence can be compounded by an authority

who is authorized to file a complaint before the court in terms of

Sec.22 of Kerala Mines and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_1">Regulation)

Act</a>     1957 <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_2">(MMDR Act</a>) or sub clause (ii) of Rule 2 of the

of any offence punishable under this Act or any rules made

thereunder except upon complaint in writing made by a person

authorised in this behalf by the Central or the State Government.

The State Government issued a notification dated 5.6.2015 (G.O. (P)

</p><p id="p_16">--------------------------------------------------------------------------

</p><p id="p_17">      In view of the above, the only officers referred as above are

alone competent to file a complaint and compound the offence.

</p><p id="p_18">      5.     The question is whether this Court can order release of

the vehicle on payment of compounding fee.                          The learned

Government Pleader relied upon the judgment of this Court in

<a href="/doc/195413490/" id="a_5">Kuriakose v. Sub Inspector of Police</a> [2015 (3) KLT 288] and

submitted that since Rules do not provide for any clear guidelines,

as to how the compounded fee should be determined, the directions

in the above judgment shall be followed. No doubt, judgement of

the above case, may require a consideration by the Government in

the manner in        which compounding fee has to be collected for

compounding the offences.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      7.     However, in view of the notification of the Government

referred as above, the officers authorised to file a complaint to

compound the offence has no less significance in the matter to

W.P.(C).No. 26494, 26540, 26573, 26575, 26576 and
26577 of 2015                      - : 4 :-
</p>
<p id="p_20">exercise discretion for fixing the rate of fee for compounding the

offence. In the above notification, it can be seen that power can be

exercised by the Director/Additional Director/Deputy Directors of

the Mining and Geology/Senior Geologist/Geologist including

District Collector. This Court is of the view that those officers can

take appropriate decision taking into account of the gravity of the

offence of the cases. When primary authority is conferred the power

that authority can decide upon the manner in which compounding

fee can be fixed.      The judicial review is limited to examine the

exercise of the power. It is for the authority to decide what is the

rate that would be applicable in each cases for fixing the

compounding fee, taking into account of the penalty provisions

referred in the Rules.
</p>
<p id="p_21">      In that view of the matter, this writ petition is disposed of by

directing that if the petitioners approach the Geologist of the

Revenue District concerned,           the Geologist shall permit the

petitioners to compound the offence, in accordance with relevant

Rules on payment of the compounding fee fixed by him within one

week from the receipt of the request of compounding being

submitted by the petitioners. The Seizing Authority in each cases

W.P.(C).No. 26494, 26540, 26573, 26575, 26576 and

</p>
<p id="p_22">shall report the matter along with seizure mahazar before the

Geologist within three days. It is made clear that the directions in

this judgment, would be applicable only if the petitioners have

contravened the provisions of the Kerala Mines and Kerala Mines

and Minerals (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_6">Regulation) Act</a>             1957 or

Transportation Rules alone.
