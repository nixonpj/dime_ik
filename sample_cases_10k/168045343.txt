BRIEF REASONS FOR THE DECISION OF THE CASE


</pre><p id="p_1">1. The case of prosecution in brief is that on 17.3.94 at about 6.45 PM at Plot Adjacent house of
   one Rati Ram at Begumpur Delhi within the jurisdiction of PS Sultanpuri accused was found in
   possession of 12 bottles and 240 half bottles of rum in eleven boxes without having any permit
   or license. Accused was booked for commission of offence punishable u/s 61/1/14 of Punjab
   Excise Act. After the registration of the FIR, investigation was carried on.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2. After conclusion of investigation charge sheet              was   filed under even offence.   After
   compliance of <a href="/doc/1613898/" id="a_1">section 207</a> Cr.P.C., charge was framed by Ld. Predecessor of this Court
   against the accused to which accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Accused
   was declared PO on 22.9.01 and was arrested on 13.10.01 and remained in JC upto 8.11.01.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                  1</span>
<p id="p_3"> 3. In support of its case prosecution examined 3 witnesses &amp; PE was ordered to be closed.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4. After conclusion of prosecution evidence statement of accused          was recorded in which
  accused    claimed to be innocent and stated that he has been falsely implicated. Accused
  however, expressed that he does not wish to lead evidence in defence.
</p>

<p id="p_5">5. I have heard the arguments of Ld. APP for the state and the accused and have perused
  the case file carefully. I have also gone through the relevant law and the judgments on the
  issue involved.
</p>

<p id="p_6">6. PW 1 is ASI Mahender Singh was the MHC(M) on 17.3.94 and he has proved the relevant
  entry of register no. 19 Ex. PW1/A vide which case property was deposited in malkhana by HC
  Davinder. He has also proved the RC no. 125/21/94 through which case property was sent to
  Excise Lab.
</p>

<p id="p_7">7. Besides this formal witness prosecution also examined PW2 Ct. Virender Kumar and PW3 ASI
  Devender Kumar, who are the witnesses to the recovery of illicit liquor from the possession of
  the accused and PW3 was also the IO of the present case.
</p>

<p id="p_8">8. In the present case prosecution tried to bring home the guilt of the accused by relying upon the
  version of PW2 &amp; PW3. PW2 &amp; PW3 narrated on the lines of the prosecution version and
  corroborated the version of each other and specifically deposed that accused, who was
  correctly identified by the PWs, was apprehended on the basis of secret information at Plot
  Adjacent house of one Rati Ram at Begumpur Delhi accused was found in possession of 12
  bottles and 240 half bottles of rum in eleven boxes and that case property was sealed with the
  seal of DK and same was seized vide seizure memo Ex. PW2/A, Form M-29 Ex. PW3/A, rukka
  Ex. PW3/B, site plan is Ex. PW3/C, personal search memo Ex. PW2/B.
</p>

<p id="p_9">9. Moreover, even     the version of PW2 &amp; PW3 remained uncorroborated by any other
  independent public witness to the recovery despite the fact that recovery in question took place
  in habited area. The non joining of public witness in such type of cases creates a doubt on the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                2</span>
   story of prosecution as held in the State of Rajasthan Vs. Teja Singh 2001 (II) AD (SC) 125,
  by Hon'ble Supreme Court that :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                        "The failure of the prosecution to examine independent witnesses though
                        available is fatal for their case."</blockquote>


<p id="p_10">               Further in the case title State of Punjab Vs. Gurdyal Singh 1992 (1) RCR Crl. (DB)
646, Roop Chand Vs. State of Haryana 1989 (2) RCR Crl. 504 and State of Punjab Vs. Sukhdev
Singh 1992 (3) RCR Crl. 311, it was held by the Hon'ble Courts that :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                       "where the IO has failed to even note down the names and addresses of
                       the persons, who have refused to join as public witnesses, coupled with
                       the fact that no action was taken against them the,case is rendered
                       doubtful."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_11">12.Further   perusal of the seizure memo reflects that it bears the FIR no. of the present case
  despite the fact that it has been deposed by the      PW3 on oath before the court that seizure
  memo was prepared by him before registration of the case. This further creates doubt on the
  story of the prosecution as observed in case title Pawan Kumar Vs. Delhi Administration, 1988
  (2) RCR 421, wherein Hon'ble Court has observed that :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                       "Where according to the prosecution the recovery memos was prepared
                       before lodging of the FIR, the mention of FIR number in the memos creates
                       doubt about the genuineness of the investigation."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_12">13.Even in the present case the entire investigation has been conducted by the IO who is also
   complainant in the present case which is against the spirit of law as held in :-
</p>

<p id="p_13">    Megha Singh Vs. State of Haryana, 1995 Cr. L.J, 3988, Hon'ble Supreme Court has
  observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                          "we have also noted another disturbing feature in this case. PW 3 Siri
                          Chand, HC arrested the accused and on search being conducted by him
                          a pistol and the cartridges were recovered from the accused. It was on
                          his complaint a formal first information report was lodged and the case
                          was initiated. He being complainant should not have proceeded with the
                          investigation of the case. But it appears to us that he was not only the
                          complainant in the case but he carried on with the investigation and
                          examined witnesses u/s161 Cr. PC. Such practice, to say the least,
                          should not be resorted to so that there may not be any occasion to
                          suspect fair and impartial investigation."
</blockquote>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                 3</span>
<p id="p_14"> 14.Moreover, perusal of file also shows that back bone of this case i.e. seizure memo does not
  even bear signature of the accused. In the absence of the signature of the accused on this
  document it cannot be relied in any manner to connect him with this case.          Absence of
  signature further signifies that it was prepared in the absence of the accused, else IO of this
  case would have definitely obtained signatures.
</p>

<p id="p_15">15.In the present case, sample was deposited in the excise lab after the delay of 1 ½ month

                             <a href="/doc/329579/" id="a_2">BALDEV SINGH vs. STATE OF PUNJAB</a> 1991 Sec (Cr.) 61 that :-
</p>
<p id="p_16">                             In a case where pistol and cartridges were sent after a delay of

                             about 10 days, such delay in sending the crime articles to the

                             lab creates doubt about their connection with the crime.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                             In Ten Singh Vs. State 1996(1) RCR 343 it has been held that
                             Inordinate delay in sending sealed parcel to Forensic Science
                             Lab creates suspicion and throw doubts on the bonafides of
                             the investigation.
</p>

<p id="p_18">16.In view of the aforesaid discussion, I have no hesitation in concluding that prosecution has
  failed to prove its case against the accused. Accused Rajbir @ Rajinder is accordingly stands
  acquitted of the charge U/s 61/1/14 Ex. Act. His bail bond cancelled, surety discharged and
  file be consigned to RR.
