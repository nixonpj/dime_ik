Date

COMMON
ORAL ORDER</pre> 

 

<p id="p_1">1.		In
all these petitions, the amount awarded by the Motor Accident Claims
Tribunal, Kheda at Nadiad is less then Rs.10,000/- and therefore,
instead of filing First Appeals, the present petitions are filed.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_2">2.		The
learned advocate for the petitioners submitted that the learned
Member of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal has followed the
decision of a Hon'ble the Apex Court in the matter of Oriental
Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Nanjappan &amp; Ors.,
reported in 2004 ACJ 721 (Supreme Court), wherein the
Hon'ble the Apex Court was pleased to give direction that Insurance
Company shall pay to the claimants on insured giving a security.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_3">3.		The
learned advocate for the petitioners submitted that this direction
was not in line with the earlier directions issued by the Hon'ble the
Apex Court in the matter of National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs.
Baljit Kaur &amp; Ors.,
reported in 2004 ACJ 428 (Supreme Court), wherein the Hon'ble
the Apex Court was pleased to direct the Insurance Company to pay to
the claimants and allowed Insurance Company to recover the amount
from the insured in the same execution proceedings.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_4">3.1		The
learned advocate for the petitioners also referred to a decision of
the Hon'ble the Apex Court in the matter of United India
Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Suresh K.K. &amp; Ors.,
reported in 2008 ACJ 1741 (Supreme Court),
wherein the Hon'ble the Apex Court followed its earlier decision in
the case of National Insurance Co. Ltd. (supra).
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_5">4.		The
learned advocate for the petitioners submitted that in the present
case, the Insurance Company has already deposited an amount of Rs.18
lacs before the Tribunal.  He submitted that there are other matters
arising from the same accident, in which the amount, being more than
Rs.10,000/-, First Appeal Nos.2145 to 2164 of 2009 are filed and the
same are admitted by this Court (Coram: Hon'ble Mr.Justice
H.K.Rathod) by order dated 13.05.2009.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_6">5.		The
learned advocate for the petitioners submitted that ' insured'
is not contesting or remaining present before the Tribunal and
therefore, no orders for disbursement could be passed, more so
because the learned Member of the Tribunal has taken a view that it
is only after the insured gives security, as directed by the Hon'ble
the Apex Court in the case of Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. (supra),
the Insurance Company can be directed to disburse the amount.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_7">6.		The
Court is unable to appreciate as to why the learned advocate
appearing for the petitioners before the Hon'ble Tribunal is not able
to secure presence of the insured by taking recourse to the remedy
available for the same under the law.  That being so, the present
petitions are not entertained because the counterpart of the learned
advocate for the petitioners is required to take recourse to the
remedy available under the law to secure the presence of the insured.
 The learned advocate for the petitioners may file necessary
application which will be considered by the Tribunal in accordance
with law and once the insured is before the Tribunal, then necessary
orders can be passed in accordance with the directions issued by the
Hon'ble the Apex Court in the matter of Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd.
(supra).
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_8">7.		With
the aforesaid observations, these petitions are dismissed.  Notice is
discharged.  No costs.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_9">		At
the request of the learned advocate for the petitioners and the
learned advocate for respondent No.3, it is clarified that
non-entertainment of these petitions will not prejudice the rights
and contentions of either party in the above referred First Appeals. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_10">		It
is also clarified that non-entertainment of these petitions will not
prejudice the right of the petitioners to secure presence of the
insured and to request the Tribunal to pass orders in accordance with
the directions issued by the Hon'ble the Apex Court in the case of
Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. (supra).
</p>
