                                  JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Petitioner challenges Ext.P1 order of penalty passed under

Section 67 of the KVAT Act for the assessment year 2010-11.

Although statutory remedies are available against Ext.P1,

petitioner has chosen to file this writ petition challenging the order

and the contention raised is mainly relying on Ext.P3, the

assessment order passed against the petitioner for the year 2010-

11 itself.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">2.    According to the learned counsel for the petitioner,                    in

Ext.P3, the total taxable turn over fixed is `15,87,33,655/-

whereas in Ext.P1 penalty order, taxable turn over fixed                      is

`12,10,95,776. It is also their case that in Ext.P3, the balance tax

due has been quantified at `89,54,065 whereas in Ext.P1 penalty

order, tax evaded is estimated at `1,02,25,763. Counsel says that

this inconsistency itself discloses non application of mind in

passing Ext.P1. Yet another contention raised by the counsel for

the petitioner is that the order was passed without affording the

W.P.(C).2975/13
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              2</span>

petitioner a reasonable opportunity to produce their books of

accounts. On this basis, learned counsel for the petitioner seeks

an order for setting aside Ext.P1 and to direct the 1st respondent to

reconsider the matter with notice to them afresh.



</p><p id="p_4">3.    However, both these contentions raised by the learned

counsel for the petitioner are vehemently opposed by the learned

Government Pleader.      According to her, the quantification in

Exts.P1 and P3 is not inconsistent as sought to be made out. It is

also stated that despite various opportunities given, petitioner

neither produced the books of accounts nor even filed any reply to

the proposal served on the petitioner. Therefore according to the

Government Pleader, this writ petition has no merit.



</p><p id="p_5">4.    I have considered the submissions made by both sides.



</p><p id="p_6">5.    Insofar as the case of the petitioner regarding the

inconsistency of the turn over as estimated in Exts.P3 and P1 is

concerned, reading of Ext.P3 shows that the total contract receipt

declared by the petitioner was `16,14,61,034. From this, 25% has

W.P.(C).2975/13
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>

been exempted towards labour and other charges, which is

`4,03,65,258. It is the balance amount which is adopted in Ext.P1

penalty order as the taxable turn over. Secondly, insofar as the

contention that the balance tax due as quantified in Ext.P3 at

`89,54,065 is concerned, it is seen from Ext.P3 order itself that

the total tax including cess has been quantified at `1,73,26,676.

From this, special rebate and input tax credit have been deducted

and      after giving credit to the tax paid, balance has been

quantified at `89,54,065. On the other hand, Ext.P1 order shows

that from out of the total taxable turn over, declared turn over has

been given credit and tax is levied on the turn over that has been

allegedly suppressed. It is on this turn over, tax and cess has

been levied and on that basis, penalty is also quantified. Prima

facie, the figures given in Exts.P3 and P1 do not contain any

inconsistency as sought to be made out.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">6.    Insofar as the alleged lack of opportunity is concerned, it is

stated in Ext.P1 order thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">             "The proposition notice was served on the
             assessee on 21.12.2011. They were also given a

W.P.(C).2975/13
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   4</span>

             chance for personal hearing also in this regard
             on 30.12.2011.     On 30.12.2011 the assessee
             filed a letter requesting one months time to file
             their   reply   and    to   present   their   case.
</p><p id="p_11">             Accordingly time upto 20.1.2012 was given as
             per this office notice dated 2.1.2012.      But on
             20.1.2012 they did not file any reply but
             requested for further time of one week to file the
             reply. Again time up to 27.1.2012 was allowed
             as per this office notice dated 20.1.2012. But
             they did not file any reply or objections to the
             proposal till date. They did not avail any of the
             chances    granted   for   personal    hearing   on
             30.12.2011, 20.1.2012 and 27.1.2012.         In the
             circumstances it is presumed that they have no
             satisfactory reply to file against the proposal. In
             the circumstances the proposal is confirmed and
             the following orders are issued."
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">7.    Reading of the above also shows that the opportunities were

given to the petitioner and the petitioner not only did not produce

the    books of accounts but did not even              file a reply to the

proposal notice served on them. In such circumstances, I am

also unable to agree with the petitioner that there was denial of

any opportunity as alleged. In such circumstances, there is no

reason to entertain this writ petition and if aggrieved, it is for the

petitioner to pursue statutory remedies permissible under the Act.



</p><p id="p_14">8.    Since Ext.P1 order was served on the petitioner only on

31.12.2012 and this writ petition           filed immediately thereafter,

W.P.(C).2975/13
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               5</span>

was pending before this Curt till now, it is ordered that if any

appeal against the said order is filed within ten days from today,

that will be accepted ignoring the delay, in the meanwhile.

</p><p id="p_15">      Writ the above direction, the writ petition is dismissed.
