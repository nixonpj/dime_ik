                             ***

                            ORDER
</pre>


<p id="p_1">      Heard on I.A. No.1/2017 seeking condonation of delay

of 3060 days in preferring the revision petitions.


</p><p id="p_2">      2.    The above Crl.R.P. No.1238/2017 and Crl.R.P.

No.1239/2017 arise out of Crl.A. No.15061/2006 and Crl.A.

No.15062/2006 on the file of the Court of XXXVI Additional

City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru and C.C. No.15/2005

and C.C. No.16/2005 on the file of the V Additional Judge,

Court of Small Causes and XXIV Additional C.M.M., Bengaluru

respectively.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                        3</span><p id="p_3">




</p><p id="p_4">       3.     The Trial Court in the above said cases convicted

the    accused    i.e.,   petitioners        herein     for     the   offences

punishable under Sections 138 r/w. 141 of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_1">N.I. Act</a>, which

was confirmed by the appellate Court by its common

Judgment and Order dated 16.04.2007.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">       4.     Challenging the concurrent findings recorded by

the Courts below thereby convicting and sentencing the

accused/petitioners       for    the       offences     punishable         under

<a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_2">Sections 138</a> r/w. 141 of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_3">N.I. Act</a>, the present revision

petitions have been filed. Since the petitioners are same in

both    the      cases,    the     present       I.A.         filed   by     the

accused/petitioners seeking condonation of delay in both the

cases are heard together and common Order is passed.


</p><p id="p_7">       5.     The learned counsel for the respondent has filed

objections to I.A. No.1/2017.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">       6.     I have perused the affidavit accompanying I.A.

No.1/2017 seeking condonation of delay in preferring the

revision petitions as well as the statement of objections filed

by the respondent.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  4</span><p id="p_10">




</p><p id="p_11">      7.    The learned counsel for the accused/petitioners

would submit that in the appeal preferred before the Sessions

Court, the accused had engaged the services of the learned

Advocate and the accused was informed that his presence

was   not   necessary   before       the   lower   appellate   Court.

Therefore, he was under the impression that the disposal of

the   matter   would    take   some        time    and   the   further

communication would be received from the learned Advocate

who appeared before the appellate Court.                 It is further

submitted that petitioner No.1 was apprehended by the West

Bengal Police in relation to certain affairs of petitioner No.2

firm and petitioner No.1 had to remain in judicial custody

considerably for a long time and he was unable to contact his

Advocate to know about the case. Petitioner No.1 lost sight

of the appeals which were filed before the Sessions Court and

also he was not informed about the status of the appeals by

the learned counsel representing him. He further submitted

that petitioner No.1 was apprehended by the Rajasthan Police

and he had to remain in judicial custody for about 1½ years

and under these circumstances, petitioner No.1 had virtually

lost sight of the appeals preferred by him. He did not make
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               5</span>




any enquiry with regard to the appeals nor he could contact

the advocate with regard to filing of the appeals. During the

second week of October, 2017, the Police were searching for

petitioner No.1 in the homestead when he was away from the

house stating that he has been convicted for the offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_4">Section 138</a> of N.I. Act.       Thereafter, he

made reasonable enquiry and came to know that the appeals

filed by him before the Sessions Court have been dismissed

and issuance of warrant of conviction on the learned

Magistrate.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">     8.       The learned counsel for the petitioners would

submit that immediately after coming to know about disposal

of the appeals, he applied for the certified copy and filed the

present revision petitions without any further lapse of time

and accordingly the learned counsel seeks to condone the

delay in preferring the revision petitions. He places reliance

on the Judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court reported in

(2013)12 SUPREME COURT CASES 649 in the case of

ESHA BHATTACHARJEE VS. MANAGING COMMITTEE OF

RAGHUNATHPUR NAFAR ACADEMY AND OTHERS and

CIVIL APPEAL NOS.5051-5052 OF 2009 IN THE CASE
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 6</span>




OF ESTATE OFFICER, HARYANA URBAN DEVELOPMENT

AUTHORITY &amp; ANR. VS. GOPI CHAND ATREJA, DATED

12.03.2019 and submits that the delay may be condoned for

the aforesaid reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">     On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for

the respondent contended that there is inordinate delay in

preferring the revision petitions and the petitioners have not

shown any sufficient cause to condone the delay. He submits

that there is no bona fide on the part of the petitioners in

preferring the above revision petitions and the revision

petitions have been filed with an oblique motive and to harass

the respondent and to dodge the issue of payment.          The

learned counsel further submits that the reasons assigned by

petitioner No.1 in his affidavit cannot be accepted.       The

criminal appeals filed by the petitioners were dismissed in the

year 2007 and he has not stated when he was apprehended

by the West Bengal Police and also regarding judicial custody

he had undergone. Accordingly, he seeks to dismiss the I.A.

seeking condonation of delay.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  7</span><p id="p_16">




</p><p id="p_17">      9.    These revision petitions are filed with a delay of

3060 days. The revision petitions are against the concurrent

findings recorded by the Courts below, wherein the accused is

convicted for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_5">Section 138</a> of N.I.

Act. The Crl.A. Nos.15061 and 15062/2006 filed by the

accused came to be dismissed on 16.04.2007. These revision

petitions   are   filed   on   29.11.2017.   According   to   the

petitioners, they were under the impression that the disposal

of the appeals before the Sessions Court would take some

time and that they would receive further communication from

the Advocate.     It is further stated that petitioner No.1 was

apprehended by the West Bengal Police in certain cases

relating to the affairs of the petitioner's firm and petitioner

No.1 had to remain in the judicial custody considerably for a

long time. It is further stated that petitioner No.1 was also

apprehended by the Rajasthan Police and he had to remain in

the judicial custody for about 1½ years.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">      10.    Admittedly, the present revision petitions are

filed in the year 2017. The petitioners have not stated as to

when petitioner No.1 was apprehended by the West Bengal

Police and during which period he was apprehended by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  8</span>




Rajasthan Police and remained in judicial custody. The

petitioners have not produced a piece of document to show

that petitioner No.1 was in judicial custody in any of the cases

registered against him and the period for which he was in

judicial custody.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">       11.   It is also stated in the affidavit that the petitioners

had lost sight of the appeals preferred by them and did not

make any enquiry with regard to the appeals nor could

contact their Advocate with regard to filing of the appeals.

This   shows   that   the   petitioners   were   not   diligent   in

prosecuting the appeals and pursuing the cases filed by them.

The reasons stated in the affidavit cannot be construed as

sufficient cause so as to condone an inordinate delay of 3060

days in preferring the revision petitions.


</p><p id="p_22">       12.   The Judgments relied upon by the learned counsel

for the petitioners are not applicable to the facts and

circumstances of the present cases.       Even otherwise, in the

case    of   ESHA      BHATTACHARJEE           VS.     MANAGING

COMMITTEE OF RAGHUNATHPUR NAFAR ACADEMY AND
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  9</span>




OTHERS [Supra] at para 21.10, the Hon'ble Apex Court has

observed that;
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">               "If the explanation offered is concocted or
       the grounds urged in the application are fanciful,
       the courts should be vigilant not to expose the
       other    side   unnecessarily     to   face   such   a
       litigation."</blockquote><p id="p_24">


</p><p id="p_25">       Petitioners have failed to satisfactorily explain the

inordinate     delay   in   preferring    the   revision    petitions.

Accordingly, I.A. No.1/2017 filed seeking condonation of

delay of 3060 days in preferring the revision petitions in the

respective petitions are dismissed. Consequently, the revision

petitions are dismissed.
