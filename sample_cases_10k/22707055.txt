ORAL JUDGMENT</pre>
 

 
<p id="p_1">(PER : HONOURABLE
MR.JUSTICE AKIL KURESHI)
 


 


 
	  


	These
	appeals arise out of a common judgement of conviction and sentence
	recorded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Vadodara, in
	Sessions Case No.36/2008. The accused was charged with offences
	under <a href="/doc/619940/" id="a_1">sections 363</a>, <a href="/doc/796352/" id="a_2">366</a> and <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_3">376</a> of the Indian Penal  Code. He was
	convicted for such offences. For offence under <a href="/doc/619940/" id="a_4">section 363</a>/<a href="/doc/796352/" id="a_5">366</a>, he
	was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years. For
	offence under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_6">section 376</a>, he was sentenced to undergo rigorous
	imprisonment for five years. He was also awarded fine.  Substantive
	sentences were to run concurrently. The accused had thereupon
	preferred Criminal Appeal No.1064/2010 and State has also preferred
	Criminal Appeal No.287/2009 seeking enhancement of the sentence. 
</p>	
	 


	
	  


<p id="p_2">	Briefly
	stated the prosecution version was that the accused had kidnapped
	the minor daughter of the complainant (here-in-after referred to as
	 victim ) aged about 15 years along with her elder sister Jency
	on 2.9.2007. The girls were taken to Pavagadh where three resided
	together for about seven days during which time the accused had
	forcible sexual intercourse with the victim several times. 
</p>	
	 


	
	  


<p id="p_3">	Charge
	were framed at exh.6 in which it was alleged that the accused had on
	2.9.2007 at about 13:30 hours kidnapped the victim and the elder
	sister Jency had accompanied them voluntarily. The accused had
	repeatedly raped the victim thereafter. 
</p>	
	 


	
	  


<p id="p_4">	Complainant,
	Mahendrasinh Balramsinh Rathod, father of the
	victim, PW-1, exh.9, was also the first informant. He deposed that
	on the date of the incident when he and his wife returned from
	service in the evening, they found that the elder two daughters were
	not at home. After inquiring in the locality they had filed a
	missing person report before the police.  Late at night, accused
	Ajay alias Tino called upon and informed him that his daughters were
	with him. A week later the daughters, were found. The victim had
	told her mother that the accused had forcibly taken her to Pavagadh
	where they had stayed in a hotel and raped the victim. He identified
	the accused before the Court. He produced the birth certificate of
	the victim which showed her date of birth as 10.9.1992.
</p>	 


	
	 
		  


<p id="p_5">		In
		the cross examination, he admitted that the victim had refused to
		go to home  and the victim had chosen to go to Nari Sanrakshan Gruh
		since past nine months.
</p>		 


		 
		
	
	  


<p id="p_6">	Jayshreeben
	Mahendrasinh, PW-2, exh.26, the mother of the victim gave a similar
	version and deposed that after being brought back by the police, her
	eldest daughter had come home but the victim had gone to Nari
	Sanrakshan Gruh.
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_7">	Jency
	James Varghese, PW-3, elder sister of the victim was examined at
	exh.27. She deposed that on the date of the incident, the accused
	who resides in the same street had come to their house in the
	afternoon with an auto-rickshaw. He asked them to go with him and
	threatened them that if they did not, he would kill them. They
	thereupon went to Pavagadh by rickshaw where he forcibly performed
	the ceremony of marriage with her sister. They had stayed in a room
	at Pavagadh. This witness thereafter, did not support the
	prosecution and deposed that the accused had not forced himself on
	the victim and no such incident had happened in her presence. She
	was thereupon declared as hostile.
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_8">	The
	victim, PW-4 was examined at exh.29. She stated that she knew the
	accused because he was residing in the same neighbourhood. On the
	date of the incident, at 1 O  clock in the afternoon, he had come
	at the home with a bottle of poison and threatened that if the
	sister did not accompany him, he would commit suicide by consuming
	poison. They had thereupon accompanied him in his rickshaw and gone
	to Pavagadh where they reached at 4 O  clock. Initially by jeep
	and then by foot, they had reached the temple. At six in the evening
	they had come down and gone to place where rickshaw was parked. They
	stayed for a week  in a room at Karchiya near Pavagadh. During this
	time they had  once again gone to Pavagadh and performed marriage
	ceremony and the accused had in the temple tied Mangalsutra to her
	and taken her photographs. They had thereafter, shifted their room
	to another location. During this period, the accused had raped her.
</p>	 


	
	 
		  


<p id="p_9">		In
		the cross examination, she admitted that she and her sister had
		carried their clothes while going with the accused. When they had
		stopped to fill up the petrol in auto-rickshaw, there were many
		people nearby. At many places where they had gone, there were many
		people. All three had stayed in the same room. They had stopped at
		tea stall for tea and snacks. When they had gone to Pavagadh, it
		was very crowded.
</p>		 


		
	
	  


<p id="p_10">	Dr.
</p><p id="p_11">	Ramprakash Ravamswarup Gupta, PW-9, exh.39 had examined the victim.
	She had given history of eloping with accused on 2.9.2007. She had
	not found any marks of injuries on the victim. He admitted that
	according to the victim, she had accompanied the accused
	voluntarily.
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_12">	Dr.
</p><p id="p_13">	Neha Hitendrabhai Seth, PW-11, exh.50 had examined the accused and
	found him capable of  performing sexual intercourse.  This in the
	nutshell is the evidence on record.
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_14">	From
	the evidence on record, it clearly emerges that the accused had
	physical relations with the victim during the time he stayed with
	her for about two weeks around Pavagadh. It is equally true that she
	was below 16 years of age at the time of incident. However, the date
	of birth being 10.9.1992 and the date of incident being of 2.9.2007,
	she was just over 15 years of age. Her birth certificate was
	produced on record at exh.11. We have no reason to discard this
	proof of age of the victim. The defence also has not seriously
	disputed the physical relations between the accused and the victim.
	The main thrust of the defence was of consensual sex. Since the
	victim was below 16 years of age, insofar as offence of rape is
	concerned, her consent was irrelevant. The precise manner in which
	the incident took place must however, have bearing on the quantum of
	punishment.
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_15">	 In
	this context, we may peruse the evidence more closely. There were
	two eyewitnesses to the incident, the victim herself and her sister
	Jency. Though Jency initially supported the prosecution and stated
	before the Court that the accused had forcibly taken them in his
	auto-rickshaw under threat of harm, she did not push the charge of
	forcible intercourse over her sister. On the other hand, the victim
	deposed that the accused had come to their house and forced them to
	accompany him threatening with suicide if they did not do so. On the
	important aspect of what was the nature of force exerted by the
	accused, these two witnesses conflict. According to elder sister, he
	had threatened the girl with bodily harm. According to the victim,
	the younger sister, he had threatened to commit suicide with poison
	which he had brought in a bottle with him. 
</p>	
	 


	
	  


<p id="p_16">	Quite
	apart from these material contradictions, we have perused the
	deposition of victim herself which makes allegations of force quite
	unacceptable. She admitted that they had carried clothes with them
	while accompanying the accused. They had gone on an auto-rickshaw
	which was stopped for filling up petrol at a pump where there were
	many people. They had gone to Pavagadh where after parking the
	auto-rickshaw they had hired a jeep  and from thereafter, one need
	to walk a fair distance to reach the temple. One can take judicial
	notice of the fact that Pavagadh is connected with Vadodara by
	highway and is at a fair distance of about 45 minutes to an hour
	travel time. The victim also agreed that when they had gone to the
	temple it was very crowded. On the way to Pavagadh, they had also
	stopped for tea and snacks, where many people were present. The
	incident took place  between 1 in the afternoon and 6 in the evening
	when the three went from place to place in public view. Even
	thereafter, they stayed together at different places  in the same
	room. It is thus apparent that there was no force, threat or
	coercion exerted by the accused on the two girls to go with him. The
	girls had voluntarily accompanied him obviously because of the
	previous romantic relations between the accused and the victim. The
	fact that the victim after being brought back by the police refused
	to go to her parents and instead chose to stay at Nari Sanrakshan
	Gruh where she was leaving since at-least nine months when the
	deposition of PW-1 was recorded, fortifies this conclusion that we
	have reached.
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_17">	Under
	the circumstances, though we are inclined to confirm the conviction
	for offence under <a href="/doc/619940/" id="a_7">section 363</a>/<a href="/doc/796352/" id="a_8">366</a> and <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_9">376</a> of the IPC, we are
	reluctant to enhance the sentence for the following reasons :
</p>	 


	
	 


<p id="p_18">	1)	Though
	offence of rape was committed  since the victim was below 16 years
	of age, there was no resistance or disinclination on part of the
	victim herself.
</p>	 


	
	 


<p id="p_19">	2)	The
	accused was the sole breadwinner of the family comprising of his
	widowed mother and younger sister.
</p>	 


	
	 


<p id="p_20">	3)	There
	was no previous history of criminal antecedents.
</p>	 


	
	 


<p id="p_21">	4)	We
	are informed he has already served out the full sentence imposed by
	the trial  Court and has already been released from jail.
</p>	 


	
	 


<p id="p_22">	5)	The
	accused comes from a very poor family and lower strata of the
	society.
</p>	 


	
	 


<p id="p_23">	6)	On
	over all consideration of the manner in which the offence took
	place, the background of the accused, and other attendant
	circumstances noted above, in addition to reasons recorded by the
	learned Sessions Judge for awarding sentence of less than seven
	years, we do not find any reason to enhance the same.
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_24">	In
	the result, both the appeals are dismissed.
</p>	 


	
	 

<p id="p_25"> 	R&amp;P
	be returned back to the concerned trial Court.
</p>
