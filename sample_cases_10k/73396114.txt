<p id="p_5">   1.       The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that there
   was a dispute between two groups for control over the Managing
   Committee of Khetadowa SSA U.P. School, West Garo Hills, Meghalaya.
   Initially a committee was constituted by vide order dated 01.02.2018 for a
   period of two years w.e.f. 01.02.2018 to 31.01.2020. On the representation
   of Shri Nurul Amin, Headmaster of the said school dated 01.11.2019, the
   Joint District Mission Co-ordinator, SSA, Dadengre, West Garo Hills in
   partial modification of the order dated 01.02.2018 reconstituted the
   Managing Committee of the said school for a period of two years w.e.f.
   01.02.2018 to 31.01.2020 as per norms laid down in RTE Act 2009 and
   Meghalaya Right to children to free and compulsory education Rules, 2011
   under Section 13. It is contended that the other group led by Shri Soban Ali
   who controlled over the previous Managing Committee filed WP(C) No. 30
   of 2018 before this Court. The said writ petition was disposed of vide order
   dated 09.12.2019 with the observation that the same has been rendered
   infructuous due to efflux of time as the term of the said Managing
   Committee has already expired on 27.11.2019.
</p>
<p id="p_6">   2.       Due to this confusion, the Administrative &amp; Accounts officers, SSA
   West Garo Hills, Tura vide order dated 29.11.2019 has written to the

   WP(C) No. 554 of 2019                                                    Page 1
 Branch Manager, SBI, New Bhaitbari that since the term of the present
School Management Committee of Khetadowa SSA U.P. School has
expired on 27.11.2019, the Account No. 34233340155, SBI, New Bhaitbari
of the school should be withheld with immediate effect until further order
or approval of new School Management Committee whichever is earlier.
</p>

<p id="p_7">3.        When this matter was last listed on 11.12.2019, learned Addl.Sr.GA
Mr. S. Sengupta sought time to study the matter case file of WP(C) No. 30
of 2018 and also to seek instructions. Learned Addl.Sr.GA though has
studied the file but still prays for time to seek instructions.
</p>

<p id="p_8">4.        Considering that due to Bank Account of the petitioner being
frozen, it may not be able to disburse salary of its staff, this matter is being
decided finally.
</p>

<p id="p_9">5.        This Court has examined the file of WP(C) No. 30 of 2018 and the
order impugned therein. In the light of the two orders for constitution of
different Managing Committees, this Court found the disposal of the writ
petition filed by the previous Managing Committee, whose term expired on
27.11.2019, has led to all this confusion. The order constituting the earlier
committee, makes it evidently clear that committee was constituted for a
period of two years w.e.f. 28.11.2017 to 27.11.2019. But the terms of the
reconstituted committee was from 01.02.2018 to 31.01.2020. In these
circumstances, the writ petition is allowed. The impugned order dated
29.11.2019 (Annexure-3) is set aside. However, it is made clear that this
order will entitle the present Managing Committee to operate the Bank
Account only upto 31.01.2020.
</p>

<p id="p_10">4.        The writ petition is disposed of with the aforesaid observations.
