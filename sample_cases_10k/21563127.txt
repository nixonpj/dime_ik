               ---------------------------------------
          Dated this the 11th day of November, 2016

                             JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The petitioner had approached this Court inter alia seeking

for the following reliefs:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                "(i) issue writ of mandamus directing the 1st
          respondent to condone the shortage of attendance
          of the petitioner upto 15%.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                ii) issue a writ of mandamus directing the 1st
          respondent to allow the petitioner to write all the 8
          subjects ini the 3rd semester examination of the
          MBA course.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                iii) issue a writ of mandamus directing the
          respondents to consider the case of the petitioner
          as a special case and issue direction accordingly to
          ensure that the examinations in all the 8 subjects
          are allowed and results are published in the normal
          course of academic year.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                   And
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                iv) to issue such other reliefs as this
          Honourable Court may deem fit and proper in the
          circumstances of this case."</blockquote><p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">     2. The short facts involved in the writ petition disclose that

the petitioner is a student of MBA Programme being conducted by

the 1st respondent. The petitioner had completed his first

semester and is presently in the third semester of the 2nd year

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.C.No.36319 of 2016           2</span>




course. According to the petitioner, he had secured very well in

the 1st and 2nd semester examinations. In respect of the 3rd

semester examination, the petitioner does not have the required

75% attendance in the 8 subjects, but the Principal had

permitted the petitioner to write examination for the 4 subjects

after condoning the shortage of attendance, since the petitioner

had more than 65% of attendance for those subjects. In the

other 4 subjects, the attendance of the petitioner is only less

than 65%. Hence, the Principal could not exercise the discretion

to condone the shortage of attendance.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      3. The petitioner submits that in respect of the aforesaid 4

subjects, the petitioner could not attend the full period of classes,

since the petitioner was laid up on account of an accident. The

deficiency to reach by 65% is either one or two periods and

therefore the College authorities ought to have permitted the

petitioner to write the examination, after condoning the shortage

of attendance.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      4. The learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of

respondents 1 and 2 submits that the College is an autonomous

body and has framed its own regulations in respect of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.C.No.36319 of 2016             3</span>




attendance. As per attendance is concerned, it follows the

procedure adopted by the Indian Institute of Management,

wherein each student will have to get the required attendance in

respect of every subject. The minimum of attendance required for

writing the examination is 75%. As far as the petitioner is

concerned, he did not have the requisite 75% in all the 8

subjects. However, the Principal has the power to condone the

shortage of attendance by 10%. In the present case, in respect of

4 subjects, the petitioner had more than 65% and therefore after

condoning the shortage of attendance he was permitted to write

those examinations. But in respect of the other 4 subjects, since

the attendance is below 65%, even the Principal does not have

the power to condone the shortage of attendance. If such a

method is adopted it will amount to the violation if regulations,

which will affect the credibility of the College as well.

</p><p id="p_6">      5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that this is

a peculiar instance, in which a discretion has to be exercised by

this Court, since it is an admitted fact that the petitioner was

undergoing treatment and the was unavailable to attend the class

on account of the treatment due to the accident. But it is relevant

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.C.No.36319 of 2016            4</span>




to note that when regulations are framed by the College, which is

being followed in the students, those who are deficient in the

attendance, will have to be described as a person, who does not

attend the requisite number of classes, which is necessary for

writing the examination. When regulations are framed by the

College, this Court cannot exercise the discretion and wave the

application of such regulation. In so far as the Principal had

already exercised his discretion in the matter and permitted the

petitioner to write 4 subjects and the Principal does not have the

power to exercise further discretion to condone the shortage of

attendance in respect of the other 4 subjects, I do not think that

it amounts to any illegality, which this Court should interfere and

direct    condonation   of   shortage  of  attendance.     In  such

circumstances, I do not think that the petitioner is entitled for

any of reliefs as prayed for.
