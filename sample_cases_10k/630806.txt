</p>

<p id="p_3">JUDGMENT:
</p>
<p id="p_4">      The  Gudalur Janmam Estates (Abolition and  Conversion
into  Ryotwari)	 Act, 1969 (the Janmam Act), insofar  as  it
vested	forest	lands in the Janmam estates in the State  of
Tamil  Nadu,  was struck down by this Court in <a href="/doc/1126088/" id="a_1">Balmadies  v.
State  of  Tamil Nadu</a> (1973 1 SCR 258) because this was	 not
found  to  be  a  measure of agrarian  reform  protected  by
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_2">Article	 31A</a> of the Constitution.  Section 2(c) of the	West
Bengal Land Holding Revenue Act, 1979 was struck down by the
Calcutta  High	Court  as being	 arbitrary  and,  therefore,
unconstitutional  and  the  special   leave  petition  filed
against	 the  judgment	by  the State  of  West	 Bengal	 was
dismissed.   By	 the Constitution (Thirty fourth  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_3">Amendment)
Act</a>,  the  Janmam Act, in its entirety, was inserted in	 the
Ninth Schedule.	 By the Constitution (Sixty sixth <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_4">Amendment)
Act</a>,  the West Bengal Land Holding Revenue Act, 1979, in its
entirety,  was	inserted  in   the  Ninth  Schedule.   These
insertions  are	 the  subject matter of challenge  in  these
appeals	 and  writ petitions.  The contention is that  these
Acts,  inclusive  of  the portions thereof  which  had	been
struck	down,  could not have been validly inserted  in	 the
Ninth  Schedule.   It  rests on two  counts:   (1)  Judicial
review is a basic feature of the Constitution;	to insert in
the  Ninth Schedule an Act which, or part of which, has been
struck	down as unconstitutional in exercise of the power of
judicial  review is to destroy or damage the basic structure
of  the Constitution.  (2) To insert into the Ninth Schedule
after  24th April, 1973, an Act which, or part of which, has
been  struck  down  as being violative	of  the	 fundamental
rights	conferred  by  Part-III of the	Constitution  is  to
destroy or damage its basic structure.	<a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_5">Article 31B</a> provides
:   31B.   Validation  of certain  Acts	 and  Regulations.-
Without	 prejudice  to	the  generality	 of  the  provisions
contained  in <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_6">article 31A</a>, none of the Acts and	 Regulations
specified  in  the Ninth Schedule nor any of the  provisions
thereof	 shall be deemed to be void, or ever to have  become
void,  on the ground that such Act, Regulation or  provision
is  inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of	 the
rights	conferred  by,	any  provisions of  this  Part,	 and
notwithstanding	 any judgment, decree or order of any  court
or  tribunal  to  the contrary, each of the  said  Acts	 and
Regulations  shall,  subject to the power of  any  competent
Legislature to repeal or amend it, continue in force.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      The  judgment of a Constitution Bench of this Court in
Waman  Rao  &amp; Ors.  etc.  etc.	v.  Union of India and	Ors.
(1981  2 SCR 1) dealt with <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_7">Article 31B.</a>	 It referred to	 the
judgment  of  this Court in the case of	 Kesavananda  Bharti
(1973  Suppl.  SCR 1), decided on 24th April, 1973, where it
was  held  by the majority that Parliament has no power	 to
amend  the Constitution so as to damage or destroy its basic
or  essential features or its basic structure. The order in
Waman Raos case was that all amendments to the Constitution
which  were  made before 24th April, 1973 and by  which	 the
Ninth  Schedule	 was  amended  from  time  to  time  by	 the
inclusion  of  various	Acts and Regulations  therein,	were
valid  and  constitutional.  Amendments to the	Constitution
made  on  or  after  24th April, 1973  by  which  the  Ninth
Schedule  was amended from time to time by the inclusion  of
various Acts and Regulations therein were open to challenge
on  the	 ground	 that they, or any one or more of  them	 are
beyond	the  constituent power of the Parliament since	they
damage	the basic and essential features of the Constitution
or  its	 basic structure. The order in Waman Rao  did  not
pronounce   upon   the	  validity    of   such	  subsequent
constitutional	amendments except to say that if any Act  or
Regulation   included	in   the   Ninth   Schedule   by   a
constitutional	amendment made after April 24, 1973 is saved
by  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_8">Article 31A</a>, or by <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_9">Article 31C</a> as it stood prior to	 its
amendment  by  the forty second amendment, the challenge  to
the  validity  of the relevant Constitutional  Amendment  by
which that Act or Regulation is put in the Ninth Schedule on
the ground that the amendment damages or destroys a basic or
essential feature of the Constitution or its basic structure
as  reflected in Articles 14, 19 or 31, will become otiose.
Chandrachud,  C.J., in his judgment in Waman Rao, said	that
laws and regulations included in the Ninth Schedule prior to
24th  April,  1973  will not be open to	 challenge  on	the
ground	that  they  are inconsistent with or  take  away  or
abridge any of the rights conferred by any of the provisions
of Part III of the Constitution.  Acts and Regulations which
are  or	 will be included in the Ninth Schedule on or  after
April  24,  1973 will not receive the protection of  <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_10">Article
31B</a> for the plain reason that in the face of the judgment in
Kesavanand  Bharti  (supra) there was no  justification	 for
making	additions  to  the  Ninth Schedule with	 a  view  to
conferring  a  blanket	protection  on	the  laws   included
therein.   The	various constitutional amendments  by  which
additions  were made to the Ninth Schedule on or after April
24, 1973 will be valid only if they do not damage or destroy
the  basic  structure  of the Constitution.   Bhagwati,	 J.
delivered a judgment that is common to Waman Rao and Minerva
Mills  Ltd.  &amp; Ors.  v.	 Union of India &amp; Ors.	(1981 1	 SCR
</p><p id="p_6">206).	He  said  that all constitutional  amendments  made
after  the decision in Keshavananda Bhartis case would have
to  be tested by reference to the basic structure  doctrine,
for  Parliament would then have no excuse for saying that it
did  not  know the limitation on its amending  powers.	 He
added  that in every case where a constitutional  amendment
includes  a  statute or statutes in the Ninth Schedule,	 its
constitutional	validity  would	 have to  be  considered  by
reference   to	the  basic   structure	doctrine  and	such
constitutional	amendment  would  be liable to	be  declared
invalid	 to  the extent to which it damages or destroys	 the
basic  structure of the Constitution by according protection
against violation of any particular fundamental right.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      The  judgment in Waman Rao needs to be considered by a
larger	Bench  so that the apparent inconsistencies  therein
are  reconciled	 and  it  is made clear whether	 an  Act  or
Regulation  which, or a part of which, is or has been  found
by  this  Court	 to  be	 violative of one  or  more  of	 the
fundamental  rights conferred by Articles 14, 19 and 31	 can
be  included  in the Ninth Schedule or whether it is only  a
constitutional	amendment  amending the Ninth Schedule	that
damages	 or destroys the basic structure of the Constitution
that can be struck down.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      The Constitution Bench that had decided Waman Rao also
decided	 the  case of Maharao Sahib Sri Bhim Singh  Ji	Etc.
Etc.  v.  Union of India &amp; Ors.	 Etc.  Etc.  (1985 Suppl.  1
SCR 862).  The Urban Land (Ceiling and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_11">Regulation) Act</a>, 1976
was  the  subject  matter  of the  decision.   It  had	been
inserted  into	the  Ninth Schedule by	the  Constitution  (
Fortieth  Amendment) Act.  Tulzapurkar, J.  held the  entire
Act  to be unconstitutional.  The other four learned  Judges
agreed	with him to the extent that a part of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_12">Section  27(1)</a>
of the Act was unconstitutional.  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_13">Section 27(1)</a> read thus:
</p>
<p id="p_9">      27(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other
law  for  the  time  being  in force,  but  subject  to	 the
provisions  of sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/758150/" id="a_14">section 5</a> and	 sub-section
(4)  of <a href="/doc/919618/" id="a_15">section 10</a>, no person shall transfer by way of sale,
mortgage,  gift, lease for a period exceeding ten years,  or
otherwise,  any	 urban or urbanisable land with	 a  building
(whether  constructed  before or after the  commencement  of
this Act) or a portion only of such building for a period of
ten years of such commencement or from the date on which the
building is constructed, whichever is later, except with the
previous permission in writing of the competent authority.
</p>

<p id="p_10">      Tulzapurkar,  J., Krishna Iyer, J.  and A.P.  Sen,  J.
delivered  separate judgments.	Chandrachud, C.J., on behalf
of  himself and Bhagwati, J., stated that they would deliver
a detailed judgment later;  but, later, they passed an order
stating	 that they had gone through the judgment of  Krishna
Iyer,  J.  and found that there was nothing that they  could
usefully  add  to it.  Tulzapurkar, J.	struck down  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_16">Section
27(1)</a>  for the reason that it did not adequately control the
arbitrary  exercise  of	 the power to grant  or	 refuse	 the
permission.   The provision was found by him to be violative
of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_17">Article 14</a> and was, therefore, struck down as being ultra
vires  and  unconstitutional.  A.P.  Sen, J.  took the	view
that  there  was  no  justification   for  the	freezing  of
transactions  by  way  of sale, mortgage, gift or  lease  of
vacant	land  or building for a period exceeding  ten  years
even  though  such land, with or without  building  thereon,
fell  within the ceiling limits.  The right to acquire, hold
and  dispose  of  property  guaranteed to  a  citizen  under
<a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_18">Article	 19(1)(f)</a> carried with it the right not to hold	 any
property.   It	was  difficult to appreciate how  a  citizen
could  be  compelled to own property against his  will.	  If
vacant land owned by a person fell within the ceiling limits
for  an	 urban agglomeration, he was outside the purview  of
the  Act and could not be governed by any of the  provisions
of  the	 Act.  It was, therefore held by the  learned  Judge
that the provisions of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_19">Section 27(1)</a> were invalid insofar as
they  sought  to affect a citizens right to dispose of	his
urban  property in an urban agglomeration within the ceiling
limits.	 Krishna Iyer, J.  did not discuss the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_20">Section	 27(1)</a>, but he agreed with the learned Chief Justice
regarding  the partial invalidation of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_21">Section 27(1)</a>.  The
learned	 Chief	Justice had said in his brief earlier  order
that  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_22">Section  27(1)</a>  was invalid insofar as  it  imposed  a
restriction  on	 the  transfer of any urban  or	 urbanisable
property  within  the  ceiling	 area.	 Such  property	 was
transferable  without  the constraints mentioned in  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_23">Section
27(1)</a>.	 What  is relevant is that whereas  Tulzapurkar,  J.
and  A.P.Sen,  J.  struck down <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_24">Section 27(1)</a>, in  part,	 for
violation of the fundamental rights conferred by Articles 14
and  19(1)(f)  respectively, without more, Krishna Iyer,  J.
said:	What  is a betrayal of the basic feature is  not  a
mere  violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_25">Article 14</a> but a shocking, unconscienable
or  unscrupulous  travesty  of	the  quintessence  of  equal
justice.   If  a legislation does go that far it shakes	 the
democratic foundation and must suffer the death penalty.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      The  decision in Bhim Singh Ji case will also have  to
be  considered	by  the	 larger Bench for  the	purposes  of
arriving at the conclusion aforementioned.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      We  deem	it  fit, accordingly, to  refer	 these	writ
petitions  and	appeals	 for  decision to  a  larger  Bench,
preferably   of	 nine  learned	 Judges.   The	papers	 and
proceedings  shall  be placed before the Honble	 the  Chief
Justice of India for appropriate orders.
