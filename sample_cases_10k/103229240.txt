HONBLE SRI JUSTICE U.DURGA PRASAD RAO          

CRIMINAL PETITION No.11316 of 2017    

ORDER:  
</pre><p id="p_1">        This petition is filed by the petitioners/A1 and A2 under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section
482</a> Cr.P.C seeking to quash the proceedings against them in
C.C.No.394 of 2017 on the file of I Additional Judicial First Class
Magistrate, Nizamabad registered for the offences under <a href="/doc/105503/" id="a_2">Sections 417</a>,
<a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_3">420</a> and <a href="/doc/513074/" id="a_4">109</a> IPC. 
</p><p id="p_2">2)       Brief facts of the case are that complainant was working as
Computer Operator at TVS Show room Nizamabad. Whileso, on     
18.04.2017 the caste elders of complainant approached A1 who was  
working as MEO of Kalther Mandal and settled the marriage of
complainant with A1 and engagement was also performed as per their 
caste tradition. Thereafter, on 21.04.2017 when the caste elders went to
Madwar Thanda where A1 is residing for fixing the marriage date, A1
with the connivance of his uncleA2 expressed his unwillingness to
marry the complainant, quarreled and abused them in filthy language.
Basing on the said complaint, the police of Nizamabad II Town PS
registered a case in Cr.No.46 of 2017 under <a href="/doc/105503/" id="a_5">Sections 417</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_6">420</a> and <a href="/doc/513074/" id="a_7">109</a>
IPC and after investigation laid charge sheet and case was registered as
C.C.No.394 of 2017 on the file of I Additional Judicial First Class
Magistrate, Nizamabad. 
</p><pre id="pre_2">3)       Heard.
4)      Seeking quashment of proceedings, learned counsel for
</pre><p id="p_3">petitioners/A1 and A2 would submit complaint allegations do not show
any inducement made by the petitioners to constitute the offence under
<a href="/doc/1306824/" id="a_8">Section 415</a> IPC. He submits that in case of cheating the intention to
cheat must be in existence from inception which is lacking in the present
case and mere making promise and subsequent failure to keep the same  
does not amount to cheating. He would also submit that it is not the case
of complainant that on the false promise of marriage, either the petitioner
induced the complainant to have sexual intercourse with him or
demanded and obtained any dowry or valuable articles from her family
members. He thus submitted that a false case is foisted against the
petitioners and if it is allowed to continue, it would amount to abuse of
process of law. On this aspect he relied upon the decision of this Court
reported in <a href="/doc/61551315/" id="a_9">M.Giriprasad v. K.Munikrishna Reddy</a> . He thus prayed to
allow the petition.
</p><p id="p_4">5)      Learned Additional Public Prosecutor opposed the petition and
stated as the matter is coming up for framing of charges, the petition may
be dismissed. 
</p><p id="p_5">6)      On perusal of the FIR, charge sheet and the statements of the
witnesses, this Court finds force in the contention of the petitioners. It is
not the case of complainant that on the false pretext of marriage, the 1st
petitioner/A1 has either induced her to have sexual intercourse with him
or obtained dowry and other paraphernalia from her parents. In that
view, even if the compliant allegations are true, mere failure to keep up
the promise will not come within the ambit of cheating.
</p><p id="p_6">7)      In similar circumstances, in M.Giriprasads case (1 supra), this
Court held thus:
</p><p id="p_7">Para-5: The complaint does not show any inducement made by   
the petitioners for presenting the gold ornaments to A1. The
complaint only shows that both parties agreed for the marriage
of LW3-Thulasi and A1 and the engagement function took place 
on 10.06.2012. Therefore, from the facts, it can be understood
that basing on the promise made by the petitioners, the de facto
complainant celebrated the engagement function and also spent 
some amount under the impression that his daughter's marriage
will be performed with A1. Subsequently, for the reasons best
known to him, A1 did not agree to marry LW 3-Thulasi, the
daughter of the de facto complainant.
</p><p id="p_8">Para-6: I am of the considered view that the act complained of
would not attract any criminal offence. Letdown from a promise
to marry does not in any way attract the offence under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_10">Section
420</a> of IPC. Further, merely because A1 received some gold
ornaments presented by the de facto complainant it does not
constitute an offence of criminal breach of trust. It appears from
the complaint allegations that the de-facto complainant incurred
some expenditure under the impression that his daughter's
marriage would be performed with A1 on a date agreed upon by 
both parties. Subsequently, however, as A1 was not willing to
marry LW3-Thulasi, the daughter of the de facto complainant,
the marriage could not be performed. The de facto complainant
since acted on the promise made by the petitioners, more
particularly, that of A1, if he had really incurred any expenditure
based on the assurance of the petitioners, he can recover the
same by way of damages which remedy lies in civil law. I do not
think any criminal offence is made out against the petitioners
warranting prosecution against them.
</p><p id="p_9">8)      It is needless to emphasize the case on hand, stands on the same
footing. Therefore, the continuation of criminal proceedings as argued,
would amount to abuse of process of the Court.
</p><p id="p_10">9)      Accordingly Criminal Petition is allowed and proceedings in
C.C.No.394 of 2017 on the file of I Additional Judicial First Class
Magistrate, Nizamabad are quashed against petitioners/A1 and A2. 
</p><p id="p_11">     As a sequel, miscellaneous petitions pending, if any, shall stand
closed.
