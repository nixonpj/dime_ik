                     ------------------------------

         Dated this the 26th day of November, 2009


                         J U D G M E N T
</pre><p id="p_1">                         ----------------------
</p>
<p id="p_2">     1.    Heard counsel for the petitioners and standing

counsel for 6th respondent Bank. In view of the fact that I am not

entering upon any findings regarding merits of the case and in

view of the fact that the relief proposed to be granted is only a

direction to the 8th respondent for disposal of the matter on an

early basis, notice is not issued to respondents 1 to 5.

</p><p id="p_3">     2.    Grievance of the petitioners is that a securitization

application filed under Section 17(1) of the Securitisation and

Reconstruction of Financial Assets and <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_1">Enforcement of Security

Interest Act</a>, 2002 <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_2">(SARFAESI Act</a>) along with many other

interlocutory applications filed therein are not being considered

and disposed of by the 8th respondent Tribunal, ignoring the

mandatory requirement under <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_3">Section 17(5)</a> to dispose of such

applications within a maximum period of 4 months.

</p><p id="p_4">     3.    Immovable property belonging to the petitioners was

mortgaged for securing a loan availed by the 1st respondent

concern, which is owned by the respondents 2 and 3, who are

the son and daughter-in-law of the petitioners. Consequent to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C).34118/09-H                2</span>


default committed in repayment the 6th respondent initiated

proceedings under the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_4">SARFAESI Act</a> and took over possession

of the property in question, under <a href="/doc/26129616/" id="a_5">Section 13(4)</a> of the SARFAESI

Act. At that stage, on 4.2.2008, S.A.No:17/2008 was filed by the

petitioners and respondents 1 to 3, before the 8th respondent.

Subsequently when sale of the properties were proclaimed,

I.A.No:1546/08 was filed seeking stay of the sale proceedings.

Eventhough I.A.No:1545/08 was filed seeking an urgent hearing

of the matter, the stay petition was adjourned on several

occasions, without passing any orders thereon. Consequently

the properties in question were sold in public auction on

29.10.2008. Thereafter I.A.No:1697/08 was filed seeking to set

aside the sale, after impleading the auction purchaser. But the

said application was also not disposed of by the Tribunal and

adjourned from time to time along with the main petition.

Thereafter the property in question was handed over to the

auction purchaser and when he attempted to demolish the

building, the petitioner again filed I.A.No:1937/08. No orders

was issued in the said application also. It is further stated that

the auction purchaser had already sold a portion of the property

to the 5th respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      4.    It is stated that the securitisation application and all

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C).34118/09-H                3</span>


the above said interlocutory applications are being repeatedly

adjourned and the 8th respondent Tribunal is not disposing of

those applications expeditiously. It is further submitted that the

matter now stands posted to 2.12.2009.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      5.    As per <a href="/doc/70231376/" id="a_6">Section 17(5)</a> of the SARFAESI Act, an

application made under <a href="/doc/141981259/" id="a_7">Section 17(1)</a> should be disposed of as

expeditiously as possible, within 60 days from the date of such

application.     But the Tribunal can extend disposal of such

application from time to time for specific reason to be recorded

in writing. However, the proviso to <a href="/doc/70231376/" id="a_8">Section 17(5)</a> makes it clear

that the period of pendency of such application shall not extend

beyond 4 months from the date of filing. In this case it is evident

that the securitisation application was filed as early as on

4.2.2008. Subsequently many other interlocutory applications

were also filed in the matter.          The non-disposal of the

applications as well as the interim petitions is causing much

prejudice to the petitioner, is the contention.

</p><p id="p_7">      6.    It is noticed that as per <a href="/doc/112083210/" id="a_9">Section 17(6)</a> of the

SARFAESI Act if the applications are not disposed of by the Debt

Recovery Tribunal within a period of 4 months, the party has got

a remedy by way of application to be submitted to the appellate

Tribunal seeking expeditious disposal of the matter. But in this

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C).34118/09-H                4</span>


case it is noticed that there is inordinate delay. It is also noticed

that the petitioners are senior citizens aged 90 years and 80

years respectively. It is further noticed that there is no regular

sitting in the Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal having

jurisdiction in the matter, since no presiding officer is posted to

that Tribunal. Considering all the above situation I am of the

opinion that it is only just and proper in the interest of justice to

issue necessary directions for an early disposal of the matter by

the 8th respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      7.    In the result the writ petition is disposed of directing

8th respondent to consider S.A.No:17/08 along with the

accompanying I.As and to dispose of the same, as far as possible

on the next posting date itself, and if not possible to dispose of

the same at the earliest, at any rate, within a period of one

month thereafter.
