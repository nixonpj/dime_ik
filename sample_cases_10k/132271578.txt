                                          ORAL ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1">         1.       The petitioners who were the original plaintiffs in the Civil Suit
         No.57 of 2001 and against whom action for perjury by filing of
         complaint is ordered by learned 4th Additional Senior Civil Judge vide
         order dated 29.05.2017 have come before this Court by present
         petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution challenging the said
         order.
</p>

<p id="p_2">         2.       It appears that the original defendants No.5 and 6 had filed
         application on 22.09.2009 alleging the forgery of their signatures on
         Vakalatnama, the injunction application and other documents which
         were made part of the said suit and praying to take action against the
         petitioners for perjury. Pursuant to such application, the Court below
         ordered to send the concerned documents to the Forensic Laboratory
         for expert's opinion and on receipt of the report as regards the false
         signatures on Vakalatnama and other documents, the impugned
         order came to be made whereunder, the application filed by
         defendants No.5 and 6 at Exh.168 is accepted and the Registrar of
         the Court is ordered to lodge complaint of perjury.
</p>

<p id="p_3">         3.       Learned advocate Mr.Parikh for the petitioners submitted that
         when the suit was under the old number, the police had held an
         inquiry in connection with the complaint made by defendants No.5
         and 6 and on inquiry, the police made report finding no offence
         committed by the petitioners. Mr.Parikh submitted that after suit was

                   C/SCA/17849/2017                                                ORDER



         given new number in the year 2015, summons / notice appears to
         have been issued in the suit and the suit with new number does not
         show any inquiry made by the Court below as regards the allegations
         of perjury. Mr.Parikh submitted that in fact there is no question of
         forgery of signatures on document as the parties were negotiating for
         resolving the dispute in connection with the suit property and in fact
         neither any loss is caused to defendants No.5 and 6 nor any
         monetary gain is taken by the petitioners on the basis of any
         documents stated to have been falsely made or presented with the
         forged signatures in the proceedings of the Court.
</p>

<p id="p_4">         4.    The Court, having heard learned advocate Mr.Parikh, finds that
         the old suit of 2001 was given new number as Regular Civil Suit
         No.774 of 2015. Learned advocate Mr.Parikh could not dispute that
         on increase in the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Court, such new
         number was given to old Civil Suit No.57 of 2001. Before new number
         was given, defendants No.5 and 6 had filed application alleging
         forgery of signatures on Vakalatnama and other documents and for
         taking action against the petitioners for perjury in connection with the
         documents in the custody of the Court. It appears from the impugned
         order that the Court on consideration of the report of Director of
         Forensic Science found that there are strong reasons for taking action
         for perjury against the petitioners. Thus, based on report of the
         Forensic Laboratory, the impugned order is made directing the
         Registrar of the Court to file complaint against the petitioners for the
         offence of perjury. The Court finds that when the impugned order is
         made on the basis of the report of the Director of Forensic
         Laboratory, no interference is required by this Court in the impugned
         order in the exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_2">Article 227</a> of the Constitution.
         As and when the complaint is lodged and the proceedings for perjury
         is taken, it is always open to the petitioners to take all defences
         available in law. In such view of the matter, the petition deserves to
         be rejected. It is accordingly, rejected.
