              Dated this the 19th day of June, 2008.

                               JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Ravindran, J:
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      The petitioner in W.P.(C).No.5762 of 2004 is the appellant.

The appellant was working as the Central Nazir of the District

Court, Kollam during the period      from 3.3.1994 to 28.3.1996.         A

notice issued by the Hon'ble the Supreme Court of India to the third

respondent in C.A.No.2686 of 1989 was forwarded by this Court for

service on that respondent to the District Court, Kollam                on

17.11.1995. The appellant received the said notice on 24.11.1995.

Since the notice     was not returned to this Court after service, a

letter was sent from this Court on 31.1.1997.       Thereafter the notice

was traced out and served. The appellant's explanation was sought

by the District Judge.     In his explanation the appellant admitted

having received the notice issued by the Apex Court. He, however,

took the stand that he had entrusted the notice with the Amin on

duty   for entering the details in the A register and that the Amin

misplaced the notice. As the reply submitted by the appellant was

not satisfactory, the District Judge, Kollam initiated         disciplinary

WA.NO.1141/08                                                       .

proceedings against him.      Sri.K.George Oomen, the Additional Sub

Judge, was appointed as the enquiry authority.          The enquiry

authority issued Ext.P1 memo of charges dated 2.2.1998.          The

appellant   submitted his    written statement    of   defense   and

participated in the enquiry. The report of the enquiry authority is

evidenced by Ext.P2. In Ext.P2 the enquiry authority found that the

appellant who received the      notice issued by the Apex Court on

24.11.1995 did not take any follow up action. The appellant was

found guilty of the charge levelled against him. Thereafter by Ext.P3

order dated 18.3. 1999 the District Judge, Kollam/the disciplinary

authority imposed on the appellant the punishment of withholding of

increments for three years with cumulative effect.      The appellant

submitted an appeal     to this Court.   By Ext.P4 order  passed on

27.7.2001 the said appeal was dismissed. The appellant thereupon

filed the writ petition challenging Exts.P3 and P4.    By judgment

delivered on 26.11.2007 the learned Single Judge dismissed the writ

petition. Hence, this appeal.

</p><p id="p_6">2.    We have heard Sri.S. Sanal Kumar,         the learned  counsel

appearing for the appellant. it is evident from the findings of the

enquiry authority that there was a grave dereliction of duty on the

WA.NO.1141/08                                                          .

part of the appellant in the discharge of his duty. It has been proved

in the enquiry that the appellant's case that had entrusted the notice

with the Amin is incorrect.   It has come out in the enquiry that no

entry was made in the A register by the appellant           though he

admitted having received the notice on 24.11.1995.        The evidence

adduced in the enquiry conclusively establishes that the appellant

who had admittedly received the notice issued by the Apex Court in

C.A.No.2686 of 1989 did not take steps to have the notice served

on the    3rd  respondent   therein.     Considering the   punishment

awarded by the disciplinary authority    and the order passed in the

appeal by this Court, we are satisfied that no grounds have been

made out warranting interference     with the decision of the learned

Single Judge.    From the materials on records, it is not possible to

hold that the finding of the enquiry authority/disciplinary authority is

in any way perverse.
