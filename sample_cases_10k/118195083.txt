               (NITESH PATEL Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)


04-11-2015


     Shri Sharad Verma, counsel for the applicants Nitesh Patel
and Devendra Kumar Patel.
     Shri Arun Paroha, counsel for the applicant Rakesh Patel.
     Shri Ajay Tamrakar, Panel Lawyer for the respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Heard learned counsel for the parties.
</p><p id="p_2">     Since all the applications are connected with the same
crime number therefore, hereby decided by the present common
order.
</p><p id="p_3">     The applicants Nitesh and Devendra Kumar Patel are in
custody since 8/4/2015 whereas, applicant Rakesh Patel is in
custody since 6.5.2015 relating to Crime No.174/2015 registered
at Police Station Damoh Dehat, District Damoh for offence
punishable under <a href="/doc/764237/" id="a_1">Section 394</a> of I.P.C.
</p><p id="p_4">     Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the
applicants are in the age group of 21 to 23 years of age. Initially
they were identified by the complainant in the test identification
parade. However, at present the complainant Chandrabhan
(PW1) has been examined, who did not confirm the test
identification parade. He could not identify the applicants in the
Court. It is alleged against the accused Nitesh that a sum of
Rs.4000/- and a rod was recovered from him. It is alleged against
Devendra that a sum of Rs.4500/- was recovered from him.
However, such recovered articles are not identifiable and
therefore, by such recovery Nitesh and Devendra Kumar Patel
cannot be connected with the crime. A sum of Rs.4500/-, one rod
 and one bag and prescription etc. were recovered from the
applicant Rakesh Patel. However, there was no utility to Rakesh
to keep such prescription and bag. It appears that such articles
were obtained by the Police from the complainant to implicate
the applicants in the crime. Chain of circumstantial evidence
against these applicants is broken. They are in custody without
any substantial reason. Under these changed circumstances,
they pray for bail.
</p><p id="p_5">      Learned Panel Lawyer opposes the application.
      Considering the submissions made by learned counsel for the
parties, looking to the facts and circumstances of the case including
the gravity of offence, without expressing any view on the merits of the
case, I am of the view that application under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_2">Section 439</a> of Cr.P.C.
filed by the applicants viz. Nitesh Patel, Devendra Kumar Patel and
Rakesh Patel may be accepted. Consequently it is hereby allowed.
It is directed that present applicants be released on bail on their
furnishing a bond in sum of Rs.40,000/- (Rupees forty thousand)
each with one surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of
the trial Court to appear before the trial Court on the dates given by
the concerned Court.
</p><p id="p_6">This order shall be effective till the end of trial but in case of bail jump,
it shall become ineffective.
</p><p id="p_7">      Certified copy as per rules.
</p>



<p id="p_8">                                                           (N.K. GUPTA)
