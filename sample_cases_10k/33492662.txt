P. C. :


.           This writ petition challenges an order of interim mesne profits
</pre><p id="p_1">passed by the Appellate Bench of Court of Small Causes at Mumbai,
Bandra Branch. The Respondent herein is the original Plaintiff. By a
decree passed in his favour by the Court of Small Causes at Mumbai,
Bandra Branch in R.A.E. Suit No.138 of 2007, the Respondent's suit
was decreed and the Petitioners (original defendants) were directed to
hand over possession of the suit premises to the Respondent.                       That
order was challenged by the Petitioners before the Appellate Bench of
the Court of Small Causes at Mumbai.            The Appellate Bench            had to
fix interim compensation payable for use of the suit premises during
the pendency of the appeal.            By the impugned order, the Appellate

 Chittewan                                  2/2                                 27. WP 674-19.doc



Bench fixed a                sum of Rs.15,000/- per month as an interim
compensation during the pendency of the appeal.                   The suit premises
consists of a flat situated on CTS No.728/4 on the Ground Floor,
"Sheela Sadan" situated at Ceasor Road, Amboli, Andheri (West),
Mumbai-400 058.               The parties had submitted their valuation reports
for fixation of compensation for the suit premises. The Petitioners'
report proposed reasonable compensation of Rs.5,000/- per month as
against Rs.48,000/- per month proposed by the Respondent.                           In the
impugned order, the Appellate Court rejected compensations indicated
in both reports. The Court was of the view that the carpet area as
well as amenities considered considered in both reports were different
and neither of the valuations could be relied upon.                         The Court
estimated an in-between figure of compensation at the rate of
Rs.15,000/- per month as reasonable.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2            Considering the suit premises, its location and amenities, it
cannot be said that the compensation fixed by the Appellate Bench is
either disproportionately high or is unreasonable or perverse. It is only
an          interim   compensation,     which    is   anyway     subject       to      final
determination by the Court.            No infirmity can be found, accordingly,
with the impugned order dated 8 October 2018 within the parameters
of judicial review under Articles 226 or 227 of the Constitution.                       The
writ petition is dismissed. No order as to costs.
