</p>
<p id="p_2">2.     Pursuant to an application for early hearing, the writ petition is being

</p>
<p id="p_5">4.     Petitioner claims to be a senior citizen of about 77 years of age. On
       05.01.1968, the petitioner was appointed as Junior Engineer in the
       Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the petitioner was promoted
       from time to time.      The petitioner was promoted to the post of
       „Executive Engineer‟ on 04.07.1983. A chargesheet was issued to the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P. (C) 7594/2009                                                  Page 1 of 9</span>
        petitioner on 25.07.1996 initiating disciplinary proceedings against
       him.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.     During the pendency of the disciplinary proceeding, a DPC was held
       on 26.07.1996 for the post of „Superintending Engineer (Civil)‟. The
       petitioner was found eligible and selected, but his name was placed in
       a sealed cover. In September, 1996, the petitioner approached this
       court by filing a writ petition, being W.P. (C) 2943/1996, challenging
       the issuance of the chargesheet inter alia on the ground of delay. By
       an order of 22.05.1998, a Single Judge of this court quashed the
       chargesheet and directed the DDA/respondent no. 3 to open the seal
       cover and pass an order as per the recommendations of the DPC.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.     The DDA preferred an LPA (LPA 39/1999) by the respondent DDA,
       which was dismissed by a Division Bench of this Court by an order
       dated 29.10.2003, requiring the respondents to open the sealed cover.
       Meanwhile, the petitioner superannuated on 28.02.1997. Thereafter, a
       representation dated 31.10.2003 and reminder 17.11.2003 were made
       by the petitioner to the DDA for opening the sealed cover and praying
       for promotion along with consequential benefits. By a communication
       dated 23.08.2004, the request of the petitioner was declined on the
       ground that another chargesheet was issued against him on
       21.02.1997, i.e. a few days before his retirement. This led to the filing
       of a second writ petition [W.P. (C) 9867/2005] on 10.02.2005 which
       was subsequently transferred to the Tribunal and registered as T.A.
       No. 107/2007.       The T.A. was dismissed by the Tribunal on
       28.02.2008, which has led to the filing of the present writ petition.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P. (C) 7594/2009                                                    Page 2 of 9</span>
<p id="p_8"> 7.     Mr. Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioner, submits that the
       Tribunal has erred both in facts and also in law. He contends that the
       Tribunal has erred in not appreciating that in the earlier DPC dated
       26.07.1996, the petitioner had been promoted but the results were kept
       in a sealed cover on account of a chargesheet which had been issued.
       It is contended that once the first chargesheet was quashed and a
       direction was issued by the Single Judge, the respondent had no choice
       but to comply with the direction of the Single Judge, which attained
       finality as LPA filed by the respondent was dismissed by the Division
       Bench of this court on 29.10.2003. Mr. Gupta contends that once the
       order of the Single Judge had attained finality, the DDA was duty
       bound to comply with the same and merely because a second
       chargesheet was issued, cannot be a ground to deprive the petitioner of
       his promotion, which was withheld only on account of issuance of the
       first chargesheet. It is contended that persons junior to him, as is
       evident upon reading of the seniority list, a copy whereof has been
       placed on record, have been promoted and the petitioner has been
       deprived of the benefit of the DPC, in which he has been promoted.
       Counsel contends that the Tribunal has erred in relying on the O.M.
       dated 14.09.1992 issued by the Government of India for the reason
       that the same would not apply to the facts of the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.     Mr. Gupta also contends that this O.M. stands superseded by a
       subsequent O.M. dated 24.02.2003, which makes it abundantly clear
       that merely because a subsequent chargesheet has been issued would
       not deprive an officer of the promotion. The O.M. dated 24.02.2003
       reads as under: -

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">                          "The right to be considered by the Departmental
                      Promotion Committee is a fundamental right guaranteed
                      under <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_1">Article 16</a> of the Constitution of India, provided a
                      person is eligible and is in the zone of consideration. The
                      sealed cover procedure permits the question of promotion
                      to be kept in abeyance till the result of any pending

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">               3.      It is, therefore, clarified that para 7 of the O.M. dated 14th
               September, 1992 will not be applicable if by the time the seal was
               opened to give effect to the exoneration in the first enquiry,
               another departmental inquiry was started by the department against
               the Government servant concerned. This means that where the
               second or subsequent departmental proceedings were instituted
               after promotion of the junior to the Government servant concerned
               on the basis of the recommendation made by the DPC which kept
               the recommendation in respect of the Government servant in
               sealed cover, the benefit of the assessment by the first DPC will be
               admissible to the Government servant by the first DPC will be
               admissible to the Government servant on exoneration in the first
               inquiry, with effect from the date his immediate junior was
               promoted.

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">               4.      It is further clarified that in case the subsequent
               proceedings (commenced after the promotion of the junior) results
               in the imposition of any penalty before the exoneration in the first
               proceedings based on which the recommendations of the DPC
               were kept in sealed cover and the Government servant concerned is
               promoted retrospectively on the basis of exoneration in the first
               proceedings, the penalty imposed may be modified and effected
               with reference to the promoted post. An indication to this effect
               may be made in the promotion order itself so that there is no

       restricting his prayer to notional promotion without claiming any
       benefit of arrears and only pay fixation solely for the purposes of
       fixation of his pension since the petitioner stands superannuated on

       contends that first O.M. clearly applies to the facts of the present case

       chargesheet was issued the petitioner could not have been given
       benefit of promotion as an officer, whose conduct is under cloud,
       could not have been considered for promotion. He further submits
       that the O.M. dated 24.02.2003 is prospective in nature and was not
       applied to the case of the petitioner.

       dated 22.05.1998 can be deprived the benefit of his promotion.

<p id="p_14"> 14.    The learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the O.M. dated
       24.02.2003, which we have extracted herein above. In the said OM, a
       reference is made to the decision rendered by the Supreme Court in
       <a href="/doc/1405354/" id="a_2">Delhi Jal Board v. Mahinder Singh</a>, (2000) 7 SCC 210. Mr. Birbal
       informs us that a contra view was taken by a larger bench in a
       judgment pronounced almost at the same time in the case of <a href="/doc/1080452/" id="a_3">Union of
       India and Another v. R.S. Sharma</a>, (2000) 4 SCC 394: AIR 2000 SC
       2337.
</p>
<p id="p_15">15.    We may notice that while the judgment in the case of R.S. Sharma
       (Supra) apparently relied upon the O.M. No. 22011/4/91-Estt. (A)
       dated 14.09.1992; while the judgment in the case of Mahinder Singh
       (Supra), took note of the fact that the Single Judge has accepted the
       respondent‟s writ petition following two judgments of the Supreme
       Court in <a href="/doc/1582314/" id="a_4">Bank of India v. Degala Suryanarayana</a>, (1999) 5 SCC 762;
       and <a href="/doc/349389/" id="a_5">State of A.P. v. N. Radhakrishan</a>, (1998) 4 SCC 155, wherein it
       was held that once the first disciplinary inquiry resulted in favour of
       the writ petitioner, the benefit of the findings of the DPC in the sealed
       cover should be given to the writ petitioner notwithstanding the
       pendency of the second inquiry and accepted the view. We do not
       deem it necessary to venture into the controversy for deciding the
       present petition only for the reason that the OMs were not brought to
       the notice of Single Judge, who allowed the writ petition by an order
       dated 22.05.1998 and passed a specific order directing the DDA to
       open the sealed cover and pass directions as per the recommendations
       of the DPC. The Single Judge also directed the DDA to pass orders
       before 30.06.1998 and grant the petitioner the consequential benefits.
       The DDA did not raise this ground even at the time of filing the LPA,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">W.P. (C) 7594/2009                                                   Page 7 of 9</span>
        which was dismissed.     Neither the Single Judge nor the Division
       Bench were informed of the second chargesheet or the OMs. The
       reliance on the OM at this late stage would amount to depriving the
       petitioner the benefit of the order of the Single Judge dated
       22.05.1998, which has attained finality. The respondent cannot be
       allowed to take advantage of this OM, if applicable, for their own fault
       of not bringing the OM to the notice of the Single Judge or even
       before the Division Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_16">16.    We are further of the view that the respondents could have sought a
       review to bring the proper facts to the notice of this Court and seek
       modification of the order of the Single Judge to expunge the part
       directing the respondents to open the seal cover and pass appropriate
       orders. Have failed to do so, the respondents cannot deprive the
       petitioner of the benefits of the order dated 22.05.1998. What the
       respondents could not achieve directly cannot be allowed to be
       achieved indirectly.
</p>
<p id="p_17">17.    On this ground alone, we allow this writ petition and direct the DDA
       to open the sealed cover and in case the petitioner is successful, he
       would be granted the benefit thereof. However, we make it clear that
       the petitioner would not be entitled to any arrears of pay. The pay of
       the petitioner would be fixed only for the purposes of fixing his
       pension and the petitioner would be granted 50% of the arrears of
       pension. The order would be complied with within a period of three
       months from the date of receipt of this judgment. In case, the order is
       not complied with within time fixed, the petitioner would be entitled
       to interest @ 8% p.a.
