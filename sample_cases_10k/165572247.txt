               Ms. Tanuja Basak            ...For Petitioners

               Mr. Rajendra Chaturvedi..For the State



                       Affidavit-of-service filed on behalf of the petitioner in Court be
               kept on the record.

                              This writ application is filed by the petitioners assailing
               two departmental memorandums issued by the Joint Secretary to
               the Government of West Bengal, School Education Department
               (Secondary Branch) under Memo No.957-SE(S)/10M-25/2009 dated
               May 22, 2012 and Memo No.3269-SE(S)/3S-25/2009 dated October
               16, 2012 respectively.
                              The petitioners have been engaged to discharge the
               function of "Guest Teacher" of Barasunda Junior High School,
               District - Hooghly     (a newly set up upper primary school) under
               policy framed by the Government of West Bengal under Memo
               No.674-SE(S)/3S-38/07 dated May 30, 2008.

                              By virtue of the impugned memorandums under
               reference a Joint Secretary to the Government of West Bengal,
               School Education Department (Secondary Branch) fixed the monthly
               remuneration of "Guest Teacher" engaged under newly set up upper
               primary schools. By virtue of the impugned memorandums the
               above joint Secretary to the Government of West Bengal, School
               Education Department (Secondary Branch) fixed the remuneration
               of "Guest Teacher" engaged in newly set up upper primary school
               are contrary to the provisions of column 4 of the Government Order
               No.674-SE(S)/3S-38/07 dated May 30, 2008.

                              Let affidavit-in-opposition be filed within three weeks;
               reply thereto, if any, be filed within one week thereafter.

                              Liberty is given to the parties to mention the matter
               before appropriate Bench for expeditious hearing after expiry of the
               aforesaid periods.
                              The point of maintainability of this writ petition is kept
               open.
                Upon prima facie consideration of the fact that the
Joint Secretary to the Government of West Bengal, School Education
Department (Secretary Branch) issued the impugned memorandums
fixing the remuneration for "Guest Teacher" engaged in newly set up
upper primary schools which contrary to the Government Order
No.674-SE(S)/3S-38/07 dated May 30, 2008, I prima facie find that
the balance of convenience and/or inconvenience is in favour of
staying the operation of the impugned memorandums. Therefore,
the operation of the impugned memorandums are stayed until
further order.
               This order will not prevent the respondent authority</pre>
<p id="p_1">from releasing the monthly remuneration of the petitioner in terms
of the aforesaid Government Order dated May 30, 2008 during the
pendency of this writ application.
</p><p id="p_2">      Urgent photostat certified copy of this order be supplied to the
parties, if applied for, subject to compliance with all necessary
formalities.
</p>
