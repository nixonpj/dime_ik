<p id="p_1">2   11-07-2019                 Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned APP
                   for the State.
</p><p id="p_2">                               2. The petitioners apprehend their arrest for the offences
                   alleged under Section 30(A) of the Bihar Prohibition and <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_1">Excise Act</a>,
                   2016 (hereinafter referred to as 'the <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_2">Prohibition Act</a>, 2016')
                   registered in connection with Ara Nawada P.S. Case No. 399 of 2019.
</p><p id="p_3">                               3. At the very outset, this Court takes note of an order
                   passed by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Ashok Sahani Vs. The
                   State of Bihar, 2017(3) PLJR 632. After a detailed deliberation over
                   the effect of <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_3">Section 76(2)</a> of the Prohibition Act, 2016, it was
                   categorically opined in paragraph-14 that the privilege of pre-arrest
                   bail under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Section 438</a> of the Cr. P.C. is not available to person
                   accused of having committed an offence under the <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_5">Prohibition Act</a>,
                   2016. Certain guidelines (not exhaustive) were also laid out in
                   paragraph-30, indicating circumstances where bail should normally
                   be granted to the accused persons on their production by the police or
                   on their surrender. The Registrar General was also directed to ensure
                   that stamp reporters would not place applications filed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_6">Section
                   438</a> of the Cr. P.C. arising out of the cases under the Prohibition, Act,
 Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.42508 of 2019(2) dt.11-07-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            2/4</span>




          2016 before the Bench as defect free cases henceforth.
</p><p id="p_4">                       4. The aforesaid order in Ashok Sahani's case (supra)
          came to be considered of another co-ordinate Bench of this Court
          passed in Cr. Misc. No. 21578 of 2017 (Manish Kumar @ Lokesh
          Kumar Vs. The State of Bihar) which, by order dated 10.08.2017,
          held the earlier judgment per incuriam, apart from holding the
          provisions of <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_7">Section 76(2)</a> of the Prohibition Act, 2016 as void in
          view of <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_8">Article 254</a> of the Constitution of India. The question
          whether the Registry could be restrained from entertaining
          anticipatory bail petitions as directed in Ashok Sahani's case (supra),
          was referred to a larger Bench.
</p><p id="p_5">                       5. By another judgment dated 03.10.2017 passed by a
          third co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Cr. Misc. No. 42985 of 2017
          (Barun Kumar Vs. The State of Bihar), the issue relating to
          maintainability of anticipatory bail petitions in respect of offences
          under the <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_9">Prohibition Act</a>, 2016 came to be considered yet again.
          The decision in Manish Kumar's case (supra) was found to have been
          passed in oversight of the relevant provisions of the Constitution of
          India as well as <a href="/doc/1235626/" id="a_10">Section 4</a> of the Cr. P.C. which could not be placed
          before it. As such the decision in Ashok Sahani's case (supra) was
          held to be binding on a co-ordinate Bench wherein it had been held
          that an anticipatory bail petition under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_11">Section 438</a> of the Cr. P.C.
          cannot be maintained in cases of offences arising out of the
          <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_12">Prohibition Act</a>, 2016.
</p><p id="p_6">                       6. The reference to the Larger Bench in Cr. Misc. No.
          21578 of 2017 (Manish Kumar @ Lokesh Kumar Vs. The State of
          Bihar) was answered by the Division Bench in its order dated
          06.11.2017 since reported in 2017(4) BLJ PHC-288, opining that the
          Registry could not be restrained from entertaining anticipatory bail
          petition in compliance of the order passed in Ashok Sahani's case
          (supra). However, in paragraph-9 of the said order, it was specifically
          stated that the aspect of the vires/validity/repugnancy of Section
 Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.42508 of 2019(2) dt.11-07-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            3/4</span>




          76(2) was not being considered as the same was already sub-judice
          before the Apex Court. The principles noticed by an earlier Division
          Bench in Bisheshwar Mishra Vs. The State of Bihar, 2016 (4) PLJR
          1058 in the context of a similar bar to grant of anticipatory bail under
          the provisions of SC/<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_13">ST Act</a> in the light of the Apex Court's decision
          in Vilas Pandurang Pawar Vs. State of Maharashtra, (2012) 8 SCC
          795 were taken note of in paragraph-13, which cast a duty upon the
          Court considering the pre-arrest bail of an accused, to look into the
          allegations made in the F.I.R./complaint to find out whether
          ingredients of the offence under the SC/<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_14">ST Act</a> were prima facie
          made out or not before exercising its judicial discretion under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_15">Section
          438</a> of the Cr. P.C. It was therefore held that the law regarding
          consideration of an application under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_16">Section 438</a> of the Cr. P.C. for
          grant of pre-arrest bail to the accused under an Act where there is a
          bar to grant of anticipatory bail, had been settled as such.
</p><p id="p_7">                       7. It is relevant to take note that an order dated 14.02.2019
          was passed by this Bench in Cr. Misc. No. 8719 of 2019 (<a href="/doc/194048211/" id="a_17">Nishikant
          Tiwary and Anr. vs. The State of Bihar</a>) rejecting the prayer for
          anticipatory bail as not maintainable in view of <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_18">Section 76(2)</a> of the
          Prohibition Act, 2016. The said order was assailed before the
          Hon'ble Supreme Court giving rise to Special Leave to Appeal
          (Criminal) No. 2324 of 2019 which, in a recent development, came
          to be dismissed on 11.03.2019, inter alia, with the following
          observations--
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                     "We do not find any reason to
                          interfere in the impugned order passed by the

<p id="p_8">                                     The petitioners are directed to

                          immediately and upon such surrender, if they file
                          an application for bail, the said Court after

                                     expeditiously and in accordance with law".
</p>
<p id="p_9">                                  8. Learned counsel for the petitioners has also not been
                     able to show that any material change on the question of
                     maintainability has come about as a result of the recent judgment
                     dated 17.05.2019 of a Full Bench of this Court in Cr. Appeal (SJ) No.
                     431 of 2019 (<a href="/doc/1691613/" id="a_19">Ram Vinay Yadav vs. The State of Bihar</a>).
</p><p id="p_10">                                  9. Learned counsel for the petitioners has also not been
                     able to satisfy this Court that looking to the allegations made in the
                     F.I.R., the ingredients of the offences alleged against the petitioners
                     have not been made out.
</p><p id="p_11">                                  10. In view of the above, this Court has no hesitation in
                     holding that the anticipatory bail petition in respect of offences
                     alleged against the petitioners under the <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_20">Prohibition Act</a>, 2016 is not
                     maintainable.
</p><p id="p_12">                                   11. The anticipatory bail petition accordingly stands

</p><p id="p_13">                                   12. If the petitioners surrender and seek regular bail
                     before the learned Court below the same shall be considered on its
                     own merit in accordance with law on the same day, without being
                     prejudiced by any observation in the present order.
