                                  JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.       A leisurely evening stroll by Hari Singh placed him in a very 

unusual   situation   where   he   became   a   witness   in   a   murder   case. 


</p><p id="p_2">State v. Vikas Tokas and Anr.                                         Page No.1/43
 While   walking   near   Baba   Gangnath   Mandir   at   about   8.00pm   on 

08.5.2011,   he   heard   a   sound   of   tyre   burst   and   thereafter   heard   a 

person pleading for help to save him.  Almost immediately two young 

men were spotted by him, who came running from inside the park 

from the direction from where the cry to save was heard.  Hari Singh 

was   able   to   see   a   person   in   the   park   who   was   lying   in   injured 

condition, apparently, being shot.  Trepidated by the said situation, he 

straightaway   went   to   the   police   station   Vasant   Vihar   which   was 

nearby and reported the matter.  Police personnels came at the spot 

and   found   a   person   in   injured   condition   and   took   him   to   AIIMS 

Trauma Centre (JPNATC).  However, the victim could not be saved 

as he was declared brought dead by the doctors.   The information 

provided by Hari Singh was reduced into writing which formed the 

basis of FIR no.139/2011 under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_3">34</a> IPC.  



</p><p id="p_3">2.      The investigations carried out by the police led to the identity 

of   the   deceased.     The   leads   available   to   the   police   pointed   out 

towards the friends of the deceased i.e. accuseds Vikas Tokas and 

Inderjeet.  Both of them were apprehended.  Based upon the material 

gathered during the investigation, which included seizure of a cap, 

blood stained earth, countrymade pistol, seizure of the clothes worn 

by the accused persons etc., a final report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_4">section 173</a> Cr.P.C. 

</p><pre id="pre_2">State v. Vikas Tokas and Anr.                                              Page No.2/43
 was filed by the police.  



</pre><p id="p_4">3.      After compliance of the requirement under <a href="/doc/1613898/" id="a_5">section 207</a> Cr.P.C. 

the case was committed to the sessions.   Based upon the material 

placed on record, a prima facie case under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_6">section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_7">34</a> IPC was 

found against both the accuseds and accordingly charge was framed. 

Both the accused persons pleaded not guilty to the same when it was 

read over and explained to them.  It is pertinent to mention here that 

a supplementary chargesheet too was filed which was necessitated by 

the receipt of the FSL result.

PW­27 Sh. Puneet Puri, PW­28 Dr. Hari Shankar Niranjan, PW­29 

HC Shriram and PW­30 Dr. Rajender Kumar.   The evidence coming 

on   record   was   put   to   the   accused   persons   in   order   to   have   their 

versions of the facts and that is how their statements under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_8">section 

313</a>   Cr.P.C.   were   recorded.     Both   the   accused   persons   denied   the 

allegations/   evidence   against   them   and   stated   that   they   have   been 

falsely implicated in this case.  Vikas has gone to the extent of saying 

that   he   does   not   even   know   anybody   by   the   name   of   Lalit,   the 

deceased, and in any case he was not on visiting terms with Lalit 

Kumar.  None of the accused persons opted to lead evidence in their 

defence.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">5.      Arguments   were   raised   by   the   learned   Additional   Public 

Prosecutor for the State and counsels for the accused persons.  I have 

considered   the   contentions   so   raised   and   have   gone   through   the 

record.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">6.      There is practically no eye witness to the incident and as such 

prosecution has attempted to drive home its case against the accused 

persons through circumstantial evidence and attending circumstances 

to it.   The circumstantial evidence which has been relied upon and 

State v. Vikas Tokas and Anr.                                              Page No.4/43
 arrayed, revolve around the following factors i.e. last seen evidence; 

seizure of blood stained earth, stone and clothes; motive of offence; 

recovery of the weapon with which the offence was committed, the 

pointing out memo qua the place of incident and the place where the 

weapon of offence was hidden etc. 



</p><p id="p_11">7.      The mother and uncle of the deceased i.e. PW­6 Uma Devi and 

PW­7 Ram Prakash are the witnesses to the fact that deceased was 

seen alive for the last time in the company of the accused persons. 

Uma   Devi   has   stated   that   it   was   accused   Inderjeet   who   had 

telephonically called her son (deceased) on the date of incident and 

subsequently,   visited   in   the   evening   alongwith   co­accused   Vikas 

Tokas whom she had seen standing in the alley outside her home, and 

her son then accompanied both the accused persons in the evening of 

07.05.2011.  
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">8.      Uncle of the deceased Ram Prakash, who was going to fetch 

petrol   for   his   motorcycle   had   seen   three   persons   i.e.   deceased 

alongwith accused persons standing and talking to each other on the 

road near Baba Gangnath Mandir and had even instructed his nephew 

to go back home early.  So far as this aspect of the testimony of the 

last seen of these two witnesses is concerned, they have steadfastly 

State v. Vikas Tokas and Anr.                                        Page No.5/43
 maintained it in their examination in the court and have come out 

unscathed   and   unruffled   from  the  onslaught  of  cross­examination. 

Thus, the prosecution is able to establish that it was accused persons 

with whom deceased was seen alive for the last time.   The time of 

such spotting by Ram Prakash is very close to the time when the 

murder took place.  Thus, probable inference which can be drawn is 

that   the   victim   was   alive   when   seen   last   in   the   company   of   the 

accuseds.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">9.      The   motive   of   the   offence   seems   to   be   a   bit   hazy   but   the 

explanations/ reasons, which may or may not be sound enough are 

there.     The   evidence   regarding   the   existence   of   a   motive   which 

operates in the mind of the accused is very often very limited, and 

may   not   be   within   the   reach   of   others.     The   motive   driving   the 

accused to commit an offence may be known only to him and to no 

other.   In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive may be a very 

relevant factor.  However, it is the perpetrator of the crime alone who 

is aware of the circumstances that prompted him to adopt a certain 

course of action, leading to the commission of the crime.  Therefore, 

if the evidence on record suggests adequately the existence of the 

necessary motive required to commit a crime, it may be conceived 

that   the   accused   has   in   fact,   committed   the   same   (Vide:  Subedar 

State v. Vikas Tokas and Anr.                                               Page No.6/<a href="/doc/1107450/" id="a_9">43

Daniel v. State of Punjab</a>, (2012) 11 SCC 205).  <a href="/doc/1844193/" id="a_12">In State of Himachal 

Pradesh  v.  Jeet Singh</a>, (1999) 4 SCC 370, the court held that it is a 

sound principle to remember that every criminal  act was done with a 

motive, but its corollary is not that no criminal offence would have 

been   committed   if   the   prosecution   has   filed   to   prove   the   precise 

motive of the accused to commit it and the prosecution succeeded in 

showing   the   possibility   of   some   ire   for   the   accused   towards   the 

victim.  This court held that it is also impossible for the prosecution 

to unravel the full dimension of the mental disposition of an offencer 

towards the person whom he offended.   Refence in <a href="/doc/1928406/" id="a_13">Nathuni Yadav 

and Anr. v. State of Bihar and Anr</a>., (1998) 2 SCC 238.  Nonetheless 

it has been testified that accused Inderjeet intended to shift to the 

house of the deceased for two weeks or so and had brought some of 

his belongings to the place of the deceased inasmuch as the mother 

of  the  deceased  had permitted him to stay with them.   When the 

deceased, however, came to know about it, he opposed the proposal 

and had an altercation with Inderjeet  which, in addition to the fact 

that the deceased was unemployed and was eating out of the earnings 

of the accused persons could be the two reasons/ motives which were 

available with the accused persons to eliminate the deceased.   The 

State v. Vikas Tokas and Anr.                                           Page No.7/43
 third   could   be   the   fight   which   took   place   between   deceased   and 

accused Inderjeet as the latter suspected that the former had stolen 

his mobile phone.   And that  is how things went on complicating. 

Apparently, the motives seem to be shaky, nevertheless, when it is 

appreciated in the light of the fact that the deceased and his widowed 

mother   were   living   in   a   single  room   accommodation   and  in   such 

circumstances, having a third person in the same room may not be 

appreciated   by   the   deceased.     The   opposition   from   the   deceased 

could have acted as a catalyst. Thus, the motive does appear but then 

it   does   not   appear   to   be  as  strong  as   that  it   may  result   in  to the 

murder of the deceased, that too by his own friends.  The other limb 

of the motive which is attributable   to the accused persons is the 

unemployed status of the deceased and the fact that all three used to 

consume alcohol and other drugs together.  The deceased, due to his 

unemployment was unable to contribute in this context but persisted 

to share  the  booty.    These two facts may or may not individually 

constitute   the   motive   but   then   both   these   facts   coupled   with   the 

incident   of   the   stolen   mobile,   if   taken   together   may   constitute   a 

convincing motive for the elimination of the deceased.  This is era of 

fast moving times, where everybody wants everything very quickly. 

Patience is a rare attribute and getting rarer everyday.  The stress and 

strains of the modern day life has driven the persons crazy, who tend 

State v. Vikas Tokas and Anr.                                               Page No.8/43
 to lose temper at the drop of the hat.  The rising incidents of the so 

called road rage leading to fatalities is a testimony into itself.   An 

empty pot is soon hot and given the socio­economic and educational 

background of the accused, coupled with their history of substance 

abuse, it can be presumed that the reasons given above must have 

contributed to constitute a motive.

<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">10.     Hari Singh has since not come up to the expectations of the 

prosecution as he has practically disowned the role attributed to him, 

thus   a   vital   link   comes   down   cropping   bringing   the   inception   of 

prosecution's case under clouds.  It was Hari Singh, who, according 

to   the   police   and   his   statement   Ex.PW3/A,   had   set   the   police 

machinery in action.  He had seen the two persons fleeing from the 

scene and spotted the deceased in the pool of blood.   Nevertheless, 

Hari Singh, apparently, seems to have been won over by the accused 

persons inasmuch as the incident took place at about 8.23pm and by 

8.46 or 8.50pm the victim was in the hospital.  This is not possible 

unless somebody reports the matter to the police at once or almost 

immediately.   Since Hari Singh has not denied his signature on his 

purported statement Ex.PW3/A, which brings on record one fact that 

he was associated with the investigation/ incident and most likely in 

the manner in which it has been reflected by the prosecution.  There 

State v. Vikas Tokas and Anr.                                          Page No.9/43
 was no occasion otherwise to have a signed statement of Hari Singh 

with the police.  He has attempted to wriggle out of the situation by 

saying that he was made to sign on blank papers by the police.   If 

police wanted to have a witness planted then they could have resorted 

to rope in somebody  who could hold his ground then there is no 

reason nor could any be even indicated as to why the police would do 

this   kind   of   act.     Reference   in   this   context   can   be   made   to   the 

judgment in  <a href="/doc/167068104/" id="a_14">Rohtash Kumar v. State of Haryana</a>, 2013 III AD (Cri) 

(SC)   369,   where   it   is   observed   as   follows:   'It   is   settled   legal 

proposition that evidence of a prosecution witness cannot be rejected 

in toto, merely because the prosecution chose to treat him as hostile 

and cross examined him.  The evidence of which witnesses cannot be 

treated as effaced, or washed off the record altogether.  The same can 

be accepted to the extent that their version is found to be dependable, 

upon a careful scrutiny thereof.   <a href="/doc/1967037/" id="a_15">In  State of UP  v.  Ramesh Prasad 

Misra &amp; Anr</a>., AIR 1996 SC 2766, this court held, that evidence of a 

hostile witness would not be rejected in entirety, if the same has been 

given   in   favour   of   either   the   prosecution,   of   the   accused,   but   is 

required   to   be   subjected   to   careful   scrutiny,   and   thereafter,   that 

portion of the evidence which is consistent with the either case of the 

prosecution, or that of the defence, may be relied upon.  (See also: <a href="/doc/1438332/" id="a_16">C.

law permits the court to take into consideration the deposition of a 

hostile witness, to the extent that the same is in consonance with the 

case of the prosecution, and is found to be reliable in careful judicial 

scrutiny.   Hari Singh is residing nearby is a fact and the possibility 

that he was there near at the scene of crime is very probable and 

possible.  Thus his testimony can be relied upon at least to this aspect

Her helplessness is quite apparent.  She, being alone in the dead of 

the   night,   not   knowing   as   to   in   which   hospital   his   son   has   been 

admitted after the accident, as was informed to her by one of the 

accuseds, could have done nothing expect pleading her brother­in­

law, who somehow did not come up to the expectations of the mother 

of the deceased.  Thus, an explanation, seemingly cogent one, is there 

qua the so called questionable conduct of the mother of the deceased. 



</p><p id="p_61">30.     It has been contended on behalf of accused persons that the 

police  has   not   conducted   a  fair  investigation   so   much   so   that   the 

mandatory rules i.e. Punjab Police Rules (PPR), which are applicable 

to the Delhi Police qua the case diary have not been complied with 

and as such the investigation stands vitiated to the point no return and 

makes   the   whole   case   unbelievable.    Presuming  that   the  PPR  are 

applicable, even after the enactment of <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_42">Delhi Police Act</a>, the matter is 

to   be   looked   in   to   as   to   whether   any   prejudice   was   caused.     To 

elaborate further, it has been contended that the Investigating Officer 

has not prepared the site plan qua the recovery of the alleged weapon 

of offence, failed to give the time of arrival of the crime team has not

 clarified as to why no employee of the laboratory from where the 

photos were got printed were examined, how can there be confusion 

with Munirka Enclave and Munirka Vihar and for that matter Baba 

Gang Nath Mandir park etc, in the description and site plan when PS 

is   located   across   the   road.     Besides,   the   testimonies   are   full   of 

unexplained contradictions and inconsistencies which further dents 

the prosecution case.  It is pointed out that there is different versions 

vis­a­vis the time of visit to the place of the deceased.   Smt. Uma 

Devi, the mother of the deceased says that the police personnel came 

to visit her at 6.00am in the morning whereas the police officials 

have consistently maintained that they have gone to the place of the 

deceased at about 1.15am or 2.00am.  The difference of about 4 hours 

cannot be given any benefit of confusion or doubt.  



</p><p id="p_62">31.     So far as the compliance of the procedural rules is concerned, 

the procedural rules are to facilitate the process and further the cause 

of justice and not to frustrate it.  The non­compliance, if any, should 

be shown to be deliberate, conscious and in bad faith and must have 

caused some prejudice to the accused and then probably, the same 

may have the potential to upset the case of the prosecution.  Counsels 

for the accused persons have failed to establish the aforesaid facts, 

particularly any bias or prejudice to the cause to the accused persons.

 Thus,   the   contention   loses   its   sheen   and   strength   qua   the   non­

compliance of the procedural rules.

</p><p id="p_65">32.     As   regards   discrepancies,   the   same   are   bound   to   occur   for 

various reasons, the first and the foremost is the limitation of the 

human mind and memory.   <a href="/doc/167068104/" id="a_43">In  Rohtash Kumar  v.  State of Haryana</a> 

2013 III AD (CRI.) (SC) 369, it is observed that "It is settled legal 

proposition that while appreciating the evidence of a witness, minor 

discrepancies on trivial matters which do not affect the core of the 

case   of   the   prosecution,   must   not   prompt   the   court   to   reject   the 

evidence in its entirety.  Therefore, unless irrelevant details which do 

not in any way corrode the credibility of a witness should be ignored. 

The court has to examine whether evidence read as a whole appears 

to   have   a   ring   of   truth.     Once   that   impression   is   formed,   it   is 

undoubtedly necessary for the Court to scrutinize the evidence more 

particularly   keeping   in   view   the   deficiencies,   drawbacks   and 

infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate them 

to find out whether it is against the general tenor of the evidence 

given   by   the   witnesses   and   whether   the   earlier   evaluation   of   the 

evidence is shaken,  as to render it unworthy of belief.   Thus, the 

court   is   not   supposed   to   give   undue   importance   to   omissions, 

contradictions and discrepancies which do not got to the heart of the 

State v. Vikas Tokas and Anr.                                             Page No.25/43
 matter, and shake the basic version of the prosecution witness.  Thus, 

the   court   must   read   the   evidence   of   a   witness   as   a   whole,   and 

consider   the   case   in   light   of   the   entirety   of   the   circumstances, 

ignoring   the   minor   discrepancies   with   respect   to   trivial   matters, 

which do not affect the core of the case of the prosecution.  The said 

discrepancies   as   mentioned   above,   should   not   be   taken   into 

consideration, as they cannot form grounds for rejecting the evidence 

on record as a whole".   Reference can be made to the judgment in

and the criminal and in the process may not be able to meticulously 

note down the time as to what happened at what time.  Expecting a 

human being to precisely narrate the events and their respective times 

and the steps taken in the investigation with specific details of the 

times   is   seemingly   expecting   too   much.     Then   again,   the   fact   is 

important and a slip here or there qua the time is not specially with 

regard to the point raised by the Counsel for accused persons.  It is a 

fact that the police persons visited the house of the deceased where 

the mother of the deceased met them.  It was in the latter part of the 

State v. Vikas Tokas and Anr.                                           Page No.26/43
 night or early morning and may or may not be 2.00 or 6.00am.  Then 

it is also to be kept in mind that the mother of the deceased Smt. 

Uma Devi is barely literate and in any case she was in a state of 

shock as she was informed by Inderjeet that her son Lalit had met 

with an accident while getting away with his belongings for which he 

went to the house of the deceased after the incident.   Incidentally, 

here is a circumstance which has not been explained by the accused 

Inderjeet where the PW­6 had deposed that on 08.05.2011 at about 1 

AM, Inderjeet came to her house and informed about the accident of 

Lalit.  Inderjeet informed that Vikas too had sustained injuries in his 

hand.  Where was the occasion for accused Inderjeet to say that Lalit 

had met with an accident and is in a hospital.   There could be two 

situations, that Inderjeet wanted to have his belongings, then he could 

waited till morning.  What was the urgency which brought him to the 

house of  deceased  at  the dead of the night, unless he knew what 

exactly had happened, which shows his involvement.   If he did not 

know about the deceased, then where was the occasion with him to 

say that Lalit had met with an accident.  Giving this false information 

by Inderjeet shows his complicity and guilty mind as he somehow 

wanted to take away his belongings from the house of the deceased.  



</p><p id="p_68">34.     Nevertheless,   discrepancies   and   contradictions   and   non­

State v. Vikas Tokas and Anr.                                 Page No.27/43
 compliance of the rules are not very material and thus not fatal as it 

does not affect the real facts of the case.   These are the attending 

circumstances and a slip here or there that too in respect of specific 

time etc. has no potential to dislodge the prosecution's case.  



</p><p id="p_69">35.     It   is   contended   on   behalf   of   accused   persons   that   the   call 

details   do   not   match   testimony   in   as   much   as   the   mother   of   the 

deceased has testified that she had received a call from Inderjeet on 

her mobile phone at about 5.30pm and after about an hour, both the 

accused   Inderjeet   and   Vikas  came  to  her  house  and calling  Lalit. 

Counsel for the accused stated that the CDR nowhere shows that a 

call was received at 5.30 PM by PW­6 Uma Devi rather it was other 

way round and a call was made on the number of accused Inderjeet 

from the number of PW­6 Uma Devi.  PW6 Smt. Meena Devi is not a 

qualified lady. She is barely literate. Then at times it is not known on 

to whether someone near you made a call or received it. Thus, it 

should not be shown out of proportions as to who called whom. The 

fact is that deceased and Inderjeet spoke to each other on telephone at 

about  05.30   pm  and   that  is borne out of records.   The document 

Ex.PW20/A   to   F   cumulatively   show   that   calls   were   exchanged 

amongst three numbers i.e. 9873980284 which was used by accused 

Inderjeet, 9210095178 was used by Smt. Uma and 8447505560 was 

State v. Vikas Tokas and Anr.                                            Page No.28/43
 that of accused Vikas. On 08.05.2011 between 5.00pm to 8.30pm. 

All these calls have a direct relation and connection with the instant 

case as two of the numbers belong to the accused persons and one of 

the   three   belongs   to   the   mother   of   the   deceased.     Thus,   the   call 

details not only substantiate the prosecution's case that the persons 

were   talking   to   each   other.     In   such   circumstances,   this   piece   of 

evidence comes as a kind of confirmatory test of the   allegation as 

this is technical evidence having no scope for any manipulation and 

therefore reliable.

<p id="p_70">

</p><p id="p_71">36.        It is also argued that there are no independent witness to the 

recovery of the firearm and to the other proceedings which make the 

case   further   vulnerable   and   prone   to   doubt   and   suspicion.     It   is 

asserted that the non­preparation of the site plan qua the recovery of 

the firearm further gets a drubbing in view of two versions.   It has 

come  in  evidence that  the weapon of offence was recovered from 

underneath the small grass pile in the statement of PW22 and PW23 

says that it was recovered from the 'Kure' heap of garbage.  In such 

circumstances the recovery pursuant to disclosure becomes doubtful 

and absence of the independent public witness sounds the death knell 

to it.

requirement   of   the   examination   of   an   independent   witness,   and 

whether the evidence of a police witness requires corroboration.  The 

court herein held, that the same must be subject to strict scrutiny. 

However, the evidence of police officials cannot be discarded merely 

on the ground that they belonged to the police force, and are either 

interested in the investigating or the prosecuting agency.  However, as 

far   as   possible   the   corroboration   of   their   evidence   on   material 

particulars, should be sought.  Reference can also be made to <a href="/doc/1256540/" id="a_48">Paras

observed : 'thus, a witness is normally considered to be independent, 

unless he springs from sources which are likely to be tainted and this 

usually means that the said witness has cause, to bear such enmity

</p><p id="p_77">39.     And   above   all,   the   contention   of   learned   counsel   for   the 

accused Vikas seems to be contradictory to the record in as much two 

site   plans   prepared   by   the   Investigating   Officer,   one   where   the 

incident took place Ex.PW22/C and the other is Ex.PW23/DB which

aspects of the investigation could simultaneously be  there and may

with regard to the time of dispatch of tehrir and the time of death is 

approximate and no hard and fast opinion about the time of death can 

be given by any doctor especially at the time of initial examination of 

the   deceased.     Thus,   the   approximation   is   to   be   there   on   certain 

aspects   and   the   time   of   death   is   one   such   aspect.   Similarly,   a

<p id="p_86">

</p><p id="p_87">46.     There are certain circumstances which remain unexplained and 

point   towards   the   complicity   of   the   accused   person.     Test 

Identification Parade refusal is one; the denial by accused Vikas that 

he does not know deceased Lalit which stands negated in light of the 

evidence.  The wrong statement of accused Inderjeet qua the accident 

of deceased as was conveyed to the mother of deceased.  Where was 

the occasion with the accused Inderjeet to say something which was 

not correct except when he knew that what exactly had happened to 

the deceased.  He has explained the absence of Vikas by saying that 

he has also sustained injury, which indicates that he was a privy to 

the acts of the accused Vikas.   The documents qua the injury were 

collected through the seizure memos Ex.PW23/B and Ex.PW4/A and 

State v. Vikas Tokas and Anr.                                        Page No.35/43
 memo   Ex.PW23/A.     These   documents  indicate   that  Vikas  got   his 

injury treated in a private hospital and furnished a false information 

to the hospital staff about his injury.  Evidence has come to the effect 

that both accused Inderjeet and Vikas got recovered clothes through 

seizure memo Ex.PW19/J and Ex.PW19/K respectively.  There is no 

explanation with the accused Vikas as to wherefrom the blood stains 

come   on   his   clothes,   except   that   while   crossing   the   grill   on   the 

central verge of the road he got injured.   And for that matter how 

Vikas got blood stains on his T­shirt as the injury from the grill was 

on   his   hips.     The   photographs,   especially   the   photographs   of   the 

hands of Vikas having small reddish brown spots / gun powder injury 

marks on  both  his hands which are Ex.PW22/X­1 to X­6 coupled 

with the opinion of the doctor and the injury sustained by deceased 

indicates that gun shot was fired from the point blank range, which 

increases the possibility of having gun powder marks on the hand of 

the  person   firing   the   gun  shot.    The  possibility becomes  stronger 

when a crude/ countrymade firearm is used as it lacks sophistication 

and precision of a good quality weapon as is the case here.   The 

opinion Ex.PW24/B coupled with the above facts and the weapon

 the   guilt   of   the   accused(s).     The   time   factor   and   proximity   with 

different   events   further   cement   it.     According   to   PW­24   Dr. 

Raghvendra Bagla the time of death of deceased Lalit was about a 

day or half day.   He obviously spell about it from the day and time 

when   the   post­mortem   examination   was   done.     This   matches   the 

sequence of events unfolding in the evidence.  Similarly, his opinion 

qua the injuries on the forearm of Vikas could be one day old and 

possibility   of   firearm   injury   was   not   ruled   out   by   PW­24   Dr. 

Raghvendra Bagla.  He also mentions about taking control swab and 

swab from the injured forearm of Vikas for the traces of gun powder. 

The opinion qua that from FSL further seals the fact of the accused, 

which is Ex.PW22/L.

firearm used in the offence both being in the exclusive knowledge of 

the accused persons primarily Vikas and the element of exclusivity is 

stronger in the instant case given the minimal time gap between the 

time   of   occurrence   and   the   recovery   of   weapon   of   offence   and 

preparation of the documents referred above.  The motive aspect has 

been dealt with earlier as it has come in evidence that an altercation 

had taken place between the deceased and accused Inderjeet as the 

mother of deceased had agreed for the stay of Inderjeet in her house 

State v. Vikas Tokas and Anr.                                           Page No.37/43
 which was strongly opposed by deceased which led to the altercation. 

This fact coupled with other aspects mentioned earlier gives motive 

for the offence.

</p><p id="p_92">49.     The   opinion   of   doctor   with   regard   to   the   cause   of   death 

expressed in Ex.PW24/A leaves no scope for any doubt as the death 

was   due   to   respiratory   failure   resulting   from   gun   shot   injury 

produced by a projectile fired by a firearm.  Post­mortem report also 

indicates that bullet entered from one side of the body and made its 

exit from the other side of the body and on the way punctured both 

the lungs of the deceased.  All this go hand in hand with the facts of 

the case.  This seals the fate of accused Vikas as the prime accused 

responsible   for   murdering   the   deceased   Lalit.     The   conduct   of 

Inderjeet makes him an active accomplice in the offence and thus, he 

too  is  equally   liable  for  the offence of  murder in the light of the 

evidence on record and in view of the provision under <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_66">section 34</a> 

IPC.

countrymade   pistol   was   recovered   at   his   instance   reflecting   his 

consciousness qua the possession/ owning it, which was used in the 

offence of murder.  In such circumstances, he can be attributed with 

the possession of the same as well inasmuch as the accused has been 

convicted under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_70">section 302</a> IPC, which by implication amounts to 

the use of weapon in question.   Accordingly, accused Vikas is held

Order on Sentence

</pre><p id="p_106">1.       It is contended on behalf of convicts that they are youngmen, 

having  no   criminal  antecedent and the case does not fall  into the 

scope and ambit of the rarest of the rare cases, therefore, appropriate 

sentence may be awarded to them.  
</p>
<p id="p_107">


</p><p id="p_108">State v. Vikas Tokas and Anr.                               Page No.40/43
</p><p id="p_109"> 2.      On the other hand, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for 

State submits that in view of the fact that the convicts have sniffed 

out a life for seemingly no reason therefore, such an irresponsible 

behaviour   does   not   call   for   any   leniency   or   consideration,   thus, 

adequate punishment is called for in such circumstances.



</p><p id="p_110">3.      The role of the judge as a sentencer is crucial, as a delicate 

balance is to be struck juxtaposing the conflicting facts.  <a href="/doc/1513958/" id="a_73">In Goswami 

B.C. v. Delhi Administration</a>, the Supreme Court observed: "Now the 

question  of  sentence  is  always a difficult  question, requiring as it 

does,   proper   adjustment   and   balancing   of   various   considerations 

which   weigh   with   a   judicial   mind   in   determining   its   appropriate 

quantum in a given case.  The main purpose of the sentence broadly 

stated is that the accused must realize that he has committed an act 

which   is   not   only   harmful   to   the   society   of   which   he   forms   an 

integral   part   but   is   also   harmful   to   his   own   future,   both   as   an 

individual and as a member of the society.  Punishment is designed to 

protect society by deterring potential offenders as also by preventing 

the guilty  party   from  repeating the offence;  it  is also designed to 

reform the offender and re­claim him as a law abiding citizen for the 

good of the society as a whole.  Reformatory, deterrent and punitive 

aspect   of  punishment   thus play their due part in judicial thinking 

State v. Vikas Tokas and Anr.                                             Page No.41/43
 while   determining   this   question.     In   modern   civilized   societies, 

however, reformative aspect is being somewhat greater importance. 

Too  lenient   as   well   as   too   harsh   sentence   both   loose   their  

efficaciousness.     One   does   not   deter   and   the   other   may   frustrate  

thereby making the offender a hardened criminal"



</p><p id="p_111">4.      In the instant matter, the convicts have taken a life, a life which 

cannot be given back by them or by anybody.  There is seemingly no 

justification as to why such an extreme step was taken by them.  On 

the other hand, the convicts, their lives, their dependents and other 

near and dears are there, who also have to be taken care of.



</p><p id="p_112">5.      However, the convicts have since committed the murder and 

there are only two punishments provided for under section <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_74">section 

302</a> IPC.   It is indeed correct that the murder committed by them 

does not fall into the category of rarest of the rare, therefore, there is 

only one sentence which can be awarded to them which is that of 

imprisonment for life.  Since both the convicts namely Vikas Tokas 

and   Inderjeet   have   been   guilty   of   the   offence   punishable   under 

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_75">section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_76">34</a> IPC, hence both of them are sentenced to undergo 

rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay a sum of Rs.25,000/­ each
