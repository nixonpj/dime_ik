         Municipal Corporation through its Municipal Commissioner and the
         Director, N.H.L. Municipal Medical College inter alia praying that
         the judgment and order dated 18.12.2003 passed in Application
         No.2 of 2000 by the Gujarat Affiliated Colleges Services Tribunal at
         Ahmedabad may be quashed and set aside.</p><pre id="pre_2">

         respondent No.3. Perused the material placed on record.
</p>

<p id="p_3">         [3]          While admitting this petition, Notice as to interim relief
         was issued, and thereafter, interim relief was granted in terms of
         paragraph 8(C).           Accordingly, the judgment and order in
         Application No.2 of 2000 passed by the Gujarat Affiliated Colleges
         Services Tribunal at Ahmedabad dated 18.12.2003 was ordered to
         be stayed. Thus, the direction given in the judgment is not made
         effective till date.
</p>

<p id="p_4">         [4]          The respondent No.1 has moved an application before
         the Tribunal seeking promotion to the post of Associate Professor
         in the Pediatric Branch.        According to respondent No.1, she is
         entitled to be appointed on the said post after completion of 10
         years of service in the respondent College. Since the respondent
         College did not consider the case of the respondent No.1 (original
         applicant), an application was moved before the Tribunal seeking
         direction to grant her promotion as an Associate Professor.
         Learned Tribunal after considering the submissions advanced by
         the learned advocates for the parties, as also the material placed
         on record, has reached to the conclusion that the respondent No.1
         (original applicant) is entitled to get promotion as an Associate
         Professor in the pay scale of Rs.1100-1600/-.

         been given promotion to the post of Associate Professor, whereas
         the case of the petitioner was not considered.                             But the said
         teaching staff was not made party before the Tribunal, and without
         giving an opportunity of being heard, the order dated 18.12.2003
         came to be passed by the Tribunal. Moreover, the Tribunal has
         passed an order to the effect that the applicant is entitled to get
         the promotion, and also entitled for the pay scale of Rs.1100-
         1600/-, and accordingly, the application was allowed by the
         Tribunal. Usually in the matter of promotions, directions are given
         by the Court/Tribunal to the effect that if an applicant/petitioner is
         satisfying the eligibility criteria for grant of promotion under
         requisite Rules, the case of such an employee may be considered
         in accordance with law.           But instead of passing such an order,
         straightway a declaration was made by the Tribunal that she is
         entitled to get the promotion and that too without hearing the
         affected parties.         Moreover, the Tribunal before reaching to the
         conclusion about entitlement of respondent No.1 to get promotion
         to the post of Associate Professor, has held that the case of
         respondent      No.1       (original   applicant)         is   covered under               the
         Government Resolution dated 22.10.1981 issued by the Health
         and Family Welfare Department, and relying upon the said
         Government Resolution, it has been decided by the Tribunal that
         the applicant is entitled to get promotion to the post of Associate
         Professor.

<p id="p_6">         [6]          In view of the aforesaid position, this Court is of the
         view that instead of remitting the case to the learned Tribunal for
         reconsideration, looking to the facts and circumstances as
         discussed hereinabove, the matter is required to be remitted to
         the appropriate authority of the petitioners who is competent to
         take decision.        The question of seniority and entitlement of

         promotion as well as entitlement of getting particular pay scale is
         required to be looked into and decided by the appropriate
         authority    in    accordance    with         rules   and      regulations.             The
         appropriate authority shall take decision after affording an
         opportunity of being heard to the respondent.

<p id="p_7">         [7]           Moreover, it also appears that by now the respondent
         No.1 (original applicant before the Tribunal) has retired from the
         services. Under the circumstance, the judgment and order dated
         18.12.2003 passed in Application No.2 of 2000 by the Gujarat
         Affiliated College Services Tribunal at Ahmedabad is ordered to be
         set aside and the matter is remitted to the appropriate authority of
         the petitioners for its further consideration and taking final
         decision within a period of 2 months from the date of receipt of the
         order. If the appropriate authority comes to the conclusion that
         the respondent No.1 is eligible and entitled to get the benefit of
         promotion and higher pay scale, the arrears of differential amount
         shall be paid expeditiously preferably within a period of one month
         from the date of taking such decision. The petition is allowed
         accordingly. Rule is made absolute to the aforesaid extent.
