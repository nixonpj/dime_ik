 IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR RAJASTHAN
BENCH AT JAIPUR
S.B. CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.184/1997
Mahakaleshwar Shikshan Prashikshan Sanstha 
vs.
State &amp; Ors.

Date of order :	               20/4/2010.

	HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE MOHAMMAD RAFIQ

Shri Amit Singh on behalf of Shri Sandeep Saxena for the petitioner.
Shri Ganesh Meena, Government Counsel for the State.
Shri R.A. Katta for respondent no.2.
******		 
</pre><p id="p_1">	This writ petition was filed way back in the year 1997 with the prayer that the respondent-State be directed to consider the report submitted by Inspecting Team on 26.6.1996 and on that basis grant No Objection Certificate to the petitioner for running B.Ed. College from the academic sessions 1997-98 and accordingly Mohan Lal Sukhadia University to grant affiliation. 
</p><p id="p_2">	This Court was persuaded to issue show cause notice to the respondents by its order dated 22.1.1997. The respondents in reply have submitted that re-inspection was carried out at the institution run by the petitioner on 26.6.1996 and on that basis a decision was taken not to grant NOC to the petitioner. On perusal of the present writ petition, it appears that the respondent at that time decided not to issue NOC in favour of the petitioner on the premise that there were complaints against them of charging donation, but now after lapse of so much of time i.e. of 13 years from the date of filing of the writ petition, those issues need not be gone into. If at all, the petitioner is interested in setting up a B.Ed. College, its application now shall have to be routed for NOC as per the provisions of National Council for Teacher Education, Act 1993. 
</p><p id="p_3">	The writ petition is therefore disposed of with the aforesaid liberty to the petitioner. It goes without saying that if any such application is submitted by the petitioner, he will have to satisfy the concerned authorities as per the provisions contained in the said Act, which obviously would be considered by them in accordance with law.
