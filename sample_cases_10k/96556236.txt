ORDER:­

</p><p id="p_3">  1.               Vide   this   order,   I   shall   decide   the   present   revision 

     petition filed u/s 397/401 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">Cr.P.C</a>. against the order dated 26.8.2010 

     passed   by   the   Ld.   MM   in   complaint   case   no.46/01   whereby 

     revisionists were summoned u/s 323 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_4">  2.               Brief   facts   which   are   necessary   for   the   disposal   of 

     present petition are that respondent no.2 Shiv Prakash has filed the 

     case   against   the   revisionist   and   other   police   officials   of   PS 

     Samaypur   Badli   alleging   that   on   11.7.2001   at   about   9   pm,   the 

     revisionist along with other police officials came to his residence and 

     took him along with his son Jai Kumar to the police station where 

     their hands were tied with a tree and beatings were given to them by 


                                                                          Page 2 of  page 8
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         3</span>

   danda, pipe etc. and thereafter forcibly implicated them in case FIR 

   no.437/09 u/s 307/341/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a>.  Despite filing complaint to the police 

   no  action  was  taken.    Hence  complaint  case  u/s.  200   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a>.  by 

   respondent no.2 against revisionist and others persons was filed. Ld. 

   MM after recording evidence of respondent and his son who were 

   examined as CW1 and CW2, vide order dated 26.8.2010 ordered to 

   take   cognizance   u/s   323   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>   and   ordered   to   summon   the   police 

   officials and   other.   Being aggrieved present revision petition has 

   been filed to set aside the said order.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.               It is argued by the Ld. Counsel for the revisionist that Ld. 

   MM has taken the cognizance without any material on record only on 

   the  basis   of bald  statement of  respondent  no.1  and his   son.    He 

   further   argued   that   revisionist   being   police   official   enjoy   certain 

   protection under the law and cognizance cannot be taken against 

   them   in   view   of   provisions   u/s   140   <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_7">Delhi   Police   Act</a>,   1978   and 

   complaint has been filed after one year of the incident.   He further 

   argued that complaint is also barred by limitation as per provisions of 

   <a href="/doc/1599077/" id="a_8">Section 468</a> Cr.P.C. as maximum punishment provided u/s 323 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">IPC</a> 

   is only one year, therefore, cognizance can be taken within one year 

   whereas in this case complaint has been filed after the expiry of one 



                                                                         Page 3 of  page 8
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                             4</span>

     year.  On merits Ld. Counsel for revisionist argued that  Ld. MM has 

     failed to appreciate that as per his own admission, application filed 

     by   the   accused   u/s   54   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_10">Cr.P.C</a>.   in   case   FIR   no.46/01   in   which 

     revisionist     was   arrested.     He   has   suffered   injuries   through 

     complainant party and not through the police officials.  Therefore, his 

     statement   in   complaint   case   is   false   and   should   not   have   been 

     believed for taking cognizance against revisionists.

</p><p id="p_6">4.                  On the other hand, Ld. Counsel for the respondent no.2 

     has argued that order passed by the Ld. MM is correct and has no 

     infirmity.   He further submits that since act of revisionist and other 

     police officials who gave beatings to respondent no.2 and his son 

     does not come within the ambit of duty of public servant.  Hence no 

     sanction u/s 197 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11">Cr.P.C</a>. or u/s 140 <a href="/doc/190803/" id="a_12">Delhi Police Act</a> is required.  He 

     further argued that  there is no delay in filing the complaint and case 

     is not barred by the limitation and even otherwise if it is barred, this 

     court is competent to condone the delay.   
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.                  I   have   heard   the   arguments   and   gone   through   the 

     record. First I shall decide the application u/s. 5 of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_13">Limitation Act</a> 

     for   condonation   of   delay.   It   is   argued   by   the   ld.   Counsel   for   the 

     Revisionist that revisionist no.1 had no knowledge of the pendency 



                                                                                Page 4 of  page 8
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       5</span>

   of the complaint case and the order of summoning and he came to 

   know about the same only on 02.05.2012. On perusal of the main 

   complaint case file it is evident that Balbir Singh (Revisionist No.2) 

   has been served upon 27.3.2012 and he has appeared in the court 

   on 29.3.2012, whereas revisionist no.1 has been personally served 

   on   22.6.2012.   Though,   he   might   have   been   informed   by   the 

   Revisionist No.2, prior to it. Hence, period of limitation starts from 

   27.3.2012 as same is to be recorded from date of service not from 

   date of passing of order. Period for  limitation in revision is 90 days. 

   Petition has been filed on 25.5.2012. Hence, I held that petition is 

   within the limitation. Therefore, I allow the application.

</p><p id="p_8">6.              Now   coming   on   the   main   petition,     on   perusal   of   the 

   complaint I found that complaint has been filed on 01.04.2003, in 

   which the date of alleged offence mentioned as 11.7.2001. Hence, 

   petition has been filed almost 21 months after the date of incident, 

   cognizance has been taken by ld. Trial MM vide <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_14">Section 323</a> IPC, 

   which provide maximum punishment for one year. As per <a href="/doc/1599077/" id="a_15">Section 

   468(b)</a> of Cr.P.C. period of limitation for taking cognizance is  one 

   year. Hence, cognizance has been taken by ld. MM after expiry of 

   period of limitation. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">                                                                         Page 5 of  page 8
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                          6</span>

</p><p id="p_11">7.                As far as contention of ld. Counsel for the revisionist that 

   court can condone the delay u/s. 473 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_16">Cr.P.C</a>., therefore, when ld. 

   MM has taken the cognizance, it implies that he has been condoned 

   the   delay.   There   is   no   doubt   that   the   court   taking   cognizance   is 

   competent to condone the delay, but the Ld. Judge while condoning 

   delay   must   indicate   that   he   was   satisfied   on   the   fact   and 

   circumstances of case that the delay has been properly explained or 

   it is necessary to condone the delay in the interest of justice, as held 

   in  State of Himachal Pradesh Vs. Tara Dutta AIR 2000 (SC) 297. 

   But, on perusal   of the order of ld. MM I found that order does not 

   reflect any such satisfaction. Further it is also necessary for the court 

   to give notice to the other party before condoning the delay, as held 

   in Rajeev Kumar &amp; Others Vs. Registrar of Companies of GNCT of  

   Delhi and others  Crl. Misc. No.23/05, decided on 05/05/2009 and  

   also in case <a href="/doc/825525/" id="a_17">Sharadchandra Vinayak Dongre and Others vs State of  

   Maharashtra</a> 1991 Cri.L.J. 3329. But, in this case no such notice of 

   condoning of delay was given to the revisionists before condoning 

   the   delay.   Therefore,   in   my   view   order   of   ld.   MM   of   taking 

   cognizance against the revisionist and summoning order is liable to 

   be set aside on the ground alone that petition is barred by limitation. 



</p><p id="p_12">                                                                            Page 6 of  page 8
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       7</span>

   In such circumstances, though, I can send back the case to ld. MM 

   to decide the issue of limitation by giving notice to the revisionist, but 

   I am not doing the same as in my view order is also liable to be set 

   aside on merit also.
</p>
<p id="p_13">8.               Complainant/respondent   No.2   has   alleged   in   his   pre­

   summoning   evidence   while   examining   himself   as   CW1   that   on 

   11.7.2001   at   about   9pm,   when   he   and   his   other   family   members 

   were present 5­6 police officials including revisionist came and took 

   him and his son to the PS , where they gave him and his son beating 

   after tying them with the tree. And on giving application in the court 

   he   and   his   son   was   medically   examined.   Thereafter,   he   made 

   complaint   to the SHO and also forwarded the same to ACP/DCP, 

   which he proved as Ex.CW1/F. Same facts has narrated by his son 

   Jai   Kumar   CW2   while   relying   upon   their   testimony   Ld.   MM   has 

   summoned the Revisionist alongwith other respondent. But, in my 

   view ld. MM has not fully appreciated all the material available to him 

   and only swayed away by the statement of CW1 &amp; CW2. Had he 

   gone through the complaint Ex.CW1/A, he would have dismissed the 

   complaint, as in the complaint Ex.CW1/A, he has made no allegation 

   against police official. In complaint Ex.CW1/A he has not stated that 



                                                                       Page 7 of  page 8
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                               8</span>

      either he or his son was given beating by them beating by them. 

      Further  in the application dated  12.7.2001, u/s. 54 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_18">Cr.P.C</a>., which 

      was filed by the complainant/ respondent no.2 when he was produce 

      before ld. MM for his medical examination. He has stated that injury 

      has been caused to him by the complainant party and he has not 

      made any allegation that police officials have given beatings. First 

      time he levelled the allegations against the police official including 

      the   revisionist     as   the   person   who   gave   beating   in   his   complaint
