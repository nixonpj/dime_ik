<p id="p_1">                     This is an appeal filed by the appellants against the order 

dated 02.01.2013 passed by Ms. Veena Rani Ld. Additional Rent Controller, 

Patiala   House   Courts,   New   Delhi     whereby   Ld.   ARC   has   dismissed   the 

application of the appellants/respondents U/s 151 CPC.




2                    The brief fact of the case are that respondent/landlord has 

filed a eviction petition U/s 14 ( 1 ) ( e) of DRC Act in respect of premises 

bearing   No.   84,   Tolstoy   Lane,   Janpath,   New   Delhi   against   the 

appellants/respondent   on   the   ground   of   bonafide   requirement.     It   is 

submitted in the petitioner that petitioner/respondent is the owner/landlord of 

the disputed premises and the same has been let out to the respondents as 

per   lease   deed   dated   7.3.1988.   It   is   further   submitted   that   the   disputed 

premises   are   bonafide   required   by   the   landlord/respondent   for   his   son 

Sanjay who is doing the advertising business in Lajpat Nagar in the name of 

M/s Imagic Communcatipns ( P) Ltd at a monthly rental of Rs. 1,30,000/­ PM 

besides service tax and the rent is quite high and excessive and causing

 great financial hardship to Sh. Sanjay.
</p>
<p id="p_2">


3                   Appellants/respondents have filed application for leave to 

defend   before   Ld.   ARC.   Thereafter   appellants/respondents   moved   an 

application U/s 151 CPC for placing additional affidavit on record in support 

of application for leave to defend.  Reply to this application has been filed by 

the respondent/landlord.
</p>
<p id="p_3">4                   After   considering   the   pleadings   of   the   parties   and 

arguments   addressed   on     behalf   of   the   parties,   the   learned   trial   Court 

dismissed the application of the appellant/respondent U/s 151 CPC.




5                   Aggrieved from the said order, present appeal has been 

filed by the appellant on the ground inter alia that the Court below failed to 

apply the law and dismissed the application of the appellants. The ld. ARC 

failed to appreciate that the law does not restrict filing of additional affidavit 

to further the  cause  of justice.  That  the  ld. ARC  grossly  erred in law  by 

holding that the application would defeat the very purpose of the section 14 ( 

1 ) ( e ) of DRC Act. It is prayed by the appellants that the order dated 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">RCA No. 05/2013                                                 Page No. 3 of 9</span>
 2.1.2013 dismissing the application U/s 151  CPC be set aside. 




6                   The ld. Counsel for appellant has submitted that the Court 

below reached to the wrong conclusion by dismissing the application of the 

appellant for adducing additional affidavit.   Ld. Counsel of the appellant has 

further submitted that the rule of summary procedure is hit by existence of 

contextual issue between the appellant /tenant  and the landlord/respondent. 

The contextual issue between the party is that respondent/landlord received 

one eviction order in his favour on the same ground of bonafide requirement 

and existence of that eviction order, the landlord is not entitled to have the 

similar order on the same ground. Therefore, the additional  affidavit filed 

before the Court below is sine qua none to bring on record this fact. Ld. 

Counsel   for   the   appellant     has   further   submitted   that   the   summary   trial 

includes the appeal under section 38 of the Act which define the word 'shall'. 

It is further submitted that the provision u/s 38 of the DRC Act is inserted in 

the year 1988 and has given power to file an appeal only on the question of 

law point and because of this reason an appeal is filed. The ld. Counsel for 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">RCA No. 05/2013                                                 Page No. 4 of 9</span>
 appellant further submit that appeal of the appellant be allowed and order 

dated 2/1/2013 be set aside. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">


7                    On  the  other   hand     Ld.  Counsel   for  respondent/landlord 

has   submitted   that   the   respondent   has   filed   an   eviction   petition   under 

bonafide need u/s 25(b) of DRC Act, 1958, which is a special provision given 

in DRC Act itself which is called summary procedure.  The intention of the 

legislature is very clear while dealing with the bonafide requirement and the 

special provision i.e. summary trial is made out in the DRC Act, 1958 which 

bars appeal and second appeal. Therefore, the present appeal filed under 

section 38 of the Act where the word 'shall' excludes the present summary 

procedure. It is because of this reason two separate provisions are enacted 

by   the   legislature.   It   is   further   submitted   by   the   ld.   Counsel   for   the 

respondent that appeal  is  not maintainable as per scheme of the Act as 

envisaged in Section 25 (A) , (B) (8) of DRC Act and only revision lies to 

Hon'ble High Court of Delhi and filing of the second affidavit is not permitted 

as per law. ld. Counsel for the respondent/owner Sh. C. P. Wig has further 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">RCA No. 05/2013                                                   Page No. 5 of 9</span>
 submitted that the argument raised by the appellant is pre­mature. The order 

which is stated to be passed is already stayed by the Hon'ble High Court of 

Delhi in the revision filed by the tenant and the respondent had not received 

any possession of the alleged premises covered by that petition and prays 

that appeal of the appellant be dismissed with cost.   The ld. Counsel has 

relied on the judgments  Budh Singh &amp; Others V/s Sangeeta Kedia   RC 


REV 453/2011 &amp; CM No. 20603­04/2011 decided on 17.11.2011,   Mohd
