08/13.04.2015</pre><p id="p_1">        Though a number of prayers have been made in the writ
                petition including a prayer for seeking mandamus for declaring
                the post of Home Guard as Civil Post, but learned counsel
                appearing on behalf of the petitioners, upon survey of the
                parent Act under which the Home Guards were raised i.e. Bihar
                Home Guards Act, 1947 and its successor Jharkhand Home
                Guard Act, 2005 and its relevant Provisions, has not been able
                to prima facie satisfy that such a relief for declaration of the
                post of Home Guard as a Civil Post is made out. It appears that
                Home Guard Force has been created as Volunteer Force in the
                wisdom of the State by passing the respective enactment, which
                is in the domain of policy decision of the executive. Comparison
                to uniform forces like the police force or any other para military
                forces, in such circumstances, by the petitioners would be far
                fetched as indeed there is intelligible differentia in the
                classification made while creating volunteer force like the
                Home Guard compared to a fully organized uniform police force
                of a permanent nature by the State. It, however, appears that
                under the Act of 2005 Section 12 requires framing of Rules
                laying down the service conditions of Home Guard.
</p><p id="p_2">                     Learned counsel for the State at present is not in position
                to say as to whether such Rules have been framed by the State
                or not.
</p><p id="p_3">                     Having regard to the aforesaid relief sought for by the
                petitioners, it is deemed appropriate to allow the respondent-
                State to come out with their response on the said prayer and
                file counter affidavit indicating whether such Rules have been
                framed or not and whether the service conditions of such Home
              Guard have been properly defined in conformity      with the
             parent Act under which they have been created.
</p><p id="p_4">                  Accordingly, learned counsel for the respondent-State is
             allowed four weeks' time to do so.
</p><p id="p_5">                  List this case after four weeks under the appropriate
             heading.
