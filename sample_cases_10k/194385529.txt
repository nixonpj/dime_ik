      This Transfer Application under sec.24 has been filed for

transfer of Case No.453/2016 (Shivdutt Sharma v. Smt Sapna),

10.12.2006. Out of the marriage, two daughters and one son were

born. The respondent started harassing her and on several

occasions subjected her to domestic violence on the ground of

dowry, for demand of Rs.15 Lacs and one luxury car. The

petitioner was ultimately turned out of the matrimonial home on

29.05.2016 and she is forced to live with her parents. The

petitioner and her parents tried to settle through Panchayat but all

efforts failed.
                                    (2 of 3)
                                                                  [CTA-57/2017]

     Thereafter, an FIR (No.136 dated 02.07.2016) was lodged

before Women Police Station, Bikaner against the respondent and

his family members for offence under secs.498A, 406, 323, 120B,

354 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>, in which after investigation the Police has filed challan

and the case is pending for trial before learned Additional Chief

Judicial Magistrate No.3, Bikaner. An application under sec.12 of

the Protection of Women from <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_2">Domestic Violence Act</a> has also

been filed before the learned Additional Civil Judge (SD) &amp;

Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate No.3, Bikaner. It was also

contended that the petitioner has no independent source of

income for maintaining herself and her children. She has filed an

application for maintenance from respondent under sec.125 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3">CrPC</a>,

which is pending before the Family Court No.1, Bikaner.

     The respondent Shiv Dutt has filed an application under

sec.9 of the <a href="/doc/590166/" id="a_4">Hindu Marriage Act</a> against the petitioner before

Family   Court,   Ajmer,   which      has     been   registered   as    Case

No.453/2016 and is pending before the Family Judge, Ajmer.

     Notices were issued and even after due service, no one has

appeared for the respondent.

     Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.

     After the marriage, two daughters and a son born out of the

wedlock. On account of cruelty and domestic violence on the

ground of demand of dowry for Rs.15 Lacs and one luxury car, an

FIR was lodged against the respondent and after investigation,

challan was filed under secs.498A, 406, 323, 120B, 354 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a>,

which case is pending for trial before ACJM No.3, Bikaner. An

application under sec.12 of the Protection of Women from
                                   (3 of 3)
                                                                [CTA-57/2017]

<a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_6">Domestic Violence Act</a> is also pending before the ACJM No.3,

Bikaner and proceedings under sec.125 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">CrPC</a> is also pending

before the Family Judge, Bikaner.

     The petitioner has no independent source of income for

maintaining herself as well as her children. It is very difficult and

inconvenient   for   a   lady    to   travel   all   alone,,   under    the

circumstances when she had no independent source of income and

having three children, for contesting the case pending before the

Family Judge, Ajmer.

     In view of aforesaid and in light of judgment of Hon'ble

Supreme Court in Vaishali Shridhar Jagtap v. Shridhar

Vishwanath Jagtap reported in 2016 (4) WLN 237 (SC), it is a

fit case to be transferred.

     Accordingly, this Transfer Application is allowed and the Case

No.453/2016 (Shivdutt Sharma v. Smt Sapna), filed by the

respondent under sec.9 of the <a href="/doc/590166/" id="a_8">Hindu Marriage Act</a>, pending before

the Family Court, Ajmer is ordered to be transferred to the Family

Court at Bikaner.
