CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE NAVANITI PRASAD SINGH
           and
           HONOURABLE JUSTICE SMT. NILU AGRAWAL
ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE NAVANITI PRASAD SINGH)
Date: 17-08-2015

                   I.A.No. 6564 of 2015 has been filed for stay of the order of the

   Central Administrative Tribunal, as passed in O.A. No.539 of 2011, being the

   judgment and order dated 22nd October, 2014(Priyanka Singh Vs. Union of India

   and others).
</p>
<p id="p_10">                   2. Having heard the learned for the Union of India in regard to the

   said application at length, we are of the view that it is neither a case for grant of

   stay nor of any further indulgence by this Court in writ jurisdiction. The applicant

   before the Tribunal had applied for the post of Postal/Sorting Assistant in the

   Postal Department, pursuant to advertisement issued. She was short-listed and

   appeared in the typing/computer test and in Aptitude test. She was provisionally
            Patna High Court CWJC No.9001 of 2015 dt.17-08-2015

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                    2/2</span>




                   selected and she went to medical examination. At that stage, instead of issuing a

                   letter of appointment and order to join, she was informed that she did not possess

                   the essential qualification for recruitment, and has been deleted from the select

                   list. The reason is that she did not have the Hindu(local language) either in

                   Matriculation or Intermediate, which was essential for the post.

</p><p id="p_11">                                   3.The matter was contested in the Tribunal, and the Tribunal

                   noticed that she had studied upto Class VIII in Hindi Medium School. Thereafter,

                   she had done her Matriculation from All India Secondary School Examination,

                   2007(C.B.S.C) with Sanskrit as a subject, and then she did her All India Senior

                   School Certificate Examination, 2009(Plus-2) (C.B.S.C.) again with Sanskrit as

                   the core subject along with other subjects. She was pursuing B.Sc.(Honours) in

                   which she had a paper of Hindi Composition as compulsory paper. Noticing these

                   facts, the Tribunal held that the deletion of her name from the select list was

                   wrong and allowed her application.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                                   4. In view of the facts, as noted above, we are not inclined to stay

                   or interfere with this writ petition. The writ petition is, accordingly, dismissed.
