                        Date : 06/05/2014
                          ORAL ORDER</pre>
<p id="p_1">           (PER : HONOURABLE MS JUSTICE SONIA GOKANI)


</p><p id="p_2">1.   Aggrieved by the order dated 31.5.2011 of the

Income    Tax      Appellate        Tribunal        ("the   Tribunal"   for

short) the assessee has challenged the same by way of

present      Tax       Appeal       posing         following   substantial

questions of law for our consideration:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "(i) Whether in the facts and circumstances of
     the case the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was
     right in law in partly confirming the order of
     the CIT(A) on ground Nos.1 &amp; 3, without
     discussing the findings reached by the said
     authority, holding that there is absence of
     any evidence or material or explanation from
     the side of assessee; though the details could
     not be produced due to reasonable cause and
     even though the assessee is willing to produce
     books of accounts and details before the AO if
     the matter is remanded back to him?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     (ii) Whether in the facts and circumstances of
     the case the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was
     right in law in restoring Ground No.2 with
     regard to addition of Rs.34,94,342/- in which
     part relief was granted by the CIT(A), for

      fresh adjudication, in view of the decision on
      Revenue's appeal in ITA No.3183/Ahd/2009 for
      the same Assessment Year 2006-07?"
</blockquote>

<p id="p_3">2.    We have heard learned counsel Mr. B.S.Soparkar

for   the      appellant       and      have     examined     with   his

assistance       the       material    on      record.   Although     the

questions are more than one, essentially the single

question is in respect of the Tribunal not allowing

the request of the appellant to remand the matter to

the file of the assessing officer.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3.    It can be noticed that the assessee company for

the assessment year 2006-07 had shown the secured loan

and cash credit from the bank. The bank interest was

debited and the assessee had given substantial loan

amount to three parties on the ground that it was a

diversion     of     the     interest      bearing   funds     for   non-
</p>
<p id="p_5">business purposes, which was added by the assessing

officer.
</p>

<p id="p_6">4.    Aggrieved by the same, it was challenged by the

assessee before CIT(Appeals) and such addition was

confirmed. When the matter travelled to the Tribunal,

the Tribunal ordered thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_7">      "10. It is an admitted fact that assessee did
      not comply with the statutory notices before


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 Page 2 of 4</span>
   O/TAXAP/400/2014                      ORDER



the A.O and no details are furnished. It is
also admitted that even books of accounts were
not produced before the A.O or the Ld.CIT(A).
The Ld. Counsel for the assessee referred to
the statement of facts in which it is stated
that assessee can produce books of accounts
and other records before the A.O because the
business activity of the assessee were closed
and no details could be furnished. It is also
stated on other details, that details could be
filed and A.O could have verified the facts
from other parties. This statement of fact
would show that assessee did not produce any
details and books of accounts before the A.O.
No books of accounts and details were
furnished   before    the   Ld.CIT(A).   If  the
assessee wanted that matter may be remanded to
the file of the A.O assessee should have made
out a case on the basis of the facts available
on record but assessee did not even raised any
ground of appeal before the Tribunal and no
evidence or material is produced as to why the
assessee did not comply with the statutory
notices before the authorities below. Even
before the Tribunal the assessee did not take
any steps in bringing any evidence on record
and even no steps have been taken for
admission of the additional evidences. In the
absence of any explanation or reasons and
evidence, no case is made out for remanding
the matter to the file of the A.O on all the
grounds of appeal. The assessee throughout
remained non cooperative and did not furnish
any   evidence     or    material.    For   cash
credit/sundry creditors even no confirmation
of the parties have been filed. The ratio of
the order of the Tribunal or the High Court
could be applied if the facts are available
on record. In the absence of any facts,
details and evidences on record, no reliance
could be placed on the decision cited by the
Ld. Counsel for the assessee. Considering the
facts of the case and in the absence of any
evidence or material on record, we do not find
any justification to interfere with the orders
of the authorities below. We confirm the order
of the CIT(A) and dismiss the appeal of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                     Page 3 of 4</span>
            O/TAXAP/400/2014                                         ORDER



         assessee."
</p>

<p id="p_8">5.       We see no reason to interfere with the order of

the Tribunal. It can be noticed that the books of

accounts were neither produced before the assessing

officer nor before CIT(Appeals). The Tribunal also

noted that no steps were taken in bringing evidence on

record, even before the Tribunal and for the purpose

of   additional           evidence,      there       was      absence   of    any

application.           Such     non-cooperative            attitude     of    the

appellant        led      the    Tribunal          not   to   accede    to    the

request of the appellant. Considering these glaring

facts coupled with the fact that these findings are

completely          based       on   the      factual         matrix    and    no

perversity could be noticed in such findings which

would have given rise to substantial question of law.
</p>

<p id="p_9">6.       Tax    Appeal        resultantly           deserves       no   further

entertainment and the same is accordingly dismissed.
</p>
