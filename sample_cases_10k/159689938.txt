                          Civil Revision No.4378 of 2015(O&amp;M)
                          Date of Decision: 5.12.2016

Joginder Singh

                                              --- Petitioner


                   versus

Sukhbir Kaur alias Paramjit Kaur and others

                                              ---Respondents


Coram:      Hon'ble Mrs. Justice Rekha Mittal

Present:    Mr. Arun Takhi, Advocate
            for the petitioner

            Mr. Arnav Sood, Advocate
            for respondent Nos. 1 and 2

                   ***

<p id="p_1">            The present petition directs challenge against order dated

29.8.2014 (Annexure P-5) passed by the Civil Judge (Junior Division),

Hoshiarpur whereby suit filed by the petitioner/plaintiff has been dismissed

as withdrawn.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            The sole submission made by counsel for the petitioner is that

even if counsel for the petitioner/plaintiff had pleaded no instructions, suit

could not be dismissed as withdrawn and, at best, it could be dismissed for

non-prosecution.     It has further been argued that as counsel for the

petitioner pleaded no instructions, the Court was obligated to issue a notice

to the petitioner/plaintiff before passing an adverse order.

</p><p id="p_3">             Counsel for the respondent has not advanced any meaningful

arguments to support the order with regard to dismissal of the suit as

withdrawn.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             I have heard counsel for the parties, perused the paper book

particularly the statement of Sh. S.K.Jhamat, Advocate, counsel for the

petitioner before the trial court and order impugned.

</p><p id="p_5">             Be that as it may, it is an undisputed position of the case that

counsel for the petitioner/plaintiff got recorded his statement pleading no

instructions on behalf of the plaintiff.        However, the trial court has

dismissed the suit as withdrawn when otherwise in absence of the plaintiff

or his counsel, the Court, at best, could dismiss the suit for non-prosecution

even if the Court was of the view that no notice was required to be issued to

the party on whose behalf no instructions have been pleaded by his counsel.

In this view of the matter, the order impugned cannot be allowed to sustain

and liable to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             For the foregoing reasons, the petition is allowed, the impugned

order is set aside and the civil suit filed by the petitioner is ordered to be

revived at the Board of the trial court with a direction to proceed with the

case, in accordance with law.</p><pre id="pre_2">
