<pre id="pre_1">         THE HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE T.SUNIL CHOWDARY

                        C.R.P.No.759 of 2017

ORDER:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This revision petition is filed under Section 115 CPC assailing

the order dated 05.12.2016 passed in E.P.No.394 of 2015 in

O.S.No.458 of 2011 on the file of II Additional District Court, Ranga

Reddy District, at L.B.Nagar.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.    Heard the learned counsel appearing for both the parties and

perused the material on record.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.    The point that arises for consideration is:


</p><p id="p_6">     "Whether there is any illegality, irregularity or impropriety
     in the impugned order?"
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.    A perusal of the record reveals that the respondent filed

O.S.No.458 of 2011 against the petitioner for recovery of arrears of

rent and mesne profits. The trial Court after full fledged trial decreed

the suit in favour of the respondent and against the petitioner. The

respondent filed E.P.No.394 of 2015 in O.S.No.458 of 2011 for

attachment and sale of the movable properties in order to recover the

decretal amount.    The petitioner filed counter inter alia contending

that the movable property to be attached is the individual property of

the petitioner and not the company's movable property.


</p><p id="p_8">5.    Both counsel in all fairness submitted that the decree was

passed against M/s. SPR Publications Private Limited.       In order to

appreciate the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner,

this Court carefully perused the impugned order.          There is no

mention in para - 5 of the impugned order that the movable property

to be attached belongs to M/s. SPR Publications Private Limited -
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>


Judgment-debtor. While attaching the property, the executing Court

has to give a specific finding whether the movable property in

question belongs to the Judgment-debtor's company or it is the

personal property of the Managing Director.       The executing Court

without resolving the issue involved in the petition, simply attached

the movable properties. Viewed from factual or legal angle, the order

passed by the executing Court is not sustainable. If the order of the

executing Court is allowed to stand, certainly it would amount to

miscarriage of justice. Hence, this Court is of a considered view that

it is a fit case to remand the matter to the Executing Court for fresh

disposal.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">6.    In the result, the Civil Revision Petition is allowed setting aside

the order dated 05.12.2016 passed in E.P.No.394 of 2015 in

O.S.No.458 of 2011 and remanded to the executing Court.                The

executing Court is hereby directed to dispose of E.P.No.394 of 2015 in

O.S.No.458 of 2011 afresh, after affording a reasonable opportunity to

both the parties, in accordance with law.      The executing Court is

further directed to dispose of E.P.No.394 of 2015 as expeditiously as

possible, preferably, within a period of one month from the date of

receipt of copy of this order.   There is no order as to costs.     As a

sequel, miscellaneous petitions pending, if any, shall stand closed.
