       are common and, as such, they have been made analogous and heard

       together with the consent of the parties. The order present shall govern

       them.

<p id="p_37">                       The petitioners are the descendents of one Dhanesh Mali.

<p id="p_38">       They claim settlements of parcels of Gair Majarua Aam land

       appertaining to different plots under R.S. Khata Nos. 79 and 80 situate

       in village Gobarachh within Bhagwanpur Police Station in the district

       of Rohtas sometimes in the year 1972 vide settlement Case Nos. 48 of

       and 5 of 1972-73. On objection(s) filed by several persons, the Sub-
</p>
<p id="p_39">       Divisional Officer, Bhabhua found that the land was recorded as

       Anawad Sarva Sadharan and Anawad Bihar Sarkar in the Revisional

       Survey Records and cancelled those settlements/orders of correction of

       jamabandi. Aggrieved thereby, several writ petitions were preferred

       before this Court vide C.W.J.C. Nos. 4707, 4711, 4745, 4746, 4778

       and 4785 all of the year 1982. By a common order dated 2.4.1983

       (Annexure-9 of C.W.J.C. No. 8779 of 1988), this Court set aside those

       orders and remitted the matter back to the respondent Sub-divisional

       Officer, Bhabhua with a direction to pass fresh order(s) in accordance

       with law after hearing each of the petitioners and affording them proper

       opportunity to place their cases. The writ petitioners were, accordingly,

       directed to appear before the said respondent. In the light of the said
 Patna High Court CWJC No.8779 of 1988 dt.27-07-2012                            4




       order/direction of this Court, the respondent Sub-Divisional Officer,

       Bhabhua heard the petitioners and on a consideration of the materials

       placed before him, passed fresh order(s) for cancellation of

       jamabandi/settlement on 6.8.1983(Annexure-10 of C.W.J.C. No. 8779

       of 1988). Aggrieved thereby, the writ petitioners approached the

       respondent Collector by filing proceedings bearing Settlement Appeal

       Nos. 26 of 1983, 27 of 1983, 28 of 1983, 29 of 1983, 30 of 1983 and 31

       of 1983. Respondent Collector after hearing the parties by a common

       order dated 15.6.1987 (Annexure-11 to C.W.J.C. No. 8779 of 1988)

       dismissed the appeal(s) preferred by the petitioners. Feeling aggrieved,

       the writ petitioners filed revision applications before the respondent

       Commissioner, Patna Division vide Revision Case Nos. 116, 117, 118,

       119, 120 and 121 all of 1987. The respondent Commissioner, Patna

       Division, by a common order dated 1.12.1987 (Annexure-13 to

       C.W.J.C. No. 8779 of 1988) dismissed all the revision application

       preferred by the petitioners leading to filing of the writ petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_40">                       Heard the parties and perused the materials on record.
</p>
<p id="p_41">       While rejecting the revision applications and upholding the order of the

       Collector dated 15.6.1987, the respondent Commissioner held as under

       in paragraph 3 of the order:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                      "3. The petitioners are claiming that the lands have
                   been settled with them by the ex-landlord but S.D.O.</blockquote>
<p id="p_42">                   Bhabhua and Collector Rohtas have not accepted this
                   contention since, the Revisional survey entries are in
 Patna High Court CWJC No.8779 of 1988 dt.27-07-2012                           5




                   the name of Anabad Sarbasadharan or Anabad Bihar
                   Sarkar. They have also held that favourable orders
                   were obtained from D.C.L.R. Bhabhua/S.D.O.
                   Bhabhua by the petitioners prior to 13.10.1982 by
                   fraud. The lands in question are in common use by the
                   villagers. Some of the lands are tal and garhi and devi
                   sthan. There is also a Government Well. The
                   petitioners claim to have obtained favourable order in
                   Consolidation proceedings but copies of these orders
                   have not been produced. Even if their assertion is
                   true, the orders of D.C.L.R./S.D.O. Bhabhua prior to
                   13.10.82 in the Jamabandi Sudhar/Settlement cases
                   would necessarily have been the basis for the
                   consolidation orders, and the Consolidation orders
                   will have to be necessarily modified on the basis of
                   the order of 6.8.83 of S.D.O. Bhabhua."
</p><p id="p_43">                       Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the

       respondent had earlier accepted the claim of the petitioners of

       possession over the land in question and passed an order of

       settlement/correction of jamabandi in their names. The respondents

       were, therefore, not justified in cancelling the same subsequently. The

       petitioners have, however, not challenged the status of land as

       recorded in the Revisional Survey Khatiyan as Anawad Sarva

       Sadharan and Anawad Bihar Sarkar. It is submitted that the petitioners

       belong to weaker sections of the society and are possession of only

       small tracts of lands and, as such, they may be entitled to hold the

       same under diverse circulars of the Government and/or the provisions

       contained in Bihar Privileged Persons Homestead Tenancy Act.
</p>
<p id="p_44">                        The respondent Commissioner, on a consideration of

       materials on record, has found that orders of settlement earlier made in
          Patna High Court CWJC No.8779 of 1988 dt.27-07-2012                            6




                favour of the petitioner prior to 13.10.1982 was a result of fraud as the

                revenue records consistently indicated that the subject land was/were

                government land and in use of the villagers part of which contained tal

                (pond), Devi Asthan, Government well etc. This finding has been

                recorded by the Revisional Court on a perusal of the materials

                available on record including the findings arrived at by the Appellate

                Authority on the appeals preferred by the petitioners. This Court finds

                difficulty in interfering with those findings of fact, particularly, when

                nothing contrary to the same have been placed on record for

                consideration by the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_45">                                In view of the aforesaid, this Court finds no merit in the

                application. These are, accordingly, dismissed. This Court, however,

                observes that the dismissal of the application shall not preclude the

                petitioners from approaching the appropriate authority/forum for

                settlement of land in their favour, if they otherwise qualify therefor in

                accordance with law and the land is found suitable therefor.

<p id="p_46">                                There shall be no order as to cost(s).
