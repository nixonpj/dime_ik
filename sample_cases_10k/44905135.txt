                             JUDGMENT
</pre>


<p id="p_1">          Challenging Exts.P1, P2, P3 and P4 assessment orders

under the Kerala Value Added Tax Act (the Act), the petitioner

preferred Exts.P5, P6, P7 and P8 appeals               before the second

respondent. There was a delay of 49 days in filing the appeals.

Exts.P9, P10, P11 and P12 are the applications preferred by the

petitioner for condoning the delay in filing the appeals and

Exts.P13, P14, P15 and P16 are the applications preferred by the

petitioner in the appeals for stay. It is stated that proceedings

have already been initiated for realisation of the amounts

covered by the orders impugned in the appeals. The grievance

of the petitioner, in the circumstances, concerns the delay in

disposing of the appeals.

</p><p id="p_3">               2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as also

the learned Government Pleader.
</p>
<p id="p_4">               Since the delay in filing the appeals is only 49 days,

having regard to the peculiar facts of this case, I deem it

appropriate to dispose of the writ petition directing the appellate

authority to condone the delay in filing the appeals and pass

orders on the applications for stay, within one month from the

date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. Ordered accordingly.

Needless to say that till orders are passed on the applications for

stay, further proceedings for realization of the amounts covered

by the orders impugned in the appeals shall be deferred by the

respondents concerned.
