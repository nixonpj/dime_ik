<p id="p_1">                          BEFORE
      HON'BLE MR JUSTICE UMA NATH SINGH, CHIEF JUSTICE


For the Petitioners    :     Mr K Paul,
                             Mr JM Thangkhiew, Advocates

For the Respondents    :     Mr VK Jindal, Sr. Advocate
                             Mr S Jindal,
                             Ms QB Lamare, Advocates

Date of Judgment       :     07.01.2016


                       JUDGMENT AND ORDER


            Towards the order dated 16.10.2015 and 12.11.2015, the

Central Bureau of Investigation has submitted the final Enquiry Report in

CBI Case No.PE4(A)/2015-SHG (PSEHG2015A0004).             In the findings

recorded after holding a detailed preliminary enquiry, the CBI has found

inculpatory materials against the following persons namely: (1) Smti MA

Lyngdoh, Chairperson of Meghalaya Urban Development Authority (for

short MUDA); (2) Shri F War, Member; (3) Shri T Lyngwa,Member; (4) Shri

BRM Lyngdoh, Member; (5) Shri K Wahlang, Member; (6) Shri BPF

Lyngdoh,Member; (7) Shri S Shullai, Member; (8) Shri R Rymbai, Member;

and Shri LK Jyrwa, Member of MUDA, for granting permission for raising

illegal construction of high rise buildings beyond G+3. The CBI has also

found (i) Sh.S Maruf Elahi (Bivar Road, Shillong); (ii) Smti Saini Pala

(Motinagar, Shillong), (iii) Shri Nirmalendu Das, Shri Amalendu Das and

Shri Sishir Das; (iv) Shri Prakash Chand Patni (Jail Road, Shillong); (v)

Shri Kenneth Mathew Lyngdoh (Bivar Road, Shillong); (vi) Shri Sanjay

Jhunjhunwalla and Smti Sarita Jhunjhunwalla (Bivar Road, Shillong); (vii)

Shri Modrick Nongkynrih (Bishop Cotton Road, Shillong); (viii) Shri BD

Marbaniang (Mc Cabe Road, Demseiniong, Laitumkhrah, Shillong); (ix)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                         3</span>




Shri Lamboklang Mylliemngap (Motinagar, Shillong); (x) Dr (Mrs) TA

Sohkhlet (Lummawrie, Laitumkhrah, Shillong); (xi) Shri Alan Wood Swer

(Fire Brigade, Laitumkhrah, Shillong); (xii) Smti Fidelia Kharkongor Dkhar

(Kench's Trace, Shillong); and (xiii) Smti Merita Wahlang (Shri Nicholas

Wahlang, Lachaumiere, Boyce Road, Shillong); to be the beneficiaries of

the illegal permission granted by the officers of MUDA. The CBI having

collected detailed materials during inquiry has placed the report for

further order and there is an oral prayer to grant permission for

registration of case and prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.            Moreover, the case seems to be essentially based on

documentary evidence which is also extensively referred to in the

judgment dated 28.9.2015 passed by the Division Bench.           Besides, the

CBI   has   already   scanned   through     the   relevant   materials   before

pinpointing the aforesaid names, therefore, now the area of investigation

appears to be well defined.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.            It also appears that, against the judgment and order dated

28.9.2015 directing preliminary enquiry by the CBI in PIL No.1 of 2014

passed by this Court, the MUDA has filed an Special Leave Petition being

No.29379/2015, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court, while issuing notice

has declined to grant stay.     Now the decks are clear for the CBI to

prosecute the aforesaid persons. However, I would like to make it clear

that, since the CBI has already undertaken a detailed preliminary enquiry

and submitted a final preliminary report pinpointing the persons involved

in the shoddy affairs, it would be open for them to register a case and

start investigation against such persons but certainly not against any

other person who is not directly connected with the grant of permission to

raise the illegal constructions or is not a direct beneficiary of such

permission.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        4</span><p id="p_4">




</p><p id="p_5">4.           Thus, in terms of request made by the Investigating Officer

during the course of hearing, I grant the permission to CBI to register an

FIR and prosecute the aforesaid persons. However, since the subordinate

judiciary in the State of Meghalaya has been separated from the executive

very recently   and is still at formative stage, and as we have also been

noticing serious procedural errors and lack of knowledge of law in the

orders of Judicial Officers and further that, this case may require expert

handling by experienced Judicial officers, it would be expedient in the

interest of justice, and thus, I grant liberty to CBI to register the case at

their headquarters, Delhi, and seek liberty from Hon'ble the Supreme

Court, if so advised, to prosecute the aforesaid persons in a Delhi Court so

that the trial could reach the logical conclusion well within time and to the

full satisfaction of the litigants. Needless to say, that Shillong falls under

seismic Zone 5 and even very recently, on 4.1.2016, there was a major

earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale.           Thus, the grant of

permission to raise high rise buildings as well as the act of raising such

constructions in illegal manner in violation of laws governing the subject

matter have to be dealt with firmly.
</p>
<p id="p_6">3.           With the aforesaid directions and observations, this criminal

petition is disposed of.
