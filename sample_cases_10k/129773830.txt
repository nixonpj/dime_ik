     petitioner went on deputation to Government of India and thereafter 
     was sent on deputation to National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing 




                                                                               
     Federation (NAFED) as its Managing Director.  The NAFED is a national

     nodal agency for oilseeds and pulses.  Initially, NAFED was dealing with 
     the organization, promotion and development of marketing, processing 
     and storage of agricultural commodities only.   However, in September 




                                         
     2003, a decision to start dealing in non agricultural commodities was 
                         
     taken by the Business Committee of NAFED, apparently, as and by way 
     of economic necessity of the organization.  NAFED entered into public -

<p id="p_5">     private   partnership   tie-ups,   business   with   private   entrepreneurs,   in 
     bringing domestic market and international trade of agricultural and 
     non   agricultural   items   from   2003-2004   onwards.     One   business 
      


     associate of NAFED was M/s.Swarup Group of Industries, of Andheri, 
   



     Mumbai,   to   whom   NAFED   extended   facility   of   carrying   out   export 
     business   of   iron   ore.     Certain     irregularities   took   place   in   the 
     transactions between NAFED and M/s.Swarup Group of Industries. An 





     amount of Rs.235.59 Crores, approximately, was released by NAFED for 
     shipment of iron ore by M/s.Swarup Group of Industries, out of which 
     only   an   amount   of   Rs.86.06   Crores,   approximately,   was   received   by 





     NAFED, either by way of export proceeds or otherwise.  The remaining 
     amount of Rs.149.53 Crores, approximately, was allegedly diverted by 
     M/s.Swarup   Group   of   Industries   for   investment   in   properties   or 
     movable assets and was converted for the personal use of Shri Guru 
     Swarup Srivastav (accused no.1) causing wrongful loss to the tune of

     Rs.149.53   Crores,   approximately,   to   NAFED.     The   substance   of 
     allegations against the accused persons is that they had conspired to 




                                                                                
     cheat   NAFED   and   misappropriated   the   funds   of   NAFED.     That,   in 




                                                        
     furtherance   of   the   said   conspiracy,   amounts   were   disbursed   to 
     M/s.Swarup Group of Industries in an irregular manner and without 
     following   proper   procedure   and   without   taking   sufficient   security. 
</p>



                                                       
<p id="p_6">     That, false and fabricated documents were accepted and on that basis, 
     the amount was disbursed.
</p>



                                          
<p id="p_7">     5             Indeed, that the offences in question have been committed, 
                         
     cannot be doubted or disputed at this stage.   It appears that NAFED 
     was   induced   to   disburse   a   huge   amount   to   M/s.Swarup   Group   of 
                        
     Industries, on the basis of forged and false documents, submitted by 
     them.   It also cannot be doubted at this stage, that the disbursement 
     was made in an irregular way; and normal and ordinary procedural 
      


     safeguards   were   not   followed.     Infact,   that   the   commission   of   the 
   



     offences   in   question   is   prima   facie   disclosed,   is   conceded   by   the 
     petitioner.  His contention is only that there is nothing to show that he 
     has committed any offence or that he had conspired with any of the 





     other accused to defraud and cause wrongful loss to NAFED at the cost 
     of wrongful gain to M/s.Swarup Group of Industries and the accused.
</p>




<p id="p_8">     6             Before considering the contentions raised by the petitioner, 
     it would be appropriate to see what has been, infact, alleged against 
     the petitioner and then to see what is the material in the charge sheet 
     to support such an allegation.

     disburse the amount.  It is also alleged that instead of making payment

     properties at various places. The details of funds misappropriated are

     petitioner,   that   the   accusation   against   the   petitioner   is   baseless   and 
     absurd.   He submitted that the record itself indicates that actually it 




                                           
     was the petitioner who brought the matter to the notice of the CBI, 
     when he observed that several serious irregularities had taken place in 
                          
     the transactions between NAFED and M/s.Swarup Group of Industries. 
     He submitted that the petitioner is actually the "whistle blower" but 
                         
     unfortunately for him, the investigating agency thought it fit to make 
     an   accusation   against   him   also,   along   with   the   other   accused.     He 
     submitted that not only there is no material to indicate the involvement 
      


     of the petitioner in the alleged offence, but that, on the contrary, there 
   



     is sufficient material which suggests to the contrary.
</p>

<p id="p_16">     9              If the allegations against the petitioner are analyzed, they 





     are as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           i) That, though NAFED under the Bye-laws as were existing at the 
             material time, could not deal with non agricultural commodities, 





             the petitioner acted contrary to the Bye-laws, which resulted in 
             allowing  Mr.Guru Swarup Srivastav to misappropriate the funds 
             of   NAFED   in   collusion   with   the   other   accused.     Thus,   the 
             allegation is that funds of NAFED were permitted to be disbursed 
             for an unauthorized business in non agricultural commodities.

     12             There is great substance in the contention advanced by the 
     learned counsel for the petitioner.  The allegation that the accused no.2 




                                                                                   
</p><p id="p_21">     - Homi Rajvansh, committed the acts in question  without the approval 




                                                           
     of the Managing Director i.e. the petitioner and without informing him 
     and   the   allegation   that   the   Managing   Director   i.e.   the   petitioner   is 
     responsible for the said acts, cannot go hand in hand together.  Surely, if 




                                                          
     the   case   is   that  Homi   Rajvansh   committed   these   illegalities   without 
     informing   the   Managing   Director,   as   was   required   and   without   his 
     permission, as was necessary, then the responsibility of such acts (which 




                                            
     were   done   without   the   permission   of   and   the   information   to   the 
                          
     petitioner), cannot be fastened on the petitioner.  This is so obvious, that 
     it does not need any further elaboration.

<p id="p_22">     13             Mr.Vishwajit Singh further contended that the actions of the 
     petitioner indicate that he was innocent and that actually it was he, who  
      

     initiated   the   actions   against   M/s.Swarup   Group   of   Industries.     He 
     submitted that a number of actions were taken by the petitioner against 
   



     M/s.Swarup   Group   of   Industries,   which   themselves   rule   out   the 
     possibility of the applicant being in collusion with them, and / or having 





     conspired with M/s.Swarup Group of Industries and other accused.  It is 
     submitted   that   as   soon   as   the   petitioner   learnt   about   the   huge 
     disbursement of funds, and the diversion of funds by M/s.Swarup Group 
     of   Industries,   the   petitioner   immediately   secured   NAFED's   interest   by 





     mortgaging Mall and paintings of Hussain in which M/s.Swarup Group 
     of   Industries   had   diverted   the   funds.     It   is   also   submitted   that   the 
     petitioner directed a criminal complaint to be filed against M/s.Swarup 
     Group of Industries with the CBI and actually approved the filing of such  
     complaint.

     14              Interestingly, in the course of arguments, as and by way of 
</pre><p id="p_23">     reply to this contention, Mr.S.K.Shinde, the learned counsel for the CBI, 




                                                                                 
     suggested   that   directing   filing   of   a   complaint   against   M/s.Swarup 




                                                         
     Group of Industries with the CBI, was quite likely to be only an eye 
     wash.   According to Mr.S.K.Shinde, the CBI had already received an 
     anonymous   communication   informing   of   the  malpractices   and   secret 




                                                        
     inquiries into the matter were already going on.   It was suggested by 
     him that the possibility of the petitioner somehow becoming aware of 
     the same and therefore deliberately, his having directed the lodging of a 




                                           
     complaint, to show that he is not involved in the matter, could not be 
                           
     ruled   out.     This   was   however   refuted   by   Mr.Vishwajit   Singh,   by 
     submitting that the same does not appeal to reason, in as much as, the 
                          
     petitioner did not stop merely by directing a complaint to be lodged, 
     but vigorously followed up the matter.  
</p>      


<p id="p_24">     15              It may, therefore, be examined, as to what specific actions 
   



     the petitioner appears to have taken, in the matter.
</p>

<p id="p_25">           i) When  M/s.Swarup Group  of  Industries obtained a stay on the 





              investigation   into   the   First   Information   Report   (FIR)   from   the 
              Supreme   court   of   India,   the   petitioner   authorized   NAFED   to 
              intervene in the case and to get the stay order vacated.
</p>




<p id="p_26">           ii) M/s.Swarup   Group   of   Industries   had   obtained   a   release   order 
              from the court for the paintings of Hussain.  The petitioner took 
              personal   interest   and   was   able   to   save   the   paintings,   thus 
              securing the interest of NAFED.

              Mr.Homi Rajvansh - the accused no.2 and on finding him guilty, 
              suggested departmental action against him.

<p id="p_30">     That the  petitioner took, or caused to be taken these actions, is not 
                          
     disputed   before   me.     These   actions   taken   by   the   petitioner   are   not 
     consistent   with  the   theory   propounded   by  the   CBI,  namely,  that   the 
                         
     petitioner becoming aware of the possibility of he being involved in the 
     matter, took the step of directing the lodging of complaint, merely, as 
     and  by   way   of   an   attempt,   to   save   himself   from   the   suspicion,   that 
      


     could be raised against him.  
</p>   



<p id="p_31">     16              It does not appear that the petitioner just lodged a formal 
     complaint with the CBI, but it appears that he vigorously followed up 





     the   complaint   at   various   different   levels.     There   is   substance   in   the 
     contention that a person who is involved in the matter was certainly 
     not likely to insist on a thorough investigation and a quick and speedy 





     outcome of the investigation.  
</p>

<p id="p_32">     17              There is another important aspect of the matter.   There is 
     no   material   in   the   police   report   and   accompanying   documents   to 
     indicate that the petitioner made any financial gains or that he received

     any amounts or property from M/s.Swarup Group of Industries as a

     fact, there is not even an allegation to that effect.  Considering the huge 




                                                         
     amounts involved in the matter, if the petitioner would have received 
     some consideration for disbursing the amounts to M/s.Swarup Group 
     of Industries, such financial gains made by the petitioner could have 




                                                        
     been easily detected during the investigation that has been carried out. 
     Significantly, so far as the accused no.2 Homi Rajvansh is concerned, 
     the investigation could establish that he had acquired huge properties 




                                           
     from   the   ill-gotten   wealth.     The   very   fact   that   the   extensive 
                          
     investigation that has been carried out in the matter, did not provide 
     any basis  even for alleging  that the petitioner has made any financial 
                         
     gains   by   committing   the   alleged   wrongs,   needs   to   be   viewed   as   a 
     positive   factor,   showing   that   he   was  not  a   party   to   the   alleged 
     conspiracy.
</p>      
   



<p id="p_33">     18             If   the   allegations   leveled   against   the   petitioner   are 
     carefully considered, it becomes at once clear that they are basically to 
     the effect that the petitioner failed to keep a proper check over what his  





     subordinates were doing.  A reading of the allegations suggest that it is  
     on the basis that the petitioner was the Managing Director of NAFED that  
     he is sought to be made responsible for the wrongs that had indeed taken  





     place.  That the wrongs have indeed taken place and that the fraudulent 
     transactions have been entered into cannot be doubted at this stage, 
     but the question is whether there is any material in the charge sheet to  
     show that the petitioner was a party to the wrongs and had the requisite

<p id="p_34">     19             Some   contentions   have   been   raised   indicating   that   the 
     petitioner   failed   to   perform   certain   acts,   which   he   ought   to   have 
     performed, and that, in that case, the offences could not have taken 




                                           
     place or that they could not have taken place in such a big magnitude.

<p id="p_35">     This, even if is accepted as correct for the sake of arguments, would 
     not,   by itself, give rise to criminal liability.   This, at best, would give  
                         
     scope for a departmental action against the petitioner.

<p id="p_36">     20             When cheating, fraud or other offences are committed by 
   



     the officers or employees of any organization, by taking advantage of 
     their position as such, it is always easy to allege that the head of the 
     organization   is   also   involved   in   such   offences.     However,   such   an 





     allegation   cannot   be   justified   only   on   the   basis   that,   such   head   or 
     principal officer ought to have been more diligent and / or that, had he 
     acted in a particular manner, the offences would not have taken place. 
</p>




<p id="p_37">     For holding the head of such organization responsible for such offences, 
     there should be some material to show, although prima facie, that these 
     acts or  omissions could not have taken  place, unless such head was 
     involved in the conspiracy to commit such offences.

     21             The   parameters   of   criminal   liability   are   totally   different 
</pre><p id="p_38">     from   that   providing   grounds   for   an   administrative   or   departmental

     cannot be fastened on a person.   It is quite elementary that only the 
     acts  done   with  the   requisite  guilty  intention  can   constitute   offences. 
     Such   guilty   intention   must,  prima   facie,  be   indicated   from   the   acts 




                                                        
     themselves.  It is a different matter that repeated and serious omissions 
     or neglect to do an essential job or act, might create a presumption that 
     the neglect or omission was wilful; and was dishonest or fraudulent. 
</p>



                                           
<p id="p_39">     But such is not the case here.  The allegations that the petitioner acted 
                         
     contrary to the bye-laws and that the funds of NAFED were permitted 
     to   be   disbursed   for   an   unauthorized   business   in   non   agricultural 
                        
     commodities, are obviously being leveled because something wrong has 
     happened   in   the   transactions   with   M/s.Swarup   Group   of   Industries. 
     That the bye-laws were subsequently amended by permitting business 
      


     in   non   agricultural   commodities   under   the   tie-up   business,   makes   it 
   



     clear that the decision to deal in non agricultural commodities, which, 
     as aforesaid, had been taken by the Business Committee of Board of 
     NAFED, was based on the economic necessity of the organization. To 





     suggest that the motive of the petitioner in permitting dealing in non 
     agricultural   commodities   was   dishonest,   cannot   be   accepted.     Thus, 
     apart   from   the   fact   that   the   decision   to   deal   in   non   agricultural 





     commodities was not of  the  petitioner and was that of the  Business 
     Committee of NAFED, such a decision cannot be held to be sufficient to 
     attract   criminal   liability.     This   is   more   so,   when   by   subsequently 
     amending the bye-laws, dealing in non agricultural commodities was 
     made permissible.

     22             Further, the allegations leveled against the petitioner about

     no.2 Homi Rajvansh, did certain wrongs  without the permission of the  
     petitioner  and behind his back, and that the said Homi Rajvansh and 




                                                         
     the petitioner had conspired to commit the said wrongs, cannot go hand 
     in hand together.  Indeed, the allegations against the co-accused Homi 
     Rajvansh are supported by material in the charge sheet, but the very 




                                           
     absence of such material, so far as the petitioner is concerned, renders 
                          
     the   theory  of  the   petitioner   being  a  party  to   the   alleged  conspiracy, 
     unacceptable.  
</p>                         
<p id="p_41">     23             Additionally,   there   is   no   proper   explanation   of   the 
     undisputed fact of the petitioner having taken initiative in lodging the 
      


     FIR   and   requiring   investigation   into   the   matter   and   that,   he   had   at 
   



     various   stages   vigorously   followed   up   the   matter   to   ensure   that   the 
     guilty are brought to hook and prosecuted.  
</p>




<p id="p_42">     24             The collective force of all these circumstances, which are 
     either undisputed or are apparent from the record itself, leads to the 
     conclusion that, the accusation of the petitioner having committed the 





     alleged offence, is baseless.

<p id="p_43">     25             A   feeble   attempt   to   create   some   suspicion   against   the

     an   artificial   manner   by   highlighting   his   position   as   the   Managing 
     Director   of   NAFED   and   by   suggesting   that   had   he   been   diligent,   the 
                          
     offences might not have taken place.   This, even if accepted as correct
