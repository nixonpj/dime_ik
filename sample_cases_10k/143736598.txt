      HIGH COURT OF M.P. BENCH AT INDORE
 D.B. Hon'ble Justice Shri S.C. Sharma and Hon'ble
          Justice Shri Shailendra Shukla.
                      W.A. No.323 of 2019
     (Mrs. Sobhana Parmar V/s. State of M.P. &amp; Ors.)

Indore dated 15.10.2019.

        Shri L.C. Patne, Advocate for the appellant.

        Shri     V.    Gandhi,         Govt.   Advocate   for
respondents/State.

        Heard.

                             ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">PER S.C. SHARMA, J:-
</p>
<p id="p_2">        Delay, if any, is hereby condoned.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.      The present writ appeal is arising out of the order
dated 5.2.2018, passed by the learned Single Judge in
W.P.No.7817/2016 (Mrs. Sobhana Parmar V/s. State of
M.P. &amp; 2 Others.).
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.      Facts of the case reveal that the appellant before
this court has preferred the writ petition being aggrieved
by order dated 13.1.2014 by which she was granted
senior grade pay-scale and selection grade pay-scale
w.e.f. 1.4.2005 and 1.4.2012, respectively. The petition
was also against the order dated 7.9.2016. The petitioner
came up with a case that in light of the judgment
delivered in the case of Kaluram Patidar V/s. State of
M.P. &amp; Ors. (W.P. No.11064 of 2010) decided on
25.8.2016, she is entitled for grant of pay-scale in terms
of Circulars dated 16.4.2010, 19.5.2010, 14.6.2011 and
</p><p id="p_5">                           --- 2 ---     [W.A. No.323/2019]

14.9.2012, from the same date the benefit has been
extended to other identically placed persons. She was
claiming the benefit of senior grade pay-scale of Rs.3000
</p><p id="p_6">- 5000 (revised to Rs.10000 - 15200) w.e.f. 6.9.1999
and selection grade, ie., Rs.3700 - 5700 (revised to
Rs.12000-18300) w.e.f. 6.10.2004 as well as the benefit
of 5th pay band, ie., placement in the pay-scale Rs.37400
</p><p id="p_7">- 6700 + AGP of Rs.9000/- w.e.f. 6.10.2007.
</p>
<p id="p_8">4.    The respondents came up with a case that there
were two adverse ACR's of the year 2000 and 2006 and
the representations against those adverse ACR's was
rejected hence, the petitioner is not entitled for any relief.
</p>
<p id="p_9">5.    The petitioner came up with a case that at no point
of time the adverse ACR's were communicated to her
and the learned Single Judge after going through the
record and after taking into account the order passed by
the respondents dated 3.9.2001, which was in respect of
adverse ACR 2000, by which the representation against
the adverse ACR 2000 was allegedly rejected, has
dismissed the writ petition. Before this court also an
affidavit was filed by the petitioner stating categorically
that at no point of time the adverse ACRs were
communicated to the petitioner. She has never made any
representation against adverse ACR's and, therefore, this
court has directed the respondents to produce the record
relating to adverse ACR's. The record has been
produced. This court has categorically directed the
respondents/State to produce the note-sheets in respect
of 2000 ACR as well as 2006 ACR, the representation
</p><p id="p_10">                           --- 3 ---     [W.A. No.323/2019]

made by the petitioner and the order rejecting the
representations.
</p>
<p id="p_11">6.    Shri V. Gandhi, learned Govt. Advocate has
produced the record. However, fairly stated that note
sheets are not available. He has stated that the
representation in respect of adverse ACR's which was
communicated vide letter dated 9.11.2000 was rejected
on 3.9.2001. In respect of 2006 ACR, Shri Gandhi,
learned Govt. Advocate has categorically stated that
there is no representation and there is no order rejecting
the representation against the adverse ACR. However, in
the judgment delivered by the learned Single Judge a
reference finds place that representation against adverse
ACR of 2006 was rejected on 2.8.2006.
</p>
<p id="p_12">7.    Shri Gandhi, learned Govt. Advocate has clarified
the issue and his contention is that the order rejecting the
representation     against    the     adverse   ACR      was
communicated vide letter dated 4.11.2006 and the
adverse ACR of 2006 was communicated vide letter
dated 2.8.2006.
</p>
<p id="p_13">8.    Undisputedly, the respondents/State has not able to
establish that the adverse ACR's were communicated to
the petitioner at any point of time. It is really strange that
the respondents do have some letters in the file in respect
of communication of adverse ACR's, but file does not
contain the representations of the petitioner. This itself
speaks volumes about the conduct of the State
Government. The documents which are conducive to the
</p><p id="p_14">                                   --- 4 ---       [W.A. No.323/2019]

State Government have been shown to this court and the
documents which might create a case in favour of the
petitioner, on the basis of which the petitioner is entitled
for relief have been deliberately suppressed by the State
of Madhya Pradesh. As the respondents have not been
able to establish before this court that the adverse ACR's

were communicated to the petitioner, at any point of
time, the question of taking into account the adverse
ACR's of the year 2000 and 2006, while considering the
case of the petitioner for grant of the up-gradation
doesn't arise.
</p>
<p id="p_15">9.    The Division Bench of this court while deciding
the State appeal preferred by the State Government ie.,
W.A.No.310/2019 (State of M.P. &amp; Ors. V/s. Dr. Jyoti
Viadya) in paragraphs 4 to 8 has held as under :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "4.Undisputedly, none of the average ACR was
      communicated to the sole respondent - Smt.
      Jyoti Vaidya.

Scale Rs. 37400-67000 + AGP Rs 9000 from
24.12.2012 to 01.04.2013 on the ground that ACR's
of petitioner in the years 1992-1996,1999 and 2000
are not up to the bench mark.
</p>
<p id="p_18">4.On notice,    respondents/State has submitted
counter affidavit, inter-alia contending that the
ACRs of the petitioner since the year 1990 till the
year 2000 have constantly been 'average' in nature
and as she did not touch the 'benchmark', therefore,
she has been rightly denied the benefits as claimed
by her from the dates as aforesaid.
</p>
<p id="p_19">5. Shri Patne, learned counsel for the petitioner has
made the following submissions:
</p>
<p id="p_20">(i)     ACR's of the years in which petitioner was
awarded 'average' grading could not have been
made the basis for denial of benefit of pay scales
from the due dates since those gradings were never
communicated     to    her    enabling   her   to    file
representations against the same .(ii) under similar
facts and circumstances,the co-ordinate Bench
decided writ petition no. 15206/2008 by order dated
30.11.2009(Dr. M.K. Richariya Vs. State of
M.P.)which was affirmed by the Division Bench in
W.A . No. 310/2011 on 24.08.2011.(iii) further,W.P.
No. 11064/2010(S) (Kaluram Patidar Vs. State of
M.P. &amp; Ors.)was decided on 25.08.2011 by relying
upon the judgment rendered in Dr. M.K. Richariya's
case (supra), wherein it has been ruled that un-
communicated ACR's           comingin    the   way    of
petitioner in the matter of grant of pay scale from
due dates, could not have been acted upon to justify
denial. The Court has further directed that those
ACRs be ignored while considering the claim of the
petitioner for grant of benefit of pay scales on due
dates. The controversy involved in this case is also
similar thereto. Hence, the order and directions
</p><p id="p_21">                         --- 6 ---          [W.A. No.323/2019]

   issued thereunder shall apply mutatis mutandis to
   the facts of the case in hand.
</p>
<p id="p_22">   (iv) learned counsel for the petitioner also refers to
   the Three Judge Bench judgment of the Hon'ble
   Supreme Court rendered in the case of Sukhdev
   Singh Vs. Union of India]reported in (2013) 9 SCC
   566, approving the two Judge Bench judgment
   rendered in the case of Devdutt Vs. Union of India
   &amp; Ors. reported in (2008) 8 SCC 725 , to contend
   that even if the ACR of a given period may not be
   adverse and irrespective of nature of remark, if such
   remarks come in the way of grant of higher pay
   scale, then the same are to be treated as 'adverse'
   and unless, the same is communicated to the
   delinquent    with    an    opportunity     to    make
   representation against the same, such remark cannot
   be acted upon.(v) it is further submitted that in the
   aforesaid two judgments(supra), Hon'ble Supreme
   Court has also approved that;(i)whether remark is
   'poor', 'fair', 'average','good' or 'very good', every
   entry in the ACR may be communicated to the
   delinquent giving him/her an opportunity to improve
   his/her work and give better results, (ii) to afford
   him/her opportunity to make representation for
   upgradation and (iii)communication of every entry
   in the ACR brings transparency in recording
   remarks in the service book of the public servant. As
   such, the petitioner is entitled for grant of benefit of
   Senior Grade Pay Scale Rs. 10000-15200, Selection
   Grade Pay Scale Rs. 12000-18300 and the benefit of
   Pay Band-IV i.e. placement in the pay scale of Rs.
   37400-67000+Rs 9000 AGP from the due dates.
</p>
<p id="p_23">6. Per contra, Shri Gajankush, learned Dy. Advocate General
tried to controvert the aforesaid contentions andattempted to
distinguish the judgments cited with the contention that in
the instant case, petitioner has all along been graded as
'average' since the year 1990 till the year 2000,unlike cases
</p><p id="p_24">                          --- 7 ---         [W.A. No.323/2019]

cited above decided by Co-ordinate Bench wherein only two
or three remarks were 'average'. Under such circumstances,
if a person since long span of period has been rated
'average', such grading by itself can be categorized as
'adverse' only for the reason that petitioner could not satisfy
the 'benchmark' for grant of benefits of pay scale from due
dates as claimed. On the same touchstone,petitioner's case is
sought to be distinguished from the judgments of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Sukhdev Singh(supra) and
Devdutt (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_25">7. Heard.
</p>
<p id="p_26">8.There is no cavil of doubt that 'every entry in the ACR of
a public servant' is required to be communicated as held by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Devdutt's case
(supra). But in Sukhdev Singh's case(supra), the Hon'ble
Supreme Court has approved the said judgment with further
justification as contained in para 8 thereof:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     8.In our opinion, the view taken in Dev Dutt that
     every entry in ACR of a public servant must be
     communicated to him/her within a reason able
     period is legally sound and helps in achieving
     threefold objectives. First, the communication of
     every entry in the ACR to a public servant helps
     him/her to work harder and achieve more that helps
     him in improving his working and give better results.
     Second and equally important, on being made aware
     of the entry in the ACR, the public servant may feel
     dissatisfied with the same. Communication of the
     entry enables him/her to make representation for
     upgradation of there marks entered in the ACR.
     Third, communication of every entry in the ACR
     brings transparency in recording the remarks
     relating to a public servant and the system becomes
     more conforming to the principles of natural justice.
     We accordingly, hold that every entry in ACR poor,
     fair, average, good or very good - must be
     communicated to him/her within a reasonable
     period.

learned Dy. Advocate General pales into insignificance and
of no consequence.

 identical circumstances in the case of Ddr. M.K.
 Richariya V/s. State of M.P. passed in
 W.P.No.15206/2008, decided on 30.11.2009.
 The aforesaid case was again taken in scrutiny
 by the Division Bench and the Division Bench
 has dismissed the writ appeal filed by the
 StateGovernment by an order dated 24.8.2011,
</p><p id="p_29">                           --- 9 ---      [W.A. No.323/2019]

       matter,i.e.,in W.P.No.11064/2010(s) (Kaluram
       PatidarV/s. State of M.P. &amp;Ors.) again a similar
       view has been taken and it has been held that
       uncommunicated ACR's, coming in the way of
       an employee in the matter of grant of pay -
       scale from due dates cannot be looked into. Not
       only this, again a similar view has been taken by
       the Division Bench of this court in the case of
       State of M.P. &amp; 2 Ors. V/s.Smt. Kavita Bundela,
       passed inW.A.No.7978/2016(s), decided on
       23.10.2017.
</p><p id="p_30">       7. In light of the aforesaid, this court is of the
       opinion that the learned Single Judge was
       justified in allowing the writ petition.
       Undisputedly, the ACR's have never been
       communicated to the petitioner and they have
       been looked into while denying the benefit to
       the respondent of up-gradation / grant of higher
       pay - scale from the due date.
</p><p id="p_31">       8. Hence, no case for interference is made out in
       the matter

</p><p id="p_32">10.   In the light of the aforesaid judgment as the
adverse ACR's were not communicated to the petitioner,
the order passed by the learned Single Judge is set aside.
The writ appeal is allowed.

<p id="p_33">11.   The respondents are directed to reconsider the case
of the petitioner, ignoring the ACR's of the year 2000
and 2006 as well as all those ACR's which were never
communicated to the petitioner, for the purpose of grant
of senior scale, selection grade as well as pay band IV.
The exercise of considering the case of the petitioner

period of 3 months and the respondents shall also confer
all the consequential benefits to the petitioner within the
aforesaid period.
