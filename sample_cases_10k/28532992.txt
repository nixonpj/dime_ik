</p><p id="p_4">3.               It is further stated that the petitioner is having two Ph.D, one in 

   Behavioral   Science   and   another   Ph.D   in   International   Business   and 

   presently the petitioner is holding the Post of Director General, Consultancy, 

   Development Centre, Ministry of Science and Technology, Govt. of India 

   and shall retire on 31st  April, 2011 on attaining the age of superannuation 

   from   the   said   post.   It   is   further   stated   that   the   petitioner   is   a   certified 

   management   consultant   with   over   35   years   of   experience   in   teaching, 

   industries   and   consultancy   and   after   retirement   from   the   services,   the 

   petitioner is intending to set up a multi­service/disciplinary, management

    dependent   upon   the   petitioner   for   the   same   and   would   be   joining   the 

   petitioner in the proposed Management Consultancy Services firm.  

</p><p id="p_5">4.                It is further stated that petitioner requires approximately 900 sq. 

   feet area to set up the business of Management Consultancy, but except the 

   tenanted premises and another shop adjacent to the tenanted premises i.e 

   Shop No. 27­B, no other space is available to the petitioner from where the 

   petitioner   can   establish   and   operate   his   Management   Consultancy   Firm. 

   Therefore, the tenanted premises under the possession of the respondents is 

   bonafide  required   by   the   petitioner  for  himself  as  well   as  for  his  family 

   members i.e. his sons who are totally dependent upon the petitioner. It is 

   further averred that the petitioner and his family are permanently residing 

   on the first and second floor of the property No. M­27, Greater Kailash­I, 

   New Delhi and it will be convenient for the petitioner to set up his multi­

   disciplinary   Management   Constancy   services   on   the   ground   floor  of   the 

   same   building.   Hence,   the   present   petition.   It   has   been   prayed   that   an 

   eviction   order  may   be  passed  in favour  of  the  petitioner  and against  the 

   respondents in respect of the suit premises. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.               It is pertinent here to mention that although, the leave to defend 

   application has been filed by the respondents no. 1 to 5, but the affidavit has 

   been filed by respondent no. 1 only. As per section 25­B (4) of DRC Act, 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Eviction Petition No. E-84/10                                                       Page 4 of 36</span>
    "the tenant on whom the summons is duly served (whether in the ordinary  

   way or by registered post) in the form specified in the Third Schedule shall  

   not   contest   the   prayer   for   eviction   from   the   premises   unless   he   files   an  

   affidavit stating the grounds on which he seeks to contest the application for  

   eviction and obtains leave from the Controller as hereinafter provided; and  

   in default of his appearance in pursuance of the summons or his obtaining  

   such   leave,   the   statement   made   by   the   landlord   in   the   application   for  

   eviction shall be deemed to be admitted by the tenant and the applicant  

   shall be entitled to an order for eviction on the ground aforesaid."  Since, 

   there is no affidavits of the respondents no. 2 to 5 along with the leave to 

   defend application, which is required to be filed as per provisions of section 

   25­B   (4)   of   DRC   Act,     the   leave   to  defend   application   filed   along  with 

   affidavit of respondent no. 1 cannot be considered to be filed by respondents 

   no. 2 to 5 also.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.               It   is   also   pertinent   here   to   mention   that   initially   the   petitioner 

   impleaded the respondent no. 6 in the array of the parties, who has also filed 

   his leave to defend application. But, an application u/o 1 rule 10 (2) CPC 

   was moved by the petitioner seeking deletion of name of the respondent no. 

   6  from  the  array   of   the  parties. It  was stated in the application that  the 

   petitioner had arrayed the respondent no. 6 as sub­tenant of respondent no. 1 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Eviction Petition No. E-84/10                                                              Page 5 of 36</span>
    to   5,   but   the   respondents   no.   1   to   5   have   denied   the   same   and   have 

   contended that the respondent no. 6 is their employee and not a sub­tenant in 

   the suit premises, then the respondent no. 6 has no tenancy rights in the 

   premises   and   as   such   the   petitioner   seeks   to   strike   out   the   name   of 

   respondent no. 6 from the array of the parties. The respondent no. 6 has also 

   stated in his affidavit filed along with leave to defend application that he has 

   no tenancy rights in the tenanted premises and he is an employee of the 

   respondents no. 1 to 5 employed as cashier­cum­manager in the shop. The 

   application u/o 1 rule 10 (2) CPC was allowed vide order dated 27.04.2011 

   and the name of respondent no. 6 was deleted from the array of the parties.

</p><p id="p_8">7.               In his affidavit to leave to defend application, it is contended by 

   the respondent no. 1 that present petition has been filed just to harass the 

   respondents and force them either to vacate the tenanted shop or to bow 

   down  to  the illegal  demand  of enhancement  of  rent. It is stated that  the 

   petitioner had threatened the respondents that in case the respondents do not 

   increase the rent and agree to pay a sum of Rs. 50,000/­ to Rs. 55,000/­ p.m., 

   he shall make sure that they are thrown out/evicted. It is further stated that 

   petitioner had earlier filed an eviction petition u/s 14 (1) (a), (b) and (j) of 

   DRC Act purported to have been filed by his father but actually filed by the 

   petitioner as an alleged attorney and to create false grounds, the petitioner 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Eviction Petition No. E-84/10                                                        Page 6 of 36</span>
    had refused to accept rent and had alleged sub­letting by the respondents no. 

   1 to 5 who are in possession and control of the tenanted shop and had also 

   alleged   substantial   damage   to   the   tenanted   premises.   The   said   eviction 

   petition is pending in the court of Sh. Sandeep Yadav, RC (South), Saket 

   Courts, New Delhi and the respondents no. 1 to 5 are also contesting the 

   same. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.               It is further contended by the respondent no. 1 that petitioner has 

   no bonafide requirement of the tenanted premises either for himself or for 

   his   two   sons   as   the   petitioner   has   made   vague   allegations   regarding   the 

   purported   need   of   the   tenanted   premises   i.e.   alleged   Management 

   Consultancy,   without   specifying   as   to   what   Management   Consultancy 

   business, the petitioner propose to start or the nature of the same that the 

   petitioner intends to embark on and how the tenanted premises are necessary 

   for the same. It is further stated that the field in which the petitioner alleges 

   himself to be competent is entirely different from the areas in which his sons 

   have   allegedly   got   post   doctoral   degree   or   M.Sc.   Degree   and   even   the 

   qualifications of the sons of the petitioner, though not admitted are also in 

   different areas and totally unrelated to each other. It is further stated that the 

   petitioner has no intention to start any Management Consultancy business 

   either by himself or along with two sons as there is nothing on record to 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">Eviction Petition No. E-84/10                                                        Page 7 of 36</span>
    substantiate the false alleged business and the requirement of the tenanted 

   shop. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.               The respondent no. 1 has further contended that the petitioner has 

   concealed the accommodation available with him on the ground floor as 

   well as first and second floor of the property bearing No. M­27, Greater 

   Kailash­I, Main Market, New Delhi. It is stated that the petitioner has over 

   450 sq. feet area available on the ground floor of the said property behind 

   the tenanted shop as well as the adjoining shop bearing No. M­27B and over 

   2000 sq. ft. area on the first and second floor of the said property. It is 

   further stated that the petitioner has not shown the entire dimensions of the 

   property nor shown the dimensions or area of the first and second floor of 

   the property under his possession in the site plan filed by him. It is further 

   stated that the petitioner has also deliberately suppressed the fact that in the 

   rear portion of the property M­27, Greater Kailash­I, Main Market, New 

   Delhi, there are two shops along with open area.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.                It has been denied that the petitioner along with his family is 

   residing on the first and second floor of the aforesaid property. It is stated 

   that   the   petitioner   is   residing   in   his   own   flat   bearing   No.   A­401,   C­Dot 

   Group   Housing   Society,   Sector­56 (Gurgaon) and the petitioner's vehicle 

   bearing   No.   HR   26AV   8083   is   also   registered   at   the   said   address.   It   is 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">Eviction Petition No. E-84/10                                                          Page 8 of 36</span>
    further stated that the petitioner also has a residential property bearing plot 

   No. 1, Block­B, Sector­19, Noida. 
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.              It is further stated that the property No. M­27, Greater Kailash­I, 

   Main Market, New Delhi is situated in one of the well known markets in 

   South   Delhi   and   in   fact,   the   entire   market   known   as   M­Block   Market 

   commercial activity is being carried out not only from the shops on the 

   ground floor but also from the first and second floor. In fact in the entire 

   market, the ground floor is being used specially the shops in front like the 

   tenanted   shop   are   being   used   only   for   running   retail 

   outlets/shops/restaurants and the offices, if any are situated only on first or 

   second floor. Therefore, the allegation of the petitioner of using the ground 

   floor as an office is malafide and the present petition has been filed merely 

   to evict the respondent and sell the tenanted shop or let out for a retail outlet. 

   It is further stated that the petitioner has suppressed the existence of yet 

   another shop in the rear portion known as M­27D, Greater  Kailash­I, Main 

   Market, New Delhi and it has not been shown in the site plan how the rear 

   portion is to be used if the petitioner intended starting his business from the 

   shop in front.

   employed in USA and working in Data Mining Lab, Computer Department, 

   University of Texas, Dallas, USA and he has also acquired a property in

   falsely averred that he is retiring on 31.04.2011. It is stated that the petitioner 

   had sought an extension of his service and same has been granted to the 

   petitioner. It is further stated that the petitioner has also applied to various

    has been impleaded in the array of the parties as respondent who has no 

   tenancy   rights   in   the   suit   premises.   It   is   further   contended   that   present 

   petition is also liable to be dismissed for non­joinder of necessary parties as 

   late Sh. Dhanpat Rai had left behind not only his widow and respondents no. 

   1 to 5 as his legal heirs but had also left a son Sh. Ramesh Kumar Gupta 

   who had died after the death of late Sh. Dhanpart Rai. It is stated that after 

   the death of Sh. Ramesh Kumar Gupta, the tenancy rights also devolved on 

   his widow Smt. Sudha Gupta and his daughters namely Ms. Bhavna Gupta, 

   Ms. Sumita Gupta, Ms. Ruchika Gupta and his son Sh. Bharat Gupta. The

   heirs of Sh. Ramesh Kumar Gupta in the present petition.

   plan   and   has   not   shown   the   true   extent   and   dimensions   of   the   tenanted 

   premises. It is stated that the tenanted shop also comprised of a store/box 

   room at the rear and a passage leading to the same, which the petitioner has 

   not shown in the site plan and as such the present petition   has been filed 

   only   for   part   of   the   tenanted   premises   and   not   for   the   entire   tenanted 

   premises and is thus not maintainable.   It is stated that there are several 

   triable issue which require trial, and, therefore, the respondent no. 1 has 

   prayed for grant of leave to contest the petition.

   petition. It is stated that the earlier eviction petition on the grounds of sub­

   letting and damages to the demised property u/s 14 (1) (a), (b) and (j) of 

   DRC act was filed by his father late Sh. D.P. Abrol as owner of the property

   the petitioner has been substituted as legal heir and successor and the said 

   eviction   petition   is   still   pending  in  the   court  of   Sh.  Sandeep  Yadav,  RC

   petitioner on the ground of bonafide requirement because he is presently the 

   owner   of   the   property   and   he   needs   the   premises   for   his   bonafide 

   requirement   as   he   is   retiring   on   30.04.2011   from   Govt.   service   and   the

   The covered/carpet area available on the fist floor is around 90 sqm. (900 

   sq.ft.), while on the second floor it is around 70 sqm. (700 sq. ft.). It is 

   further stated that the petitioner does not have any commercial space on the

   is not in possession of shop bearing No. 27­B and same is in possession of 

   another tenant against whom the petitioner has filed the separate eviction 

   petition. It has also been denied that there are two shops in the rear portion 

   of the building which are in possession of the petitioner. It is stated that the 

   shop No. M­27 (e) having an area of around 120 sq. ft. has been rented out 

   to Madan Gopal Singh and Shop No. M­27 D having an area of only around 

   60 sq. ft. is used for dumping waste material. It is further stated that the 

   entire area in the back portion as per sanctioned plan was an open verandah

   Gurgaon and the aforesaid residential flat at Gurgaon has been rented out. 

   The other contents of the leave application are stated to be wrong and denied

    the parties is concerned.   However, the respondent no. 1 has contended in 

   leave   to   defend   application   that   petitioner   had   earlier   filed   an   eviction 

   petition u/s 14 (1) (a), (b) and (j) of DRC Act purported to have been filed 

   by his father but actually filed by the petitioner as an alleged attorney on the 

   false ground of  non­payment of rent, sub­letting and substantial damage to 

   the tenanted premises which is pending in the court of Sh. Sandeep Yadav, 

   RC (South), Saket Courts, New Delhi and the respondents no. 1 to 5 are also 

   contesting the same. In this regard, the petitioner has categorically stated in 

   the counter affidavit that said petition  u/s 14 (1) (a), (b) and (j) of DRC Act 

   was filed by father of the petitioner late Sh. D.P. Abrol as owner of the 

   property and after the death of Sh. D.P. Aborl and his wife Smt. Swarn Lata 

   Abrol,   the   petitioner   has   been   substituted   as   legal   heir   and   successor, 

   whereas the present petition has been filed by the petitioner on the ground 

   of bonafide requirement because he is presently the owner of the property 

   and he needs the premises for his bonafide requirement as he is retiring on 

   30.04.2011 from Govt. service.

<p id="p_24">22.              In   view   of   above,   it   is   not   in   dispute   that   the   earlier   eviction

   petitioner late Sh. D.P. Abrol on the ground of non­payment of rent, sub­

   section 25­B of DRC Act on the ground of bonafide requirement of the suit 

   premises and filing of the earlier petition  by the father of the petitioner has 

   no bearing on the present petition which has been filed on the ground of 

   bonafide requirement of the suit premises and it cannot be said that present 

   petition has been filed with malafide intention as earlier eviction petition 

   filed by father of the petitioner u/s 14 (1) (a), (b) and (j) of DRC Act is still 

   pending. 
</p>
<p id="p_25">23.              Next contention of the respondent no. 1 is that petitioner has no 

   bonafide requirement of the tenanted shop either by himself or for his two 

   sons as the petitioner has only alleged that he wants the tenanted premises 

   for Management Consultancy without specifying as to what Management 

   Consultancy  business  the petitioner propose to start  or the nature of  the 

   alleged   need   for   running   the   Management   Consultancy   and   how   the 

   tenanted premises are necessary for the same. It is further contended that the 

   field in which the petitioner alleges himself to be competent   is entirely 

   different from the areas in which his sons have allegedly got post doctoral 

   degree   or   M.Sc.   Degree   and   even   the   qualifications   of   the   sons   of   the 

   petitioner,   though   not   admitted   are   also   in   different   areas   and   totally 

   unrelated to each other.

</p><p id="p_27"> 24.              On the other hand, it is categorical case of the petitioner  that he is 

   having   2   Ph.D,   one   in   Behavioural   Science   and   another   Ph.D   in 

   International Business and presently holding the Post of Director General, 

   Consultancy,   Development   Centre,   Ministry   of   Science   and   Technology, 

   Govt. of India and shall retire on 3oth April, 2011 on attaining the age of 

   superannuation from the said post. It is further case of the petitioner that he 

   is a certified management consultant with over 35 years of experience in 

   teaching, industries and consultancy and after retirement from the services, 

   he   is   intending   to   set   up   a   multi­service/disciplinary,   management 

   consultancy firm to provide services to corporate clients and therefore, he 

   requires the suit premises bonafide as he has no other commercial space 

   available to him.

<p id="p_28">25.              In   support   of   his   contention   the   petitioner   has   also   placed   on

   Institute of Foreign Trade and Delhi University and photocopy of certificate 

   issued by The Institute of Management Consultants of India. The petitioner 

   has also placed on record the cover of the book titled as "Selecting and  

   Getting Best out of Consultant" published by him.  The aforesaid documents 

   placed on record by the petitioner clearly show that the petitioner has good 

   experience in Management Consultancy. Further, there is no dispute that the

    petitioner   is   employed   as   Director   General,   Consultancy   Development 

   Centre,   Department   of   Scientific   and   Industrial   Research,   Ministry   of 

   Science and Technology, Govt. of India. As such it cannot be said that the 

   petitioner has no intention to start any Management Consultancy business. 

</p><p id="p_29">26.               So far the nature of the Management Consultancy to be set up by 

   the   petitioner   is   concerned,   the   petitioner   has   categorically   stated   in   the 

   petition   itself   that   he   is   intending   to   set   up   a   multi­service/disciplinary 

   management consultancy firm to provide services to corporate clients after 

   retirement from the Govt. Service on 30.04.2011. As such, there is no merit 

   in the contention of the respondent that the petitioner has not disclosed the 

   nature of the Management Consultancy which he wants to set up in the suit 

   premises.   Moreover, it has been held in "Balwant Singh Chaudhary and  

   Anothers  Vs.  Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited 2004 (1) RCR  

   487"  that,  "It   is   not   necessary   for   the   landlord   to   plead   and   prove   the

   30.04.2011 and in fact the petitioner had sought an extension of his service 

   and same has been granted to the petitioner, but except taking a bald plea,

    nothing has been placed on record by the respondent to show that extension 

   of service had been sought by the petitioner and same has also been granted 

   to the petitioner. On the other hand, petitioner has categorically denied in 

   the counter affidavit that neither he has applied for extension of his tenure in 

   the present job nor the same has been granted to him. The petitioner has also 

   placed   on   record   the   certificate   dated   06.12.2010   issued   by   Consultancy 

   Development  Centre in  which it has been certified that  Dr. Sunil  Abrol, 

   Director   General,   Consultancy   Development     Centre,   Department   of 

   Scientific   and   Industrial   Research,   Ministry   of   Science   and   Technology, 

   Govt. of India will be attaining the age of superannuation on 30.04.2011 and 

   would   consequently   be   retiring/superannuating   from   Consultancy 

   Development   Centre   w.e.f.   30.04.2011.   Hence,   there   is   no   merit   in   the 

   contention of the respondent that petitioner has been granted extension  of 

   the service.

<p id="p_31">28.              It is also contended by the respondent  that the petitioner has also 

   applied to various institutions and universities for employment as teacher 

   and is also looking for job opportunities in USA to settle down there along 

   with his son, which has been denied by the petitioner. But, again nothing has 

   been placed on record by the respondent to substantiate his plea and in the 

   absence   of   any   material   on   record,   the   aforesaid   vague   plea   of   the

    respondent is not tenable. 
</p>
<p id="p_32">29.              The respondent has also taken a plea that the field in which the 

   petitioner   alleges  himself   to  be competent    is entirely different  from  the 

   areas in which his sons have allegedly got post doctoral degree or M.Sc. 

   Degree and even the qualifications of the sons of the petitioner, though not 

   admitted are also in different areas and totally unrelated to each other. It is 

   also contended by the respondent that both the sons of the petitioner are 

   residing in USA and have acquired the properties and are also employed 

   there and as such they have no intention to return to India. 

</p><p id="p_33">30.              In the counter affidavit, the petitioner has contended that his son 

   has neither purchased any flat in USA nor is a permanent employee of any 

   company. It is also stated that his son Siddharth Abrol is a post Doctoral 

   researcher from the University of Delware, USA since 01.02.2010 and his 

   appointment for a period of one year is going to expire on 01.01.2011. The 

   another son namely Satyen Abrol is a Ph.D student in the Department of 

   Computer   Science,   University   of   Texas   at   Dallas,   USA   and   shall   be 

   returning to India after completing his Ph.D. 
</p>
<p id="p_34">31.              In   support   of   his   contention,   the   petitioner   has   also   placed   on 

   record   letter   dated   21.01.2010   issued   from   the   Department   of   Chemical 

   Engineering,   University   of   Delaware   which   goes   to   show   that   Siddharth

    Abrol has been offered an appointment at  a post of Doctoral Researcher 

   w.e.f. 01.01.2010 for one year which is renewable. The petitioner has also 

   placed on record a letter from Department of  Computer Science, University 

   of  Texas at Dallas, which goes to show that Satyen Abrol has been admitted 

   to the graduate programme.
</p>
<p id="p_35">32.              In view of above, it is evident that one of the son of the petitioner 

   is studying in graduate programme and another son has been appointed for 

   one year as Post Doctoral Researcher. There is nothing on record to show 

   that aforesaid sons of the petitioner have got their own property in USA 

   which   has   been   also   denied   by   the   petitioner.   Even   if   for   the   sake   of 

   arguments, the contention of the respondent is accepted that the aforesaid 

   sons of the petitioner are well settled in USA and they have no intention to 

   return back to India, still it does not vitiate the bonafide requirement of the 

   petitioner   of   the   suit   premises.   Because   the   case   of   the   petitioner   is 

   categorical that  since he is retiring from the Govt. Services on 30.04.2011 

   from the post of Director General, Consultancy Development Centre  in the 

   Govt. of India, he wants to set up his own consultancy business in the suit 

   premises after his retirement apart from the fact that both the sons of the 

   petitioner who are pursuing their studies at USA would be joining in the 

   proposed management consultancy services firm.

   Kailash­I, Main Market, New Delhi. It is contended that  the petitioner has 

   over 450 sq. feet area available on the ground floor of the said property 

   behind the tenanted shop as well as the adjoining shop bearing No. M­27B 

   and over 2000 sq. ft. area on the first and second floor of the said property. 

   It is also contended that the petitioner has also deliberately suppressed the 

   fact that in the rear portion of the property M­27, Greater Kailash­I, Main 

   Market, New Delhi, there are two shops along with open area. The petitioner 

   has suppressed the existence of shop in the rear portion known as M­27D,

   the site plan how the rear portion is to be used if the petitioner intended 

   starting his business from the shop in front.

   is further stated that the shop No. M­27 (e) having an area of around 120 sq.

   an area of only around 60 sq. ft. is used for dumping waster material. It is 

   also averred that the entire area in the back portion as per sanctioned plan 

   was an open verandah which has been declared by MCD on 07.04.2003 as 

   unauthorized construction and same cannot be used for setting up a world 

   class management consultancy firm.

<p id="p_39">35.              In the rejoinder affidavit, the respondent no. 1 has contended that 

   the allegation regarding shop No. M­27 (e) being rented out to the alleged 

   Madan Gopal Singh is false. It is stated that there is no such shop  numbered 

   as M­27 (e) and in fact a shop bearing No. 27C was let out to Madan Gopal 

   and   the   petitioner   has   already   obtained   an   eviction   order   on   the   false

   tenanted   premises.   As   per   the   site   plan  filed  by  the   petitioner   shop   No. 

   M­27A is the suit shop. So far the adjoining shop bearing no. M­27B is 

   concerned, the petitioner has categorically stated that the said shop is in

   separate eviction petition. The respondent has not controverted the said fact 

   in the rejoinder affidavit that the shop No. M­27­B is not in possession of 

   the petitioner and same is in possession of another tenant. As such, the said 

   shop No. M­27B is not available to the petitioner.

<p id="p_41">37.              So far the another shop bearing No. M­27 C is concerned, the 

   petitioner has stated in the counter affidavit that the said shop is measuring 

   120   sq.   ft.   and   has   been   rented   out   to   Madan   Gopal   Singh,   though   the 

   petitioner has mentioned the said shop as M­27 (e) in the counter affidavit, 

   but the said shop has been shown as M­27C in the site plan filed by the 

   petitioner. In the rejoinder affidavit, the respondent no. 1 has also stated that 

   the said shop No. M­27C was let out to one Sh. Madan Gopal Singh and 

   petitioner has already obtained an eviction order on the false grounds of 

   requirement of the petitioner's mother in respect of the said shop. As such, 

   as per the respondent himself the  eviction order has been passed in respect 

   of the said shop  for the requirement of the petitioner's mother and not for 

   the requirement of the petitioner. Moreover, the respondent has not disputed 

   the size of the said shop to be 120 sq. ft. which is not sufficient for the 

   proposed   business   of   Management   Consultancy   to   be   set   up   by   the 

   petitioner.   Hence,   the   said   shop   bearing   No.   M­27C   will   not   serve   any

<p id="p_42">38.              Regarding the shop No. M­27 D, the petitioner has categorically 

   stated in the counter affidavit that the said shop No. M­27D is having an 

   area of only 60 sq. ft. and is used for dumping waste material. It is also 

   stated by the petitioner that earlier it was an open verandah, which has been 

   declared   by   MCD   on   07.04.2003 as  unauthorized  construction  and same 

   cannot be used for setting up a world class management consultancy firm. 

   The petitioner has also placed on record the copy of declaration of MCD 

   dated   31.07.2005   by   which   the   open   verandah   has   been   declared   as 

   unauthorized construction. Although, the respondent has disputed the same, 

   but even for the sake of arguments if it is assumed that the said shop bearing 

   No. M­27D is available to the petitioner, still the size of the said shop is only 

   60 sq. ft. and same cannot be said to be sufficient for the proposed business 

   to be set up by the petitioner which is presently used for dumping the waste

   available to the petitioner at the ground floor of the property bearing No.

    on the ground floor is not tenable.  So far the contention of the respondent 

   no. 1 that petitioner is having over 2000 sq. ft. area available at the first and 

   second   floor   of   the   said   property   is   concerned,   the   petitioner   has 

   categorically stated in the petition itself that the petitioner and his family are 

   permanently residing on the first and second floor of the property bearing 

   No. M­27, Greater Kailash­I, New Delhi where they have been residing for 

   last 30 years. In this regard, the petitioner has also placed on record the 

   photocopy of his passport and photocopy of Identity Card of his wife Smt. 

   Saroj   Abrol,   who   is   employed   as   Vice   Principal   with   Directorate   of

   aforesaid property and it is contended that the petitioner is residing in his 

   own   flat   bearing   No.   A­401,   C­Dot   Group   Housing   Society,   Sector­56 

   (Gurgaon) and the petitioner's vehicle bearing No. HR 26AV 8083 is also 

   registered at the said address, but except taking a bald plea, the respondent 

   has not placed on record any material to show that the petitioner has been 

   residing   at   the   aforesaid   address   at   Gurgaon.   So   far   registration   of   the 

   petitioner's vehicle bearing No. HR 26AV 8083 at the aforesaid address of 

   the Gurgaon is concerned, the same does not make any difference   as the 

   petitioner   has   categorically   stated   in   the   counter   affidavit   that   he   had 

   purchased   the   car   from   a   dealer   in   Gurgaon   and,   therefore,   the   car   has 

   Haryana registration number. Though, the petitioner has not disputed that he 

   owns the aforesaid residential flat at Gurgaon, Haryana, but it is stated that 

   the residential flat at Gurgaon has been rented out. Nothing has been placed 

   on   record   by   the   respondent   that  the   petitioner  has  been  residing  in  the

   record the copy of his passport as well as Identity Card of his wife to show 

   that he has been residing in the aforesaid property at Greater Kailash, New

   the petitioner on the ground of bonafide requirement of the tenanted shop 

   for   commercial   purposes   for   Management   Consultancy   and   not   for 

   residential   purposes.   Similarly,   the   availability   of   another   residential 

   property bearing plot No. 1, Block B, Sector­19, Noida. is of no avail.

   New Delhi is situated in one of the well known markets in South Delhi and 

   commercial activity is being carried out not only from the shops on the 

   ground floor but also from the first and second floor and in fact in the entire 

   market, the ground floor is being used specially the shops in front like the 

   tenanted   shop   are   being   used   only   for   running   retail

    malafide. 
</p>
<p id="p_48">44.              However,   in   my   considered   opinion   there   is   no   merit   in   this 

   contention.   It   has   come  on   record that  the  first   and  second  floor of  the 

   aforesaid   property   is   being   used   by   the   petitioner   and   his   family   for 

   residential purposes and even if the upper floors of the property in Greater 

   Kailash Market are being used for commercial purposes, it does not mean 

   that   petitioner   should   shift   his   residence   elsewhere   just   for   the   sake   of 

   accommodating   the   tenant   in   the   suit   premises.     It   is   a   settled   law   that 

   landlord has a choice to shift any of the properties owned by him. The tenant 

   cannot force him to occupy any particular property. It has been held in Smt.  

   Satya Malhotra Vs. Mohinder Singh Arora, 81 (1999) DLT 627 that when 

   more than one premises are available to the landlord, it is for landlord to 

   select as to which is suitable to him. Neither the tenant nor the Court would 

   be   justified   in   imposing   on   the   landlord   to   shift   in   a   particular 

   accommodation so long as his selection is not unreasonable and malafide. 

   The petitioner has categorically stated in the petition that he is residing on 

   the   first   and   second   floor   of   the   property   bearing   No.   M­27,   Greater 

   Kailash­I, New Delhi and it will be convenient for the petitioner to set up his 

   multi­Disciplinary Management Consultancy services on the ground floor 

   of the same building.

   of the parties as respondent who has no tenancy rights in the suit premises.

   late Sh. Dhanpat Rai had left behind not only his widow and respondents no.

    the death of the tenant, tenancy devolves upon his LRs as joint tenancy and 

   then notice to one of the joint tenant is sufficient to terminate the tenancy

   tenanted premises  as tenanted shop also comprised of a store/box room at 

   the  rear  and   a  passage  leading to the same which the petitioner has not

   market of Greater Kailash No. 1 New Delhi was let out by Sh. Dev Prakash 

   Abrol to late Sh. Dhanpat Rai, predecessor­in­interest of the respondents no. 

   1 to  5. It  has  not been  mentioned in the lease deed 24.03.1970 that  any 

   store/box room at the rear side along with the passage was let out to the 

   predecessor­in­interest of the respondents no. 1 to 5 namely Sh. Dhanpat Rai 

   by   the   father   of   the   petitioner.   Therefore,   it   cannot   be   said   that   present 

   petition has been filed for part of the tenanted premises and the petitioner 

   has   not   shown   the   complete   tenanted   premises   in   the   site   plan.   The

   portion in the site plan as mentioned in the lease deed dated 24.03.1970 

   which is not in dispute. Hence, there is not merit in the contention of the 

   respondent   no.   1   that   the   present   petition  has   been   filed  for  part   of   the

   contended   that   the   main   intention   of   the   petitioner   in   filing   the   present 

   petition  is to evict the respondent from the tenanted shop and sell or let out 

   the tenanted shop on higher rent and the petitioner has also been negotiating 

   and approaching to various property dealers for the sale of tenanted shop. 

   The petitioner has denied the aforesaid contentions of the respondent no. 1

   p.m. or that the petitioner has approached to the various property dealer for 

   sale of the tenanted shop. Moreover, Section 19 of the DRC Act takes care 

   of this apprehension of the respondent that the petitioner wants to sell out 

   the suit property or let out the same on higher rent as by virtue of Section 19 

   of DRC Act, the landlord cannot re­let or sell the premises at higher prices 

   before expiry of 3 years from getting eviction order and in case the landlord

   Govt.   of   India   and   after   retirement   from   the   said   Govt.   services   on 

   30.04.2011,   he   is   intending   to   set   up   a   multi­service/disciplinary, 

   management consultancy firm to provide services to corporate clients.     It 

   is further case of the petitioner that he is residing on the first and second 

   floor of the building where the suit premises is situated on the ground floor 

   and   it   will   be   convenient   for   him   to   set   up   him   multi­disciplinary 

   Management Consultancy services on the ground floor of the same building 

   where he is residing.  The respondent has not been able to establish that the 

   petitioner   is   having   any   other   suitable   alternative   commercial 

   accommodation   except   the   suit   premises   to   start   his   Management 

   Consultancy   business.     Therefore,   the   need   of   the   petitioner   of   the   suit 

   premises   to   start   his   Management   Consultancy   cannot   be   said   to   be 

   malafide.   It has also been held in  Tarsem Singh Vs. Gurvinder Singh 173  

   (2010) DLT 379  that, "If the landlord wants to start his own business in  

   premises owned by him, by no stretch of imagination it can be said that  

   requirement of landlord for premises is neither genuine nor bona fide."
