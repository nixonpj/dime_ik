                                It comes out that during the initial proceedings that the

            Insurance Company tendered the insurance policy, which was

            marked as RW1 showing that it was operative from 07.02.1993 to

            06.02.1994. The accident took place on 17.11.1992. As such, it was

            held that the Insurance Company is not liable to pay the

            compensation. It was further held that since Baljit Singh, Employer

            had misrepresented the case, therefore, 50% of the compensation

            along with interest was imposed as penalty.

</p><p id="p_6">                                After passing of the said order, the application for review

            was filed by Baljit Singh (respondent No.3 herein) on the ground that

            the Insurance Company had tendered the wrong policy. In pursuant

            to the notice issued by the Court, the Insurance Company tendered

            the correct policy, which was operative on the date of accident. It was

            held that the policy covers the accident dated 17.11.1992.

            Consequently, the penalty of 50% along with interest was ordered to

            be paid by the Insurance Company.

</p><p id="p_8">                                Learned counsel for the Insurance Company has argued

            that the penalty was wrongly imposed upon the Insurance Company.

            For this purpose, reliance has been placed upon the authority of

            Hon'ble the Apex Court in case of "<a href="/doc/729146/" id="a_4">Ved Prakash Garg vs Premi

            Devi and others</a>", 1998 ACJ 1, wherein Hon'ble the Apex Court

                                "19. As a result of the aforesaid discussion it must be
                                held that the question posed for our consideration must
                                be answered partly in the affirmative and partly in the
                                negative. In other words the insurance company will be
                                liable to meet the claim for compensation along with
                                interest as imposed on the insured employer by the
                                Workmen's Commissioner under the <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_5">Compensation Act</a>
                                on the conjoint operation of <a href="/doc/1153878/" id="a_6">section 3</a> and <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_7">section 4-A</a>
                                sub-section (3)(a) of the <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_8">Compensation Act</a>. So far as
                                additional amount of compensation by way of penalty
                                imposed on the insured employer by the Workmen's
                                Commissioner under <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_9">Section 4-A</a> (3) (b) is concerned,
                                however, the insurance company would not remain liable
                                to reimburse the said claim and it would be the liability of
                                the insured employer alone."
</p>
<p id="p_10">                                A perusal of the facts of the said case would show that in

            the normal circumstance, the Insurance Company is liable to pay

            compensation along with interest but not the penalty part, which is to

            be paid by the employer. However, the facts of the present case are

            entirely different. In the present case, the Insurance Company

            contested the case and produced a wrong policy before the

            Commissioner to show that the insurance policy was not operative on

            the date of accident. However, when the review application was filed

            and correct insurance policy was produced showing that the policy

            was operative on the date of accident. In this way, there was a willful

            default on the part of the Insurance Company. Therefore, in these

            exceptional circumstances, the Commissioner was justified in

            ordering that the penalty of 50% along with interest shall be paid by
