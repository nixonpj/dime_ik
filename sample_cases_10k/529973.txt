<p id="p_1">      This appeal is preferred against the award of the Motor

Accidents Claims Tribunal, Thodupuzha in O.P.(MV)576/05.

The claimant sustained injuries in a road accident.       The

claimant was a passenger in a bus. The bus was coming

down and the lorry was going up and the claimant who was

sitting on the backside of the bus got injuries on his hand, in

all probability on account of putting the hand on the window-

sill.  The police after investigation filed a charge sheet

against the driver of the lorry. The Tribunal accepted the

same and found the driver of the lorry negligent for the

accident and awarded the compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.   Learned counsel for the appellant very strongly

contends before me that a reading of the scene mahazar

would reveal that the negligence is on the part of the bus

driver. The place of occurrence as per the scene mahazar is

50 c.m. west of the eastern tarred end in a road having 4.20

M.A.C.A. 663 OF 2009
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  -:2:-</span>

mtr. width. It is true that there is road margin on both the

sides. Suppose the contention of the learned counsel for the

appellant is to be accepted, I find that really there is no

width for a lorry to pass if the scene of occurrence is correct.

It is to be remembered that when an accident is about to

take place and the drivers understand such a situation then

normally they desperately attempt to avert the accident by

swerving the vehicle this side or that side and in very many

cases the scene of occurrence reported by the police officers

may not be correct. Here I need not elaborate for the reason

that the accident had taken place only 50 mtrs. west of

eastern tar end indicating the factor that there was no tarred

road at all for the lorry to pass. So it is clearly incorrect.

</p><p id="p_3">      3.    Now the question is whether a person putting a

hand on the window-sill can he be held to be contributory

negligent in a motor accident case.          This has been the

subject matter of the decision in very many cases and the

High Court of Andra Pradesh in the decision reported in

1992 (2) TAC 724 (AP) i.e <a href="/doc/1876788/" id="a_1">A.P.S.R.T.C v. Ramisetty

M.A.C.A</a>. 663 OF 2009
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              -:3:-</span>

Koteswara Rao and others held that there is a duty for

drivers to take reasonable precaution by leaving sufficient

space while overtaking or crossing any vehicle to ensure

safety to passengers. Therefore if the driver of the lorry had

kept a reasonable distance between two vehicles then even if

the hand was on window-sill the accident would not have

taken place.   Therefore in the light of the investigating

agency's conclusion that the lorry driver was negligent

coupled with the liability of the lorry driver to keep a

reasonable distance between the two vehicles to avoid such

contingencies I am not inclined to interfere with the decision

rendered by the Tribunal. Therefore the appeal lacks merit

and the same is dismissed.
