Heard on: 02.07.2019


Judgement on: 01.08.2019



Subhasis Dasgupta, J.:

      The affidavit-of-service furnished by the petitioner be kept on record.

      None appears for the opposite party no.2.
       This is an application under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_2">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal

Procedure praying for quashing of a proceeding being G.R. Case No.1139 of

2018 arising out of Singur Police Station Case No.319 of 2018 dated

04.09.2018</pre><p id="p_1"> under <a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_3">Sections 447</a>/<a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_4">323</a>/<a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_5">324</a>/<a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_6">354</a>/<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">354B</a>/<a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_8">379</a>/<a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_9">506</a>/<a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_10">509</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_11">34</a> of the

Indian Penal Code, now pending before the Learned Additional Chief Judicial

Magistrate, Chandernagore, Hooghly.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      The petitioner no.1 for the medical crisis of his wife admittedly sold 40

decimals of land from his ancestral share to his niece, petitioner no.2 receiving

valuable consideration. The husband of opposite party no.2 is the full brother

of petitioner no.1. It is the case of the petitioner that the husband of opposite

party no.2 in collusion with opposite party no.2 and their henchmen tried to

grab the property of the petitioner no.1, what has already been sold to

petitioner no.2. To take forceful possession of the transferred property, there

developed ill feeling and animosity between the parties, which could be found

from previously instituted proceeding under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_12">Sections 107</a> and <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_13">144</a> Cr.P.C. by

the petitioner no.2 against the opposite party no.2 and her family members.



</p><p id="p_3">      However, the contention levelled against the opposite party no.2 and her

family members is that on 17th August, 2018 at about 7:30 A.M. in the

morning the opposite party no.2 and her associates tried to take forceful

possession of the purchased land of petitioner no.2 (sold by petitioner no.1 to

petitioner no.2), which having resisted, the opposite party no.2, her husband

and henchman assaulted the petitioner nos.2 and 3, extorted money from
 them and molested petitioner no.2. As police did not do anything favourable

for the petitioners on the basis of information lodged at their instance, a court

complaint under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_14">Section 156(3)</a> Cr.P.C. was filed. After being ordered by the

court, police took up investigation in connection with Singur Police Station

Case      No.350      of    2018     dated     19.9.2018     under      <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_15">Sections

341</a>/<a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_16">447</a>/<a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_17">323</a>/<a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_18">324</a>/<a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_19">354</a>/<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_20">354B</a>/<a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_21">379</a>/<a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_22">504</a>/<a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_23">506</a>/<a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_24">509</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_25">34</a> of the Indian Penal

Code.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        The contention raised against the petitioners is that on 17.8.2018 at

about 8 A.M. over long pending property matters they abused o.p. no.2 and

her family members with use of filthy languages and wounded them with the

use of lathi, katari etc and outrage the modesty of woman (o.p. no.2) after

snatching away golden chain from the possession of the complainant. Police

after investigation submitted charge-sheet making out a prima facie case

under <a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_26">Sections 447</a>/<a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_27">323</a>/<a href="/doc/1133601/" id="a_28">325</a>/<a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_29">354</a>/<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_30">354B</a>/<a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_31">379</a>/<a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_32">506</a>/<a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_33">509</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_34">34</a> of the Indian

Penal Code against petitioners, proposed for quashment in this case.

</p><p id="p_5">        Adverting to such facts involved in two separate cases, learned advocate

for the petitioners submitted that the allegations contained in the complaint

pertaining to Singur P.S. Case No.319/18 dated 4.9.2018 was completely

absurd and inherently improbable, as no prudent man could ever reach to a

just conclusion that there was sufficient grounds for proceeding against the

petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        Learned advocate for the petitioners further submitted that the instant

case was nothing but to take a retaliation measure against the property sold
 by petitioner no.1 to petitioner no.2 contrary to the interest of family members

of opposite party no.2, this false case was instituted against the petitioners,

and if such proceedings were allowed to be continued anymore, there would be

an abuse of the process of the court.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      Learned advocate representing the State collecting copy of the C.D.

submitted that when investigation already ended in charge-sheet making out a

prima facie case against the petitioners the instant case should not have been

allowed to be quashed merely smelling existence of a counter version.



</p><p id="p_8">      The only point to be addressed by this Court is whether the pending

proceeding, if allowed to be continued, there would be an abuse of process of

the court, as alleged, or not.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      Admittedly, the petitioner no.1 and the husband of the opposite party

no.2 are brothers by full blood. The property sold by petitioner no.1 to

petitioner no.2 is the ancestral share and in the ancestral property, the

husband of the opposite party no.2 has also property to the extent of his

ancestral share. The petitioner no.2 having felt disturbed with the possession

at the instance of the opposite party family members and others even after

purchase of the property from petitioner no.1 to the extent his share already

filed a suit in connection with Title Suit No.231 of 2018 now pending before

the Learned Civil Judge (Junior Division), Chandernagore, Hooghly. Civil suit

having already instituted, the same is expected to resolve the property dispute

pending between the parties, if there be any at all.
</p><p id="p_10">        The copy of the C.D. contained sufficient materials supportive of a

prosecution under <a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_35">Sections 447</a>/<a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_36">323</a>/<a href="/doc/1133601/" id="a_37">325</a>/<a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_38">354</a>/<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_39">354B</a>/<a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_40">379</a>/<a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_41">506</a>/<a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_42">509</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_43">34</a> of the

Indian Penal Code. The statement of the complaint was separately recorded

transpiring prima facie materials against the accused persons contrary to the

stand, as specifically taken by the petitioners in this case. From the certified

copy of the order of the lower court record produced in course of hearing, it

appears that the learned court below has already fixed date for supply of copy

meaning thereby the learned court below is about to commence the trial in this

case after framing of the charge. That being the position, it would not be wise

enough to quash the instant proceedings ignoring the materials already

collected against the petitioners during the course of investigation making out

a prima facie case upon merely visualizing a counter version, registered in

connection with Singur Police Station Case No.350 of 2018 dated 19.9.2018

under <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_44">Sections 341</a> /<a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_45">447</a> / <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_46">323</a>/ <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_47">324</a>/ <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_48">354</a>/ <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_49">354B</a>/ <a href="/doc/1101188/" id="a_50">379</a>/ <a href="/doc/555306/" id="a_51">504</a>/ <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_52">506</a>/ <a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_53">509</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_54">34</a> of

the Indian Penal Code.
</p>
<p id="p_11">       The plenary jurisdiction vested to Court under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_55">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. is

exercisable when the complaint prima facie leaves materials to show that it is

vexatious, out and out falls and mala fide one. The materials as revealed in

course of investigation cannot be taken to have passed the tests, mentioned in

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_56">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. itself, i.e., to give effect to any order under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_57"> the Code</a>, or to

prevent abuse of the process of the court, or otherwise to secure ends of

justice as proposed by petitioner. The quashing is thus without the sanction of

law.
</p><p id="p_12">       Whether the instant prosecution against the petitioners is attributable to

the act complained of for taking vengeance against the petitioners by the

opposite party no.2 family members, out of their previous animosity arising

out of property dispute, the same cannot be decided at this stage without

entering into trial of both the cases, when there will be collection of evidence in

both the cases, if any charge-sheet is at all submitted in connection with

Singur Police Station Case No.350 of 2018 dated 19.9.2018.



</p><p id="p_13">      That being the position, the Court is of the view that petitioners are not

remediless at this moment and enough opportunities are left open to agitate

the issue, favourable to the purpose of the petitioners after capitalizing the

materials already collected against the petitioners. The quashing as proposed

thus refused being without any merits.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">      The revisional application fails.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      Petitioners are, however, given liberty to raise points favourable to their

purpose at the time of consideration of charge and if any such point is raised,

that shall be duly addressed to by the learned court below giving sufficient

opportunities to either of the parties to this case without being untrammeled

by the observation made in the body of this order.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      With this observation/direction, the revisional application stands

disposed of.
</p><p id="p_18">       Urgent certified photostat copy of this judgement, if applied for, be given

to the parties as expeditiously as possible on compliance of all necessary

formalities.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
