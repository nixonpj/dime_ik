    along with interest @24%p.a.  The defendant has issued various receipts

   acknowledging the said amount, however, he has not repaid the amount

   despite various demands and kept on prolonging the same on one pretext

   of the other.  Thus , the plaintiff left with no alternative but to got served a

   legal notice dated 04.08.2007 upon him  demanding the amount.  After the

   receipt of the said legal notice the defendant contacted the plaintiff and

   requested him to repay the said amount within a period of 6­months and

   executed a receipt dt 25.10.2007. But, despite the expiry of the said 6­

   months   period   the   defendant   has   not   paid   any   amount.   Therefore,   the

   plaintiff left with no alternative but to file the present suit. 

     18        On the other hand, the defendant has taken a plea that he has not

               taken any loan from the plaintiff and never demanded any money

               and the entire case filed by the plaintiff is false and fictitious.  He

               has also taken a plea that none of the receipt relied by the plaintiff

               have   executed   by   the   defendant   at   any   point   of   time.     He   has

               further   taken   a   plea   that   litigation   has   commenced   between   the

               plaintiff and the defendant since the year 2005, therefore there was

               no question  of issuing receipt dated 25.10.2007 in favour of the

               Ex.PW1/1 to PW1/20. A perusal of receipt Ex.Pw1/2 shows that

               same was executed on 5.10.2003 which goes against the case of the

               plaintiff   that   the   amount   was   given   to   the   defendant   from   the

               period of 2001­02. The defendant has denied his signatures on all

               and the date t of amount paid, he has further stated that defendant

<p id="p_35">                 The defendant has denied the execution of any such receipt or any

          plaintiff is Rs.4,15,000/­.   In the plaint, it mentioned that same was

          advanced  from  the  period of  2001­02.   However, during  his  cross­

          examination   the   plaintiff   has   stated   that   the   amount   was   advanced

     21        In view of the above I am of the considered view that  the plaintiff

      24         Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff contended that the defendant executed

               the receipt Ex.PW1/23 on 25.10.2007  therefore, a fresh period of

               limitation  has commenced from that date and suit has been filed

               within  three years from 25.10.2007. which is within a period of

               limitation.   The   defendant   has   however   denied   the   execution   of

               receipt   Ex   PW1/23   and   the   plaintiff   has   also   could   not   bring

               sufficient material on record on the basis of which it can be said

               that same was executed by the defendant. It is also relevant that

               there   are   material   contradiction   in   the   testimony   of   pws   which

               makes the existence of ExPw1/23 highly improbable . Even if it is

               assumed   that   Ex   PW1/17   was   executed   by   the   defendant   ,   still

               present suit is barred by limitation



     25          It   is   well   settled   law   that   the   period   of   limitation   once   start

               commencing does not stop.   In the instance case, it started in the

               year 2003 when the last payment was made as per the plaintiff and

               it continued up till 2006.   As per the plaintiff, the defendant had

               acknowledged the liability vide Ex.PW1/23 on 25.10.2007 i.e. after

               the expiry of period of limitation. The effect of acknowledgment

               has   been   mentioned   in   <a href="/doc/85586/" id="a_4">Section   18</a>   of   the   Limitation   Act   1962

<p id="p_42">

   A perusal of clause 1 <a href="/doc/85586/" id="a_5">Section 18</a> clearly shows that acknowledgment of

   liability in respect of any property or right is required to be made before

   the expiry of the period of limitation only then a fresh period of limitation

   would start from the date of such acknowledgement.  In the instance case,

   the   limitation   for   filing   the   suit   commenced   in   the   year   2003   and   it

   expired   in   the   year   2006.   The   receipt   Ex.PW1/17   as   per   the   plaintiff

   the relative of the plaintiff approached her and requested for money as he

   was   in   dire   need   of   money.     Considering   the   relationship   with   the

   defendant, the plaintiff paid total sum of Rs.4,55,000/­ to the defendant on

   different dates, commencing from the year 2000­03. The said amount was

   to be written along with an interest @24%p.a.  The defendant had issued

   various receipts acknowledging the said amount to him.  However, he had

   not written the amount despite various demands and kept on prolonging

   the same on one pretext of the other.  Therefore, the plaintiff left with no

   alternative   but   to   got   issued   a  legal   notice  dated   04.08.2007   upon   the

   defendant   demanding   the   amount.     After   the   receipt   of   the   said   legal

   was   advanced   to   the   defendant   from   the   year   2000­03   vide   receipt

   Ex.PW1/1  to  PW1/14.    The defendant  has  denied  his  signatures  on all

   no amount was ever advanced to the defendant by them.   She has also

   denied   that   defendant   have   not   executed   the   receipt   dated   25.10.2007.

   Plaintiff has also examined her brother Harbans Lal as PW­2, during his

   cross­examination he stated that the receipt was written by his brother­in­

   law on 25.10.2007 in his own handwriting.  Two receipts were prepared

   on that day. One receipt was for Rs.4,15,000/­ and another one was for

   Rs.4,55,000/­.  The defendant had put his signatures on the receipt on the

   revenue stamp.  He had also put his signatures on that receipt.  He denied

   that   no   receipt   was   executed   on   25.10.2007   by   the   defendant   at   the

   residence   of   his   sister.     The   plaintiff   has   also   examined   his   daughter

   Neetu. As PW­3, during her cross­examination, she stated that total loan

   amount is Rs.4,55,000/­ the receipt dated 25.10.2007 was prepared in her

   house.  Admitted that Harbans Lal is her Meternal Uncle. The receipt was

   prepared by her father in his handwriting in the present of the defendant.

   None except her father, mother and meternal uncle and the defendant was

   present when the receipt was executed.  The defendant signed the receipt

   and thereafter witnesses put their signatures.   She denied that no receipt

   was executed on 25.10.2007.  The defendant has denied the execution of

    any such receipt or any loan having taken by him from the plaintiff. The

   examination of the evidence of the plaintiff shows that total loan amount

   as per the plaintiff is Rs.4,55,000/­.  In the plaint, it mentioned that same

   was advanced from the period of 2000­03.   However, during her cross­

   examination the plaintiff has stated that the amount was advanced from

   the period of 2001­04.  The said deposition of the plaintiff is beyond her

   pleading.  The plaintiff has further taken a plea on after issuance of legal

   notice dated 25.10.2007.   The defendant approached her and executed a

   receipt Ex.PW1/17.   PW­2, Sh. Harbans Lal has categorically stated that

   two   receipts   were   executed   by   her   brother­in­law   for   an   amount   of

   Rs.4,15,000/­ and Rs.4,55,000/­ on which eh put his signatures.  However,

   PW­1 has clarified that although the amount of loan was Rs.4,55,000/­,

   however,   inadvertently,   the   amount   of   Rs.4,40,000/­   mentioned   in   the

   receipt   Ex.PW1/17.     A   perusal   of   Ex.PW1/17   clearly   shows   that   it   is

   mentioned in the said receipt that a sum of Rs.4,40,000 was taken by the

   defendant on various dated form the plaintiff and he assured to pay the

   said amount within 6­months. As per the plaintiff the receipt Ex.PW1/17

   was prepared in the handwriting of her husband Sh. Mahender Lal.  PW­1

   has explained that the amount of Rs.4,40,000/­ is inadvertently mentioned

   instead of Rs.4,55,000/­.   The plaintiff has not examined Sh. Mahender

   Lal   who   has   written   Ex.   PW1/17   to   clear   the   said   inconsistency   of

    typographical error in the receipt.  The defendant in the written statement

   categorically denied that he had not taken any loan from the plaintiff nor

   executed any receipt in favour of the plaintiff at any point of time.  He has

   also denied that receipt Ex.PW1/1 to PW1/14 as well as PW1/17 does not

   bear his signatures.   The plaintiff has not led any evidence to prove the

   receipt Ex.PW1/1 to PW1/14 and PW1/17 was executed by the defendant.

   She   also   not   led   any   evidence   to   show   that   these   receipts   bears   the

   signatures of defendant. The plaintiff has not examined any independent

   witness  in  whose presence the amount  was paid  by the plaintiff  to the

   defendant   at   any   point   of   time.   Thus,   the   plaintiff   has   not   produced

   sufficient material in record on the basis of which it can be assumed that

   she advanced the loan to the defendant on various dates by Ex.PW1/1 to

   PW1/13.     She   further   place   on   record   that   receipt   Ex.PW1/17   was
