                                 JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The plaintiff Bank filed this suit against the defendant for recovery of

an amount of Rs.6,80,202/- from the defendant with future interest,

contending that, the defendant had approached the plaintiff bank for

financial assistance of Rs.5,70,000/- under Auto Loan scheme for

purchasing 'Scorpio' Vehicle bearing Registration No.KA-03-MF-6755.

After considering the requirement of the defendant, the plaintiff        bank

agreed to provide financial assistance of Rs.5,70,000/- to the defendant with

a condition that, the defendant should repay the said sum at Equated

Monthly Instalments of Rs.12,255/- per month for a period of 59 months and

the plaintiff bank have sanctioned loan of Rs.5,70,000/- to the defendant on

11.7.2006. The defendant has executed Credit Facility Application Form

dated: 7.7.2006 in favour of the plaintiff bank agreeing to repay the loan

amount    with interest at the rate of 10.90% per annum and executed

Unattested Deed of Hypothecation agreement along with Irrevocable Power

of Attorney in the nature of Hire Purchase dated: 7.7.2006 and hypothecated

the said vehicle in favour of the plaintiff bank.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. The defendant after availing the sum of Rs.5,70,000/- undertook to

repay the loan amount in equated monthly instalments, as stated above and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      3            OS No.25411/2012</span>



agreed that, in the event of default, the plaintiff bank would be entitled to

recall the entire loan amount and to take further steps for recovery and

enforcement of security in accordance with the terms of the agreement. But,

the defendant became defaulter. Despite several requests and reminders, the

defendant failed to repay the loan amount, as agreed by him.      Hence, the

plaintiff bank got issued legal notice to the defendant on 17.1.2011 by

RPAD calling upon the defendant to repay the said loan amount. Inspite of

it, the defendant failed to pay the loan amount. Therefore, as on the date of

this suit, the defendant was due to the plaintiff bank a total       sum of

Rs.6,80,202.00, as detailed below:</p><pre id="pre_2">

Principal outstanding amount:                      Rs.3,74,837.99
Late Payment penalty:                              Rs. 2,34,526.00
Cheque Bouncing Charges &amp; other Charges:           Rs. 4,496.00
Interest for the month:                            Rs.       00.00
Prepayment charges @ 0% at the O/S principal:      Rs.       00.00
Interest in Pending Installment:                    Rs. 66,342.01
                                 Total:              Rs.6,80,202.00

Hence, this suit.

</pre><p id="p_3">      3. After registration of this suit, suit summons were issued to the

defendant. Inspite of service of summons on the defendant, he did not turn

up. Hence, the defendant was placed exparte and this case was posted for

evidence of the plaintiff bank.

</p><p id="p_5">      4. The plaintiff bank in order to prove its case, got filed the

Affidavit of its Officer by way of examination-in-chief. Same was taken as

<p id="p_6">      5. Heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_7">      6. The Points that would arise for the consideration of this court are

as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      (1) Whether the plaintiff bank proves that, on 11.7.2006, the
      defendant had availed loan of Rs.5,70,000/- from it agreeing
      to repay the same with interest at the rate of 10.90% per
      annum?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      (2) Whether the plaintiff bank proves that, it is entitled to
      recover the suit claim of Rs.6,80,202/- from the defendant
      with future interest?

      Ex.P6-Irrevocable power of attorney

      Ex.P9-Loan recall notice.</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">



</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">      9. In this case, the defendant was placed exparte. Thus, it is crystal

clear that, the defendant has not at all placed any contrary materials on

record to discard or disbelieve the case of the plaintiff bank.    If at all the

case of the plaintiff bank is not correct, the defendant would have definitely

appeared before the court in order to contest the case of the plaintiff, but, he

has not done so and he remained absent before the court. The absence of the

defendant before the court itself clearly goes to show that, he has admitted

the claim of the plaintiff bank.</blockquote><p id="p_8">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      6              OS No.25411/2012</span>



</p><p id="p_9">            10. On perusal of the documentary evidence produced by the

plaintiff bank at Ex.P2 the Credit Facility Application Form, it is crystal

clear that, the defendant by filing Ex.P2 has sought for sanction of loan of

Rs.5,70,000/- from the plaintiff bank in his favour. Ex.P3-Proforma Invoice

discloses that, the defendant has produced Proforma Invoice showing the

total value of the Scorpio Vehicle at Rs.9,74,262/-. To purchase the said

Vehicle, the defendant had applied for sanctioning of loan from the

plaintiff bank.   Ex.P4 the Credit Facility Application Form which also

indicates that, the defendant by filing Ex.P4 sought for sanctioning of loan

of Rs.5,70,000/- from the plaintiff Bank. Ex.P5 the Unattested Deed of

Hypothecation, which clearly demonstrates that, the defendant had

hypothecated      the   Scropio   Vehicle    with     the   plaintiff    bank.

Ex.P6 the Irrevocable Power of Attorney executed by the defendant in

favour of the plaintiff bank. Ex.P7 the Prepayment of Car Loan Account

and Ex.P8 the Statement of Accounts of the plaintiff bank, which clearly

reflects that, the plaintiff bank had advanced loan of Rs.5,70,000/- to

the defendant on 11.7.2006 and outstanding balance payable              by the

defendant in favour of the plaintiff bank as on the date of the suit was at

Rs.6,80,202/-. Ex.P9 the Loan Recall Notice issued by the plaintiff Bank to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                       7            OS No.25411/2012</span>



the defendant calling upon the defendant to repay the loan amount. So,

from the affidavit evidence of PW1 and documentary evidence at Exs.P2 to

P9, it is crystal clear that, the defendant had approached the plaintiff bank

and availed loan of Rs.5,70,000/- from the plaintiff bank on 11.7.2006.

Thus, the plaintiff bank has proved that, on 11.7.2006, the defendant had

availed loan of Rs.5,70,000/- from it agreeing to repay the said sum with

interest at the rate of 10.90% per annum and has executed necessary loan

documents, as narrated above, in favour of the plaintiff bank. But, the

defendant, as agreed by him failed to repay the loan amount to the plaintiff

bank, despite issuance of legal notice to the defendant by the plaintiff bank

and reminders to the defendant. Therefore, as on the date of this suit, the

defendant was due to pay a sum of Rs.6,80,202/- to the plaintiff bank.

Hence, the plaintiff bank is entitled to recover the           suit claim of

Rs.6,80,202/- from the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      11. The plaintiff bank has sought for future interest at the rate of

18% per annum. By taking into consideration that the huge suit claim

amount, I am of the considered view that, if future interest at the rate of

18% per annum is awarded, it will over-burden the defendant. Therefore, I

am of the considered view that, the plaintiff is entitled to future interest at

the rate of 12% per annum. Therefore, I answer Point Nos. 1 and 2 in the

affirmative.
</p>
<p id="p_11">       12. POINT NO.3:- In view of the aforesaid reasons on Point Nos.1

and 2, I proceed to pass the following:
