        CORAM: HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE RAJESH H.SHUKLA

                           Date : 21/04/2015


                             ORAL ORDER</pre>


<p id="p_1">   1. The present Petition is filed by the Petitioner under Articles 14,

      19, 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India as well as under the

      provisions of the Land Revenue Code, 1879 for the prayer inter

      alia that appropriate writ, order or direction may be issued

      quashing and setting aside the order passed in Stay Application

      MVV/Land/Sabarkatha/7/2014 by the Special Secretary, Revenue

      Department (Dispute), Gujarat State dated 2.12.2014, on the

      grounds stated in the memo of petition.
</p>
<p id="p_2">   2. Heard learned Advocate Shri Tarak Damani for the Petitioner.

      Learned Advocate Shri Damani has referred to the papers and the

      impugned order at Annexure-A and tried to submit that the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                Page 1 of 3</span>
       C/SCA/5464/2015                                   ORDER



  Petitioner who has purchased the land in question by a sale deed

  has not been heard. He further submitted that at least the Petitioner

  who has been pursuing the remedy ought to have been issued

  notice and the Petitioner would step in the shoes of the original

  owner and therefore he has challenged the impugned order on the

  grounds stated in the memo of Petition inter alia that opportunity of

  hearing has not been given to the Petitioner, who claims to have

  acquired the title by sale deed in her favour.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3. Though such submissions have been made, the background of the

  facts as it is reflected from the papers, it is evident that the land

  was given in bhudan to the original land owner i.e. Kalabhai

  Khemabhai and he seems to have dealt with the land in

  contravention and breach of the conditions. The land which has

  been granted in bhudan could not have been transferred to anyone

  without permission and at least not for any other purpose like

  commercial. The fact that the agricultural land which has been

  given at the time of bhudan was with a view to achieve some

  object of such bhudan movement. However, subsequently, when

  such a agricultural land is sought to be transferred without any

  permission it will not be valid. The person who claims the right,

  title, interest pursuant to any sale deed would also be required to be

  considered. The background has also been discussed in the papers


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             Page 2 of 3</span>
             C/SCA/5464/2015                                   ORDER



        which inter alia referred to the fact that the original owner had also

        litigated having filed Special Civil Application No. 4979 of 1982

        and Special Civil Application No. 4971 of 1982 which came to be

        disposed of by order dated 30.12.1982 confirming the order of the

        Collector. Thereafter, Letters Patent Appeal No. 37 of 1983 was

        also filed which was also disposed of. It transpires that the right of

        the original owner to transfer the land, the observations have been

        made that he does not have any such right to transfer the land and

        therefore the person like Petitioner who is claiming right pursuant

        to one of the successive transaction, cannot have any say in the

        matter. The present Petition therefore deserves to be dismissed in

        limine and accordingly stands dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4. At the request made by learned Advocate Shri Tarak Damani for

        the Petitioner, it is clarified that any proceedings pending before

        the authority may be considered on its own merits.
