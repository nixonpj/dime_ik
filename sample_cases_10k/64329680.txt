                               The learned trial Court on appreciation of evidence adduced by

           the parties and rival submissions made by their respective counsels came to

           hold that agreement to sell dated 19.05.2003 was executed by the defendant

           for sale of the suit land but rejected plea of the plaintiff-appellant that he

           always remained ready and willing to perform his part of the contract and as

           a result, suit of the plaintiff was decreed for alternative relief of recovery of

           Rs.13,600/- paid towards earnest money along with interest @ 12% per

           annum from 09.05.2003 till its realisation with proportionate costs.

           the plaintiff-appellant was held entitled to recovery of Rs.27,200/- on

           account of earnest money and damages along with interest @ 12% per

<p id="p_11">                               Counsel for the appellant contends that as the defendant denied

           execution of the agreement, it was not open for him to raise an issue that the

           plaintiff was not ready and willing to perform his part of the agreement. It is

           further argued that the plaintiff issued notice dated 12.06.2004 Ex.P2 calling

           upon the defendant to execute the sale deed but he failed to do so.

           Immediately thereafter, he filed the suit seeking specific performance of the

           agreement on 08.10.2004, therefore, the evidence on record is more than

           sufficient to substantiate his plea that he always remained ready and willing

           to perform his part of the agreement i.e. payment of balance amount towards

           on the part of the plaintiff" and it is a condition precedent for obtaining

           relief of specific performance. There cannot be any dispute about the settled

           position of law that it is enjoined upon the party who wants to enforce

           specific performance of contract to aver and prove that he has performed or

           has always been ready and willing to perform the essential terms of the

           contract. As per the case set up by the plaintiff, the parties agreed to execute

           the sale deed on 18.05.2004 and on that day, the plaintiff-appellant was

           obligated to pay the balance amount of Rs.21,400/- before the Sub

           Registrar. Counsel for the appellant has fairly conceded that on 18.05.2004,

           the plaintiff did not go to the office of the Sub Registrar along with the

           balance sale consideration. He has not tendered any justifiable explanation

           for his failure to go to the office of the Sub Registrar for performing his part

           of the agreement as per the terms and conditions of agreement for sale dated

           19.05.2003. Under these circumstances, I do not find any merit in the

           contentions of the appellant that Courts have committed any error much less

           perversity in declining his claim for specific performance of the agreement

           and thus the judicial discretion exercised by the Courts cannot be faulted
