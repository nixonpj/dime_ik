P.C.:

1                 This petition had been admitted by an order dated 10 th  July, 

</pre><p id="p_1">1998. The claim of petitioner was based upon an Inter Corporate Deposit 

dated 3rd  November, 1995 for Rs.50,00,000/-. The company had made part 

payment of Rs.27,92,800/-. It is the case of petitioner that an amount of 

Rs.25,00,000/- towards principal  alongwith interest at 36% was due  and 

payable by the company and during the pendency of the petition, a further 

amount of Rs.1,00,000/- has been paid by the company. An appeal was filed 

challenging the order of admission and that appeal came to be dismissed by 

an order dated 3rd August, 1998.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2                 The   company   filed   a   reference   to   Board   for   Industrial   and

the reference on file, the company took out a company application no.475 of

1998  seeking stay  of  publication  because   the  reference  was registered in 

BIFR.   By   an   order   dated   6th  August,   1998,   the   company   application   was 

allowed and consequently, publication was stayed. Therefore, the petition 

though admitted, has not been published.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3                 The BIFR sanctioned a Rehabilitation Scheme for 7 years from 

31st  March, 2013 to 31st  March, 2020 for implementation by all concerned 

under <a href="/doc/262489/" id="a_1">Section 18</a> of Sick Industrial companies Act (SICA). Once the Scheme 

is sanctioned, as provided in <a href="/doc/1307241/" id="a_2">Section 18(8)</a> of SICA, it shall be binding upon 

all   the   creditors.   Under   the   Scheme,   the   claim   of   petitioner   herein   was 

settled at Rs.5,42,000/- approximately 22.6% of its claim. This amount was 

arrived at par with other unsecured corporate lenders. As provided in clause 

7.3 (i) of the Scheme, copy whereof is annexed to an affidavit of one Kiran 

Jangla affirmed on 22nd March, 2018, this amount of Rs.5,42,000/- was to 

be paid within six months of sanction of Scheme. Six months would have 

expired   on   6th  March,2016   since   the   date   of   sanction   of   the   Scheme   is 

7th  September,   2015.   Admittedly,   this   amount   has   not   been   paid   and   in 

effect, there is a contravention by the company of this Scheme. Mr. Dubey, 

counsel for petitioner, therefore, is seeking winding up of the company.

4                 At the outset, Mr. Tamboly, counsel for the company raises a 

preliminary objection on the jurisdiction of this Court to hear the matter any 

further.   According   to   Mr.   Tamboly,   <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_3">Section   252</a>   of   the   Insolvency   and 

Bankruptcy   Code,  2016  (IBC)   amended   the   Sick   Industrial   Companies

(Special   Provisions)   Repeal   Act,   2003   (1   of   2004)   and   the   Central 

Government   in   exercise   of   the   powers   conferred   by   sub-section   (1)   of 

Section   242   of   the   IBC   has   made   an   order   to   remove   difficulties   dated 

24th  May,   2017   whereby   a   proviso   has   been   inserted   stating   that   "any  

Scheme sanctioned under sub-section (4) or any Scheme under implementation  

under sub-section (12) of <a href="/doc/262489/" id="a_4">Section 18</a> of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special  

Provisions) Act, 1985, shall be deemed to be an approved resolution plan under  

sub-section   (1)   of   Section   31   of   the   IBC   and   same   shall   be   dealt   with,   in  

accordance   with   the   provisions   of   Part   II   of   IBC".   Mr.   Tamboly,   therefore, 

submits   that   this   Court   should   transfer   the   matter   to   NCLT   for   further 

consideration as required under Section 33 of the IBC and in particular, sub-

section (3) of Section 33 of IBC.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
5                   Mr. Dubey submitted that since the petition was admitted much 

before the IBC was even contemplated and the petition was stayed because 

of the reference filed by the company to BIFR, this Court should continue to 

exercise its jurisdiction and pass the final winding up order.


6                   I   have   given   careful   thought   to   the   IBC   (removing   of 

difficulties)   Order   of   2017   dated   24th  May,   2017.   It   would   be   useful   to

sanctioned and under implementation under sub-section (12) of <a href="/doc/262489/" id="a_18">Section 18</a> 

of SICA. For removing the difficulties, the Central Government made the IBC

expressly provided that "any scheme sanctioned under sub-section (4) or any
