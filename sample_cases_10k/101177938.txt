    and the assessment of performance at the age of 60 or 62 years, as the

    case may be, for being retained till the age of 62 years or 65 years is




                                                   
    illegal, unreasonable, harsh, unrealistic and contrary to the UGC

    Regulations, 2010. When the prescribed qualifications for the post of

    Assistant Professor do not provide for a Ph.D. Degree as the necessary




                                        
    qualification, the State cannot be allowed to insist on such a qualification
                         
    for being continued up to the age of 62 years. Once the UGC Regulations
                        
    have extended the age of retirement to 65 years unconditionally, it is not

    permissible for the State Government to extend the age of retirement on
      


    such conditions of educational qualifications etc. Mr.Desai, the learned
   



    counsel appearing for some of the petitioners submitted that the UGC Act

    was enacted by the Parliament in exercise of its powers under Entry 66 of





    List 1 to Schedule VII of the Constitution and, therefore, it is a Central

    Legislation as contained in <a href="/doc/344383/" id="a_1">Article 254(1)</a> of the Constitution.                The





    formulation of service conditions of the university and college teachers,

    including the determination of the age of superannuation is the subject

    matter of State Legislation as the same would fall within Entry 25 of List

    III and there cannot be any conflict between the provisions of the UGC

    service conditions of such teachers.    In short the State Government is




                                                    
    bound by the UGC Regulations and if the said Regulations have not

    imposed any conditions for extending the age of superannuation beyond




                                                   
    60 years, it would not be within the competence of the State Government

    to impose any conditions or any conditions like the Ph.D. degree or

    performance assessment by a specially constituted committee.                   The




                                        
    enhancement in the age of retirement is required to be unconditional
                         
    subject to the incumbent being found medically fit. The Regulations
                        
    formulated by the UGC are a composite package and it is not permissible

    for the State Government to accept something unconditionally and
      


    impose conditions while granting some other benefits. If the UGC in its
   



    wisdom has decided to enhance the age of retirement unconditionally, the

    decision of the State to impose the impugned conditions is illegal and





    requires to be quashed and set aside. It was also urged that even the

    preamble of the impugned Resolution has considered the vacancy





    position and the scarcity of experienced and qualified college teachers. It

    has been stated that there are about 17000 vacancies of Assistant

    Professors, Associate Professors and Professors etc. and, therefore, there

    is a need to retain the experienced college and university teachers by

    enhancing the age of retirement. On the backdrop of these realities the




                                                                           
    State Government ought to have extended the age of retirement without




                                                   
    imposing any conditions so long as the concerned teachers were found to

    be medically fit. When the Ph.D. degree is not an essential qualification




                                                  
    for appointment to the post of Assistant Professor or for granting senior

    scale / selection grade, imposing of such a condition for enhancing the

    age of retirement up to 62 years is arbitrary and more so when the




                                       
    Professors concerned have reached at the fag end of their career and
                         
    insistence on the Ph.D. degree qualification would be, therefore, an
                        
    impossible condition. If such a condition is followed strictly coupled

    with the assessment of performance, the enhancement in the age of
      


    retirement would remain on paper and it would be only an illusion as
   



    there would be hardly any college teachers who would be eligible for

    being retained till the age of 62 years. The learned counsel also brought





    to our notice that similar challenge has been allowed by the High Court of

    Jharkhand in Writ Petition No.363 of 2010 and others, the High Court of





    Patna in CWJC No.11348 of 2010 and ors. and the High Court of

    letter dated 27th July 1998 addressed to the UGC and by the said letter

    while revising the pay scales in line with the Fifth Pay Commission
      


    Recommendations the age of superannuation of University and College
   



    teachers was fixed at 62 years and it was left open to the University or

    College to re-employ superannuated teacher according to the guidelines





    framed by the UGC up to the age of 65 years. Accordingly, the UGC

    Regulations of 2000 increased the age of superannuation to 62 years for





    college and university teachers. On 23rd March 2007 the Government of

    India addressed a letter to the UGC for enhancement of age of

    was clarified in the said communication that the enhancement of

    of 2000 the Government of India's directives have been taken into
      


    consideration and the age of retirement has been increased to 62 years for
   



    the college and university teachers.   It is pertinent to note that the UGC

    for that matter of the State Government on their respective claims in these

    benefit of enhancement in the age of retirement. Though there was no

    requirement for a candidate to be appointed to the post of Assistant

    termed to be unreasonable conditions. The State Government has not

    violated or acted in breach of the UGC Regulations 2010 or the

    Government of India's instructions dated 31st December 2008. The State




                                       
    Government is well within its rights, while enhancing the age of
                         
    retirement, to impose conditions of higher qualifications and assessment

    be unacceptable to the Government of India or the UGC, it is entirely a

    have been appointed at the initial stage, as per the Rules and other

     such a promotion could not be granted without
   



     consultation with the Public Service Commission, it
     asked respondents 2 to 11 to offer themselves for
     selection by that Commission. The imposition of such a





     condition being based on a misunderstanding of the

     the High Court was right in directing the Government to





     place respondents 2 to 11 in the pay-scale of 700-1100

      however to the express condition that insofar as the
      age of retirement is concerned, the present fixation of
      55 years shall continue.      The contention of the




                                          
      appellant is that the State Government having
      accepted the UGC Scheme, and as the scheme
      provides for a higher age of 60 years, all the clauses




                               
      of the scheme became applicable. It is not possible
                
      to accede to this contention. Firstly, as already stated
      the UGC Scheme does not become applicable
               
      because of any statutory mandate making it
      obligatory for the Government and the Universities
      to follow the same. Therefore the State Government
      


      had the discretion either to accept or not to accept the
   



      scheme. In its discretion it has decided to accept the
      scheme, subject to the one condition, namely, insofar
      as the age of superannuation is concerned, they will





      not accept the fixation of higher age provided in the
      scheme. The State Government having thus accepted
      the scheme in the modified form, the teachers can





      only get the benefit which flows from the scheme to
      the extent to which it has been accepted by the State
      Government and the concerned Universities.             The
      appellant cannot claim that major portion of the

               satisfaction about the attitude taken by the State
                          
               Government in the mater of implementing the same.

               Government on the one hand and the University
               Grants Commission on the other. Teachers of the

               statutes   framed     under   the   relevant     statutory
   



               enactment. As long as the superannuation remains
               fixed at 55 years and so long as the State
               Government      has    not    accepted     the     UGC's





               recommendation to fix the age of superannuation at
               60 years, teachers cannot claim as a matter of right

    the Supreme Court observed that the age of retirement fixed at 55 years

    of retirement and that would be a policy function requiring considerable

     prevails here in this case. It is for that reason that we
     have extensively quoted not only the aforementioned
     letter dated 27-7-1998 but also the subsequent letters




                              
     and the further policy statement. Plain reading of all
     these is clear enough to suggest that the scheme was
                
     voluntary and it was up to the State Governments to
     accept or not to accept the scheme. Again even if the
               
     State Government accepted a part of the scheme, it
     was not necessary that all the scheme as it was, had to
      

     be accepted by the State Government. In fact the

     Government has not chosen to accept the scheme in

    comparable to the conditions in the States of Jharkhand, Bihar or




                                                  
    Karnataka, in the field of higher and technical education. In the case

    decided by the Jharkhand High Court and which has been relied upon

    by Mr.Desai, the State Government has prescribed the age of




                                        
    superannuation under Section 67 of the Jharkhand University Act
                         
    framed under Entry 25 of List III of the Constitution. In the State of
                        
    Maharashtra the age of retirement for the college / university teachers

    has not been prescribed under the Maharashtra Universities Act, 1994
      


    and the same is prescribed under the Rules framed by the State
   



    Government following the UGC Regulations. We have already dealt

    with the prevailing age of superannuation for these academicians in the





    State of Maharashtra and there has been no uniformity between the age

    of retirement for the lecturers / professors in the Government colleges /





    institutions on one hand and the lecturers / professors in the private

    colleges aided by the State Government. The universities in the State of

    Maharashtra governed by the Maharashtra Universities Act, 1994 are

    fully aided by the State Government. In our opinion, therefore, and in

    State Government's attention to bring uniformity in performance

    noted earlier, the lecturers / professors / principals in the Government

    colleges / institutions are subjected to performance review at the age of
      


    50 or 55 years as the case may be so as to decide their retention in
   



    service and continued utility and if on assessment of the entire service

    record they are found to be incompetent or of doubtful integrity, they





    are retired in public interest. The professors / principals in the private

    aided colleges as well as the universities covered by the Maharashtra





    Universities Act, 1994 are also paid from public funds and, therefore,

    all of them ought to be subjected to similar scrutiny in the public

    interest, at the age of 50 years, 55 years and 60 years so as to decide

    their continued utility for the advancement of academic standards i.e.

    petitioners that insistence on a Ph.D. degree for enhancement in the age

    of superannuation has come as a sudden jolt by the impugned GR and at

    the fag end of their career and it is without leaving any scope, despite




                                        
    their best desires and efforts, to obtain a Ph.D. degree. It was submitted
                         
    that in some cases it is possible that the teachers were genuinely
                        
    interested in enrolling themselves for Ph.D., but because of the local

    conditions in the colleges concerned, they could not do so and for the
      


    reasons not attributable to them. Number of such teachers might have
   



    otherwise contributed for higher academic standards by writing books

    or publication of research papers. There may be some teachers whose





    books form part of the syllabus and, therefore, it would be harsh to call

    upon such teacher, all of a sudden to produce a Ph.D. degree certificate.

<p id="p_78">    The insistence of the State Government on such conditions is

    unreasonable and in some cases impossible to achieve.

    policy decision to insist on a Ph.D. degree, as one of the conditions for

    the benefit of enhanced age of superannuation.               However, our

    as to subject them to performance assessment by the Committee. Such a
