ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

 


 

<p id="p_1">1.		The
present petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India has
been preferred by the petitioners    to quash and set aside the
impugned order dated 30/06/2004 passed by learned Sessions Court,
Nadiad in Criminal Revision Application No.65 of 2004 as well as the
order dated 19/05/2003 passed in POL Case No.1 of 2003 in exercise of
powers under <a href="/doc/1405190/" id="a_2">Section 145</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_2">2.		After
the matter was argued for sometime, Mr.Asim Pandya, learned advocate
appearing on behalf of the petitioners does not press the present
petition and seeks permission to withdraw the present petition.
However, he has requested to make suitable observations that the
proceedings before the Mamlatdar under the Tenancy Act be considered 
 in accordance with law and on merits. He has also requested that
whatever order of status quo is granted, the same be continued till
final disposal of the tenancy proceedings. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_3">3.		Mr.Kinariwala,
learned advocate appearing on behalf of the contesting private
respondent has submitted that  he has no objection, if the
petitioners are permitted to withdraw the present petition and status
quo is directed to be continued till tenancy proceedings are decided
by the Mamlatdar. However, he has submitted that in view of the
withdrawal of the present petition, findings of the learned
Magistrate, which have been confirmed by the learned Revisional Court
shall be continued and are not affected. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_4">4.		In
view of the above, the present petition is dismissed as withdrawn. It
goes without saying that the concerned authority under the Tenancy
Act is bound to consider the dispute with respect to tenancy in
accordance with law and on merits. Until the proceedings are
concluded by the Tenancy Court, the order of status quo which has
been granted by this Court in the tenancy proceedings are hereby
directed to be continued. However, it is clear that the observations
of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate and confirmed by Revisional Court in
the order dated 30/06/2004 still remains. Rule is discharged.
