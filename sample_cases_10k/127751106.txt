AWARD(ORAL):
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">1.        By way of statement of claim filed directly in this

court under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_1">section 10(4A)</a> of the Industrial

Disputes Act, the workman sought reinstatement of his

services with continuity and back wages.        As pleaded by

workman, he had been in employment of the management

since the year 1986 as counter sales man at a monthly salary

of Rs 2100/-.      When the workman        demanded statutory

benefits, the management got annoyed and orally terminated

his services on 28.1.04.       Despite intervention of labour

authorities and service of demand notice, management did not

reinstate service of the workman. Hence this claim.

</p><p id="p_6">2.        Management in their written statement mainly

pleaded    that    it is the workman who had          voluntarily

abandoned    his   services   and    the   management      never

terminated the same.
</p>
<p id="p_7">3.        After framing issues my ld Predecessor posted the

matter for trial. At the stage of recording workman's evidence,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span>

compromise efforts were done on 3.7.2008 which culminated

successfully and parties moved a Memorandum of Settlement

in court today.
</p>
<p id="p_8">4.        In terms with settlement arrived at, management

paid to the workman today in court a cash sum of Rs 5,000/-

and a cheque of Rs 15,000/- towards full and final settlement

of all his claims pertaining to this case including his claim for

reinstatement of service.
</p>
<p id="p_9">5.        Statements of both the sides were recorded in the

course whereof they brought on record the Memorandum of

Settlement as Ex X and stated that now no dispute remains

pending between them.       Management is directed to    ensure

that the compromise cheque given to the workman today gets

duly honored.
</p>
<p id="p_10">6.        In view of above circumstances, it is held that the

dispute between the parties stands completely settled and now

the workman is not entitled to any relief against the

management. Claim petition is disposed of as compromised.
