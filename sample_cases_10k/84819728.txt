<p id="p_1">             The   case   set   up   by    the   petitioner       is   that

respondent No.3 is affiliated to Central Board of Secondary

Education and is covered under the definition of School as

per <a href="/doc/10988277/" id="a_1">Section 2(n)(iv)</a> of the Right of Children to Free and

Compulsory Education Act, 2009 [for short 'the Act'] and

since the petitioner belongs to the Economic Weaker Section

[for short 'EWS'], therefore, as per Rule 134 of the Haryana

School     Education   Rules,    2009     [for   short     'the   Rules'],

respondent No.3 is not only obliged to declare the result of

the ward of the petitioner of Class III, but also to promote him

in Class IV without asking for a sum of `15,000/- towards

fee/charges of Class III.       It is submitted that petitioner is

working as driver in the Civil Hospital Ballabgarh, Faridabad

on   D.C.    rates.    Respondent      No.3/School     is   in   the

neighbourhood and is within the radius of 2 Kms from the

residence of the petitioner and being privately un-aided

school is covered under the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            After notice, respondent No.3 has filed its reply, in

which it is urged that the School is being run by 'IDICULA

TRUST SOCIETY' which is registered on 6.7.1971 and has

been declared to be Minority Educational Institution by virtue

of the certificate dated 27.7.2012 issued by the National

Commission     for    Minority    Educational    Institutions.   The

certificate reads thus: -

</p><p id="p_4">           Learned counsel for respondent No.3 has further

argued that the School is Unaided Minority Institution and is

not covered under the Act, as <a href="/doc/1464892/" id="a_4">Section 2(n)(iv)</a> of the Act covers

an unaided school, not receiving any kind of aid or grants to

meet its expenses from the appropriate Government or the

local authority, but it does not cover the schools which are

unaided minority institutions.
</p>
<p id="p_5">           In this regard, he has relied upon a decision of the

Supreme Court in the case of W.P.(C) 95 of 2010 titled as

"Society for Un-aided Private Schools of Rajasthan Vs.

Union of India and another" decided on 12.4.2012, in

which the following conclusion has been arrived at by the

Apex Court: -

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                   (iii)   a     school     belonging     to

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">              However, the said 2009 Act and in

              particular <a href="/doc/1205463/" id="a_5">Sections 12(1)(c)</a> and <a href="/doc/1608424/" id="a_6">18(3)</a>

              infringes    the     fundamental      freedom

              guaranteed to unaided minority schools

              under <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_7">Article 30(1)</a> and, consequently,

              applying the <a href="/doc/725224/" id="a_8">R.M.D. Chamarbaugwalla

              v. Union of        India</a> [1957 SCR 930]

              principle of severability, the said 2009

              Act shall not apply to such schools.

              This judgment will operate from today.

              In other words, this will apply from the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> CWP No.10273 of 2012                                     -5-</span>



                 academic       year         2012-13.    However,

                 admissions given by unaided minority

                 schools prior to the pronouncement of

                 this judgment shall not be reopened."</blockquote><p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">           After hearing learned counsel for the parties and

perusing the record, I am of the considered opinion that

though the Act is applicable to the unaided private schools as

per <a href="/doc/1464892/" id="a_9">Section 2(n)(iv)</a>of the Act but in view of the decision of the

Supreme Court, in the case of Society for Un-aided Private

Schools of Rajasthan (Supra), it would not apply to the

Unaided Minority Institutions.
</p>
<p id="p_8">           Consequently, respondent No.3, being an Unaided

Private Minority Institution, is not covered by the Act and

therefore, the prayer made by the petitioner cannot be

allowed under the provisions of the Act. Hence, present writ

petition is found to be without any merit and the same is

hereby dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
