                         Mr. Pingal Bhattacharyya

                                       Re : C.A.N. 3039 of 2014
                This   application         has       been   filed    in   connection

           with the appeal whereby a learned Judge of this court

           while adjourning the hearing of the writ petition

           vacated     the       subsisting           interim       order    without

           assigning any reason. Furthermore, no one was present

           on   behalf      of   the   respondents          before    the    learned

           Single Judge and therefore, no prayer also could be

           made for vacating the subsisting interim order.

</p><p id="p_2">                From the records we find that another learned

           Judge of this court by the order dated 29th July, 2011

           granted interim order upon realising that the very

           purpose     of    the    writ    petition        will    be    frustrated

           unless such interim order is granted. The relevant

           extract from the order dated 29th July, 2011 passed by

           the learned Single Judge is quoted hereunder:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                             2</span>


        "Since this court is in seisin of the matter and
        if the Respondents are allowed to grant a licence
        in the meantime to any other person, the very
        purpose of the Writ Petition will stand frustrated
        and therefore, and as prayed for, till further
        Orders are passed, the Respondents shall maintain
        status quo as existing today."
</p>
<p id="p_3">
       Mr.     Debabrata           Saha          Roy,      learned        Counsel

representing the appellants/petitioners submits that

the    learned       counsel          of    the    appellants-petitioners

was    ready        and    willing         to     proceed      with     the    writ

petition before the learned Single Judge.

</p><p id="p_4">        In any event, the learned Single Judge did not

dismiss       the     writ       petition         and     only    vacated      the

subsisting          interim        order          without       assigning      any

reason, which we cannot approve.

</p><p id="p_5">        Learned Single Judge should not have vacated

the interim order which was passed as far back on

29th    July,       2011    by    another         learned       Judge     of   this

Court        upon    considering             the     submissions          of   the

respective parties herein. Furthermore, it is also

not    in     dispute       that       no       prayer    for    vacating      the

interim       order       was    made       before       the    learned    Single

Judge on behalf of the respondents at any point of

time     and    the        impugned         order       was    passed     by   the

learned Single Judge vacating the interim order even

in     absence        of        the        learned        advocate       of    the

respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        For the aforementioned reasons, we modify the

impugned order passed by the learned Single Judge by

directing the parties herein to maintain status quo
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                          3</span>



as on date till the disposal of the writ petition on

merits.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     With    the    aforesaid       observations   and

modification of the order under appeal, we dispose

of both the application as well as the appeal upon

treating the said appeal as on day's list.

</p><p id="p_8">     In the facts of the present case, there will be

no order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     Let urgent xerox certified copy of this order,

if applied for, be given to the learned Advocate of

the parties on usual undertaking.
