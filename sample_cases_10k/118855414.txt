_____________________________________________________
For Petitioner(s)     : Mr. Pritam Joshi
_____________________________________________________
           HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE NIRMALJIT KAUR
                          Judgment / Order
06/02/2017

     Heard.

     It is contended that the petitioner had been appointed on the

post of computer operator with machine and had gained an

experience on the said post of more than three years. The

services of petitioner came to be terminated thereafter. A circular

dated 04.03.2016, has been issued in which it was specified that

preference would be given to those candidates who had gained
                                  (2 of 2)
                                                              [CW-8/2017]

experience on the post of computer operator.

      The petitioner and other computer operators had preferred a

writ petition in this court seeking appointment on the basis of the

circular that was issued, however, the same was dismissed. The

CMHO, Barmer, has issued directions to appoint similarly situated

candidates as petitioner on the post of computer operator, but

appointment has not been offered to the petitioner. The petitioner

has already moved a representation in this regard seeking

appointment as has been offered to other similarly situated

candidates.

      Mr. Pritam Joshi, counsel for petitioner, submits that the

representation, which has been submitted should be decided as

expeditiously as possible by taking into account the appointment

that has been offered to other similarly situated.

      In view of the fact that the prayer made is limited, this writ

petition is disposed of with a direction that in case any fresh

representation is filed by the petitioner along with certified copy of

this order, the representation be decided by passing a speaking

order within a period of three weeks.

      In case any grievance still survives the petitioner is at liberty

to avail appropriate remedy.

                                            (NIRMALJIT KAUR), J.
