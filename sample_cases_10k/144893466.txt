                                                             .

</blockquote>




<p id="p_13">    2.           It is averred that though in the grounds of the writ





    petition, particularly in para 12(ii) thereof, the applicant had submitted

    that the Deputy Commissioner in absence of any provision for review

    could not have reviewed his order and therefore, the order passed by





    him was without jurisdiction and illegal. But due to inadvertence,

    specific prayer for quashing the same could not be made

    necessitating filing of the present application.

</p><p id="p_14">    3.           The appellants, who are the writ respondents have filed

    their reply wherein preliminary objection has been taken to the effec t



    that the applicant cannot be permitted to fill in the lacunae of his case.

    The application should be bonafide one and should not cause




    injustice to the other party.     The same should be necessary for





    determining the real question in controversy and since the proposed





    amendment does not qualify any of the aforesaid conditions,

    therefore, the same should be dismissed. It is further contended that

    the application is misconceived as the amendment is now sought at

    the LPA stage and ought to have been moved before the learned writ

    court.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                 We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and

    have gone through the records of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_16">    4.           No doubt, the amendment has been sought when the

    matter is in appeal, but the proposed amendment is only formal since

    it only seeks to add an additional prayer in the relief clause, for which

    the foundations have already been laid not only in the writ petition but




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                          ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 18:05:41 :::HCHP</span>

</p>
<p id="p_17">
    also in the grounds taken therein. It is trite that amendment can

    be allowed at any stage of the proceedings. Therefore, we see no




                                                             .
</p>
<p id="p_18">    reason    why    the amendment should         not     be allowed         as     no

    prejudice will be caused to the non-applicant(s) by amending only





    the relief clause.
</p>
<p id="p_19">    5.            Accordingly, the present application is allowed and the





    amended writ petition is ordered to be taken on record. The learned

    counsel for the non-applicants (appellants herein) states that they do

    not intend to file reply(s) to the amended petition. The application


    stands disposed of.

<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">    6.            With the consent of the learned counsel for the parties,

    the appeal is taken up for hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_23">


</p><p id="p_24">    7.            This Letters Patent Appeal is directed against the





    judgment passed by the writ Court in CWP No. 523 of 2006 on

    6.8.2007 whereby after setting aside the order passed by the Deputy





    Commissioner as affirmed by the Financial Commissioner (Appeals),

    the writ petition filed by respondent No.1 was allowed and the sale of

    property made in favour of the appellants by proforma respondent

    Lakhu was declared null and void and the State Government was

    directed to resume the land.
</p>
<p id="p_25">    8.            In brief, the facts of the case are that one Lakhu alias

    Amru was granted Nautor of land measuring 3-12-16 bighas on

    13.11.1980 under the Himachal Pradesh Grant of Nautor Land to

    Landless Persons and Other Eligible Persons Scheme, 1975 (for

    short 'Scheme'). Though, mutation to this effect was also entered in

</p>
<p id="p_27">    29.11.1995 sold a portion of this land measuring 0-7-5 bighas in

    favour of appellant   No. 1 Rajinder. Another sale was effected on





    30.5.1996 in favour of other appellant Lachhman Dass, who died and

    his legal representatives have been brought on record and are now





    appellants No. 3 to 7 and lastly a sale deed was executed on

    8.7.1996 in favour of Roop Lal, appellant No.2.

</p><p id="p_28">    9.           Aggrieved by the grant of Nautor as also the alienation


    made by Lakhu, the respondent No.1 claiming himself to be an estate

    right holder of the mouza concerned, preferred a petition                  under


    <a href="/doc/1750198/" id="a_1">Section 11</a> of the Scheme, whereby he not only challenged the grant

    of Nautor made in favour of Lakhu but also challenged the aforesaid




    sale deeds made by him in favour of the appellants as being in





    violation of Clause 11 of the Scheme which imposed an embargo on

    alienation for a period of 20 years from the grant.





</p><p id="p_29">    10.          Vide order dated 26.6.2000 the Deputy Commissioner

    held the sale deeds dated 30.5.1996 and 8.7.1996 to be valid but the

    sale deed dated 29.11.1995 was declared to be null and void being

    hit by Clause 11 of the Scheme after holding that the restriction

    period prescribed therein was not 20 years but was 15 years and

    accordingly the subject matter of the sale deed was ordered to be

    resumed by the State Government.
</p>
<p id="p_30">    11.          However, against the aforesaid order, the appellant No.1

    Divisional Officer (Civil) of the Sub Division and the Tehsldar of the

</p><p id="p_46">    21.          Once the land itself had been sanctioned on 31.3.1981,


    then in no event could the mutation have been attested anterior to

    this date i.e. 13.11.1980. If that be so, then the order passed by




    the Deputy Commissioner        in the review petition was absolutely





    wrong whereby he had construed the period of 15 years (which

    was otherwise 20 years) from the date of mutation instead of the

    notification No. Rev.2-A(3)11/77 dated 11.9.1980 was 20 years as

    respondent could not have transferred          the    land      in     favour of

    appellants within the period of 20 years, the Deputy Commissioner

    had no other option but should have cancelled           the land allotted in

<p id="p_50">    23.          The order passed by the Deputy Commissioner in the

    is well settled that power of review is not an inherent power. Right to

    aggrieved party. Such power must be conferred by the law. If there

    is no power of review, the order cannot be reviewed.

<p id="p_52">    25.          There is yet another reason why the subsequent order

    dated 20.11.2000 passed by the Deputy Commissioner in the review





    petition cannot be sustained. The Deputy Commissioner after

    pronouncing, notifying and communicating the initial order dated

    26.6.2000 became functus officio and could not thereafter revise/

    review/ modify the said order. It is only the higher forum that could

    have varied the order. In obser ving so, we draw support from the



    following observations of Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1539259/" id="a_10">State Bank of

    India and others vs. S.N.Goyal</a> (2008) 8 SCC 92, wherein it has




    been held as follows:-

<p id="p_53">



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">                "25.   The learned counsel for respondent contended that the
                Appointing Authority became functus officio once he passed the





                order dated 18.1.1995 agreeing with the penalty proposed by the
                Disciplinary Authority and cannot thereafter revise/review/modify
                the said order. Reliance was placed on the English decision Re :
                VGM Holdings Ltd, reported in 1941 (3) All. ER page 417 wherein it
                was held that once a Judge has made an order which has been
                passed and entered, he becomes functus officio and cannot
                thereafter vary the terms of his order and only a higher court,
                tribunal can vary it. What is significant is that decision does not
                say that the Judge becomes functus officio when he passes the
                order, but only when the order passed is 'entered'. The term
                'entering judgment' in English Law refers to the procedure in
                civil courts in which a judgment is formally recorded by court after it
                has been given.

<blockquote id="blockquote_25">        as to at what stage, an Authority becomes functus officio in regard
        to an order made by him. P. Ramanatha Aiyar's Advance Law

<blockquote id="blockquote_27">                "Thus a Judge, when he has decided a question brought
        before him, is functus officio, and cannot review his own decision."

<blockquote id="blockquote_28">        27.     Black's Law Dictionary (Sixth Edition Page 673) gives its
        meaning as follows :
</blockquote>




<blockquote id="blockquote_29">                "Having fulfilled the function, discharged the office, or
                accomplished the purpose, and therefore, of no further force
                or authority".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">        28.      We may first refer to the position with reference to civil

        courts. Order XX of Code of Civil Procedure deals with judgment

        and decree. Rule 1 explains when a judgment is pronounced. Sub-
        rule (1) provides that the Court, after the case has been heard, shall
        pronounce judgment in an open court either at once, or as soon
        thereafter as may be practicable, and when the judgment is to be



        pronounced on some future day, the court shall fix a day for that
        purpose of which due notice shall be given to the parties or their




        pleaders. Sub-rule (3) provides that the judgment may be
        pronounced by dictation in an open court to a shorthand writer (if





        the Judge is specially empowered in this behalf). The proviso
        thereto provides that where the judgment is pronounced by
        dictation in open court, the transcript of the judgment so





        pronounced shall, after making such corrections as may be
        necessary, be signed by the Judge, bear the date on which it was
        pronounced and form a part of the record. Rule 3 provides that the
        judgment shall be dated and signed by the Judge in open court at
        the time of pronouncing it and when once signed, shall not
        afterwards be altered or added to save as provided by <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_11">section 152</a>
        or on review. Thus where a judgment is reserved, mere dictation
        does not amount to pronouncement, but where the judgment is
        dictated in open court, that itself amounts to pronouncement. But
        even after such pronouncement by open court dictation, the Judge
        can make corrections before signing and dating the judgment.
        Therefore, a Judge becomes functus officio when he pronounces,
        signs and dates the judgment (subject to <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_12">section 152</a> and power of
        review). The position is different with reference to quasi judicial
        authorities. While some quasi judicial tribunals fix a day for
        pronouncement and pronounce their orders on the day fixed, many
        quasi judicial authorities do not pronounce their orders. Some

<blockquote id="blockquote_31">                publish or notify their orders. Some prepare and sign the orders and
                communicate the same to the party concerned. A quasi judicial

<blockquote id="blockquote_32">                pronounced, or published/notified or communicated (put in the

                made in an office noting in a file but is not pronounced, published or





                communicated, nothing prevents the Authority from correcting it or
                altering it for valid reasons. But once the order is pronounced or
                published or notified or communicated, the Authority will become
                functus officio. The order dated 18.1.1995 made on an office note,





                was neither pronounced, nor published/notified nor communicated.
                Therefore, it cannot be said that the Appointing Authority became
                functus officio when he signed the note on dated 18.1.1995."

    impropriety or illegality in the order passed by the learned writ court

    dismissed, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
