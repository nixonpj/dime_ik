                    respondent/ State.</pre>

<p id="p_3">                           This is first application filed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> of Cr.P.C. for grant of
                    bail to the applicant, as he has been arrested in connection with Crime
                    No.290/2019 registered at Police Station Chipabad, District Harda for the
                    offence punishable under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_2">Sections 498-A</a>, <a href="/doc/594493/" id="a_3">294</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_4">323</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_5">506</a> of the IPC and

</p><p id="p_4">                           Allegation of the prosecution is that marriage of the applicant was
                    solemnized with complainant Girija Vishnoi in the year 2006. It is alleged that
                    out of their wedlock, one daughter aged 9 years and one son aged 7 years
                    were born. It is alleged that the applicant was of greedy nature and he used to

                    force the complainant since beginning to bring more money and car etc. as
                    dowry and on account of non-fulfillment of his demand, the applicant used to
                    beat her repeatedly. It is also stated that the applicant had illicit relationship
                    with some other girl residing in village Khategaon. The applicant was
                    threatening the complainant to kill her by pouring kerosene. Two days before
                    the date of incident, the applicant had beaten the complainant. The
                    complainant after coming to her parental home lodged a report at the police
                    station against the applicant.
</p><p id="p_5">                           It is submitted by the learned counsel for the applicant that the
                    applicant is innocent. He has not committed any offence. He has falsely been
                    implicated in the case. He is in judicial custody since 26.8.2019. The trial will
                    take time to conclude. There is no likelihood of his absconding or tampering
                    with the prosecution witnesses. Therefore, it is prayed that the applicants be

                    fact that the applicant is in judicial custody since 26.8.2019, in my opinion, it
                    is a fit case for grant of bail, hence, without commenting on merits of the
                    case, this application is allowed.

                    personal bond in the sum of Rs.30,000/- (Rupees Thirty Thousand only)
                    along with one solvent surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial
                    Court to appear before the Court on the dates given by the concerned Court.
