                  Judgment / Order
21/12/2016

     Petitioners have filed this petition under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section

439</a> Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 seeking regular

bail in F.I.R. No.219/2016 registered at Police Station

Bhatta Basti District Jaipur, for offence under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_2">Section

306</a> Indian Penal Code 1860.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     Learned    counsel     for     the     petitioners   has

submitted that the petitioners are the paternal aunts

of the deceased. Petitioner No.2 is a divorcee and was

looking after the deceased and his brothers and sister

as their mother had left the matrimonial home.

Brother   of   the    petitioners    i.e.   father   of   the

complainant had died in the year 2005. After the

death of the grandfather of the complainant, mother

of the complainant came back and started residing
 with her children. Due to this reason property dispute

arose between the parties. Deceased is the nephew of

the petitioners and has committed suicide and has

died due to burn injuries. No suicide note was left by

the deceased. Petitioners have been falsely involved in

this case on account of property dispute between the

parties. Fixed Deposit Receipts had been got prepared

by petitioner No.2 in the sum of Rupees Four lacs each

in the name of Mohit Tank (deceased). Learned

counsel has further submitted that the grandfather of

the complainant had never invested Rupees Fifty Lacs

in   Fixed   Deposit   Receipt   in   the   name   of   the

deceased.Pettioners are in custody since 18.12.2016.

Presently petitioners are in judicial custody and are

not required for further investigation.

opposed the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">       Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of

the present case, it would be just and expedient to

order release of the petitioners on bail.


</p><p id="p_7">       Accordingly, without expressing any opinion on

the merits of the case, this petition is allowed.

Petitioners be admitted to bail subject to satisfaction

of the Trial Court.
