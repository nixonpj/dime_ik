              learned    Senior          counsel    for       the    petitioner

              petitioner       facing      allegation          under       <a href="/doc/329571/" id="a_1">Section

              392</a>     I.P.C.       was    earlier        rejected       on    two

              one   being      10.9.2008,          wherein         liberty    was

              given    to     the    petitioner          to    move    after     a

              period of nine months.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                            The court below in its report dated

              8.10.2009       at     flag-'Y'      has    stated       that     on

              account of non-appearance on the part of the

              accused        Bipin     Kumar    as       also       absence    of

              Kundan    Kumar        Sharma     the      trial       could    not

              progress       though      five   prosecution           witnesses

              were produced by the A.P.P. on 29.7.2009. It

              also appears that the accused Bipin Kumar

              had     been     taken      on    remand        on     his     being

              produced in a case pending against him at

              Daltonganj       and       therefore,       the       trial    could

              not progress for a period commencing from

6.12.2008 when he was sent to Daltonganj and

until 15.9.2009 when he had returned back

from Daltonganj. From the latest report of

the   Jail    Superintendent         dated    5.1.2010   it

however      appears    that     after       return    from

Daltonganj the condition of the petitioner

has somewhat deteriorated and it is said he

is not in a position to do his daily routine

duties on account of mental ailment.

</p><p id="p_4">             Considering        the         aforementioned

aspects and the report of the trial court at

Flag-'Y'      dated    8.10.2009        informing      this

Court   that    it    would    make    all    endeavor   to

complete the trial within a period of six

months, while this Court is not inclined to

grant regular bail to the petitioner for the

present, it would however make it clear that

if the trial of the petitioner is not taken

up on day to day basis and concluded within

three        months      from         the      date      of

receipt/production of a copy of this order,

the   petitioner       would    at    liberty     to   move

afresh for bail before the trial court and

this time the trial court would be obliged

to record the reasons for not concluding the

trial and only thereafter the petitioner may
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            3</span>




            renew his prayer for bail before this Court.

            and    direction,      this       application    is

            dismissed.

            compliance.
