:ORDER  
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        Ravi Patayar, a resident of Vadaku Ammapettai, Poolangulathupatti Post,
Ramji Nagar via., Trichy District, seeks a direction, directing the
respondents to accord permission to conduct Karaka dance programme in  
Arulmigu Sri Mahasakthi Mariyamman Temple, Vadaku Ammapettai Village,    
Poolangulathupatti Taluk, Trichy District on 17.07.2016.
</p><p id="p_2">        2.According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, Karaka dance is
the traditional dance in this State.  Many people like and love to see Karaka
dance.  It is being conducted regularly in Mariyamman Temple festival situate
at Vadaku Ammapettai Village, Poolangulathupatti Taluk, Trichy District.  No
obscenity will be practised by the Karaka dancers.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, as early as on
11.07.2016, a representation has been given to the respondents, as on date,
no order has been passed.  The function is fast approaching.  Learned counsel
for the petitioner further submitted that in no way they are going to
obstruct public flow of life nor affect public peace and tranquillity and
they are maintaining law and order.  In such circumstances, withholding of
granting permission is as against law.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.The learned Additional Government Pleader appearing for the
respondents submitted that as the area is prone to commission of offences
under <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_2">Prohibition Act</a> and it will create law and order. In such
circumstances, the permission was refused.

order and also the materials on record.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6.The history of Karaka dance is age old.  Even during our Tamil Kings
period, this dance has been performed.  But at the same time, under the
pretext of conducting Karaka dance, violation of provisions of law cannot be
permitted.  On the one hand, traditional art must be developed.  On the other
hand, commission of crime should not be developed.  So the Karaka dance can 
be permitted.  But it must be regulated by the law enforcing authority.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        7.Granting of permission to conduct Karaka dance during the said
festival can be considered as per law.  But it should not be at the cost of
public tranquillity.

Enamkulathur Police Station, Trichy District, is directed to pass orders on
