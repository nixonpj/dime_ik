<pre id="pre_1">         IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA
            CIRCUIT BENCH AT DHARWAD

       DATED THIS THE 13TH DAY OF JUNE, 2013

                        BEFORE

        THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE B.MANOHAR

                  C.P. No.572 OF 2012

BETWEEN:
Renuka w/o.Shivakumar Yalavatti
Age 29 years, Occ:Household
R/o.Annigeri, now at Bentur
Tq &amp; Dist:Gadag.                           ..Petitioner
(By Sri H N Gularaddi, Adv.)

AND:
Shivakumar s/o.Channappa Yalavatti
Age 35 years, Occ:Police Constable
DAR Police Buckle No.202
Now r/o.DAR Office, Mallasamudra
Tq &amp; Dist:Gadag.                         ... Respondent

(By Smt.K K Teragunti, Adv.)

      This CP is filed u/s.24 of CPC, praying to transfer
MC No.31/2012 pending on the file of the I Additional
Civil Judge (Sr.Dn.) &amp; Addl. CJM, Navalgund to Principal
Senior Civil Judge, Gadag.

     This CP coming on for admission this day, the Court
passed following:
                               2




                       ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     This civil petition is filed under Section 24 of CPC

seeking for transfer of M.C. No.31/2012 pending on the

file of the I Additional Civil Judge (Sr.Dn.) &amp; Addl. CJM,

Navalgund to Principal Senior Civil Judge, Gadag.



</p><p id="p_2">2.   The grievance of the petitioner is that petitioner and

the respondent are legally wedded wife and husband.

Their marriage was solemnized on 23.6.2007 at Annigeri.

Out of the said wedlock, two children were born.

Thereafter, the respondent demanded dowry and started

harassing the petitioner. The petitioner was thrown out of

the marital house, hence she filed a Crl.Misc.No.133/2011

under <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_1">Section 125</a> of Cr.PC on the file of JMFC, Gadag,

seeking for maintenance. After the receipt of notice, the

respondent/husband filed MC No.31/2012 on the file of

the Senior Civil Judge, Navalgund, for restitution of

conjugal rights. She finds it very difficult to appear before

the Family Court, Navaglund without any male help. After
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span>



she was thrown out from the marital house, she is under

the mercy of her aged old parents.          Though the interim

maintenance has been ordered, the same is not being paid

regularly.    In order to harass the petitioner, M.C.

No.31/2012 has been filed on the file of the Senior Civil

Judge, Navalgund.      Hence, she has filed this petition

praying to transfer of M.C. No.31/2012 pending on the file

of the Senior Civil Judge, Navalgund to the Principal

Senior Civil Judge at Gadag.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">3.    The respondent contended that Navalgund is very

close to the place of the residence of the petitioner and the

petitioner is the permanent resident of Annigeri. Further,

the   respondent   has   paid       the   interim   maintenance

regularly.   The respondent is ready and willing to take

back his wife and sought for dismissal of the transfer

petition.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                4</span><p id="p_5">



</p><p id="p_6">4.    I have carefully considered the arguments addressed

the learned counsel for the petitioner and the respondent

and perused the averments made in the petition.



</p><p id="p_7">5.    It is not in dispute that the petitioner and the

respondent are legally wedded wife and husband. Out of

the wedlock, two children were born.          Thereafter, the

dispute has been started between them with regard to

demand of dowry. The allegation of the petitioner is that

the respondent has thrown her out from the marital

house. The petitioner was under the care and custody of

her father. In order to maintain herself, she has filed the

petition   under   <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_2">Section   125</a>    of   Cr.PC   seeking    for

maintenance. As a counter blast, the respondent has filed

the petitioner under <a href="/doc/322349/" id="a_3">Section 9</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act.

There is no bonafide in the claim made by the respondent.

Further, it is very difficult for the petitioner to travel from

Gadag to Navalgund whenever the case is posted.            The

distance between the said places is 50 kms. She cannot
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                5</span>



travel alone to Navalgund to defend her case. There is

some substance in the submission of the Advocate

appearing for the petitioner. The petition for maintenance

filed by the petitioner is pending in the Court at Gadag.

The petition filed under <a href="/doc/322349/" id="a_4">Section 9</a> of the Hindu Marriage

Act by the respondent is at Navalgund. It is difficult for

the petitioner to appear for both the cases one at

Navalgund and another is at Gadag.             It is just and

necessary to transfer M.C.No.31/2012 pending on the file

of the I Additional Civil Judge (Sr.Dn.) and Addl. CJM,

Navalgund to the Principal Senior Civil Judge, Gadag.

Hence, I pass the following:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                             ORDER


     This civil petition is allowed.</blockquote><p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">     MC No.31/2012 filed by the respondent pending on

the file of the I Additional Civil Judge (Sr.Dn.) and Addl.

CJM, Navalgund is ordered to be transferred to the

Principal   Senior   Civil   Judge,    Gadag   to   enable   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            6</span>



petitioner to prosecute the cases.   The Principal Senior

Civil Judge, Gadag is directed to dispose of the same in

accordance with law.
