           HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIJAY BISHNOI

                       Judgment / Order

12/09/2018

     Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the

impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that it is

clear from the statement of PW.10 - Kuldeep Walia that the

Seizure Officer first took out small quantity of poppy husk from

each bags, recovered from two vehicles, then he mixed the said

poppy husk on a tarpaulin, and thereafter took two samples from

that mixture. Thus, it is clear that the Seizure Officer did not

collect separate samples from each bags. It is also submitted that

the I.O. has not stated that the test by the U.N. Kit was carried

out on each bag before taking small quantity of poppy husk for

samples.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     Learned counsel for the appellants while placing reliance on

the decision of this Court rendered in the case of Netram Vs.

State of Rajasthan, reported in 2014(1) Cr.L.R. (Raj.) 163

has argued that this Court has held that if the samples from each

bag containing poppy husk/poppy straw have not been collected

and test by U.N.Kit has not been conducted on each bag and if the

Seizure Officer has taken out some quantity of narcotic drug from

each bag and after mixing the same has taken out some portion

for sample, then, the same is not in conformity with the Standing

Instruction No.1/88 issued by the Narcotics Control Bureau, New

Delhi, particularly, Instruction No.1.7 and, as such, the accused

persons cannot be held guilty for possession of narcotic drugs of

commercial quantity. It is also argued that each of the appellants

has undergone sentence of four years, three months and six days
                           (3 of 4)



as on 30.8.2018 and no other case of similar nature is pending

against them. It is, thus, prayed that the sentence of the accused

appellants may be suspended.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the

applications for suspension of sentence.

</p><p id="p_14">     Having considered the overall facts and circumstances of the

case and substantial grounds taken in the appeals and taking into

consideration the judgment passed by this Court in Netram's

case (supra), this Court is of the opinion that there are strong

grounds for challenging the judgment of conviction and as hearing

of the appeals is likely to take time, this Court is inclined to

suspend the sentences awarded to the appellants.

</p><p id="p_15">     Accordingly, these applications for suspension of sentences

are allowed and it is directed that the sentences awarded to

appellants - Kor Singh @ Sanju son of Kuldeep Singh, Balwant

Singh son of Balveer Singh, Bobby @ Roshan son of Pali Singh,

Smt. Paramjeet Kaur wife of Shri Satpal Singh and Karam Singh

son of Shri Sarjeet Singh by the Special Judge (NDPS Act Cases) &amp;

Addl. Sessions Judge, Ratangarh, Distt. Churu by judgment dated

23.1.2018 shall remain suspended till final disposal of the

aforesaid appeals provided each of them executes a personal bond

for a sum of Rs.50,000/- along with two solvent sureties in the

sum of Rs.25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial

court for their appearance before this Court on 12.10.2018 and

whenever called upon to do so till the disposal of the appeals on

the conditions inidcated below:-
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      (1) That he/she/they will appear before the trial court in
      the month of January of every year till the appeal is
      decided.

                                         (2) That if the applicant(s) changes the place of residence,
                                         he/she/they will give in writing his/her/their changed
                                         address to the trial court as well as to the counsel in the
                                         High Court.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                         (3) Similarly, if the sureties change their address(s), they
                                         will give in writing their changed address(s) to the trial
                                         court.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                        The learned trial court shall keep the record of attendance of
                                   the accused-applicant(s) in a separate file. Such file be registered
                                   as Criminal Misc. Case related to original case in which the
                                   accused-applicant(s) was/were tried and convicted. A copy of this
                                   order shall also be placed in that file for ready reference. Criminal
                                   Misc. file shall not be taken into account for statistical purpose
                                   relating to pendency and disposal of cases in the trial court. In
                                   case the said accused-applicant(s) does not appear before the trial
                                   court, the learned trial Judge shall report the matter to the High
                                   Court for cancellation of bail.</blockquote><p id="p_17">
