      Suit No. 618/10

Smt. Kajal &amp; Ors.                                          ...Petitioners

      Vs.

Sh. Manoj Kumar Jain &amp; Ors.                             ...Respondents</pre>


<p id="p_1">INTERIM AWARD U/S 140 OF M.V. ACT

      Sh. Surender Kumar @ Ravi sustained fatal injuries in a road side
accident on 10.11.2010 at Pushta Road, near Shamshan Ghat, Geeta
Colony, PS Geeta Colony, which allegedly took place due to rash and
negligent driving of Wagon R Car bearing registration No. HR-51-
AC-2570. The plea of the petitioners is that accident took place due to
sole negligence of the driver of the offending vehicle. The petitioners
claimed interim compensation from the respondents being driver, owner
and insurance company of the offending vehicle.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.    Respondent No. 3/Insurance company has admitted that offending
vehicle was insured with it vide policy No. 460289135 for the period from
05.02.2010 to 04.02.2011.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.    I heard arguments of Ld. Counsels for the parties and perused file.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.    PW-1 Smt. Kajal, wife of deceased has stated that the petitioners
are the only legal representatives of the deceased.
</p>

<p id="p_5">5.    <a href="/doc/32775809/" id="a_1">Section 140</a> of the M.V. Act provides no fault liability. For getting
interim relief under this section, the Tribunal is only required to see
primafacie the factum of accident involving the offending vehicle and

Suit No. 618/10                                                   Page 1/2
 factum of death of the person in the impugned accident. To prove this the
petitioners relied upon the copy of FIR No. 299 dated 10.11.2010
recorded at P.S. Geeta Colony, which is regarding the impugned accident.
The petitioners also relied upon certified copy of MLC of deceased
prepared soon after the accident and postmortem was conducted as
referred case on the basis of same MLC.         Therefore the only logical
presumption to be drawn at this stage is that deceased has suffered
unnatural death on account of road accident.
</p>

<p id="p_6">6.     The contents of FIR and P/M report primafacie establish that
deceased sustained fatal injuries in the above referred accident involving
offending vehicle. Therefore, I hold that petitioners have established their
claim for interim compensation. Accordingly, I allow interim compensation
of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) to the petitioners together
with interest @ 7.5% from the date of filing of petition i.e. 27.11.2010 till
the date of realization.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.     All the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the
compensation to the petitioners. However Respondent No. 3 being the
insurer has primary obligation to pay compensation to the petitioners.
Respondent No. 3 is hereby directed to deposit the award amount within
one month by way of crossed cheque with this tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.     Out of the award amount petitioner no. 3 is given Rs.5000/-.
Petitioner no. 2 is given Rs.15,000/-. The entire share of petitioner no. 2
be kept in FDR till the time he attains the age of majority. The entire
balance amount of Rs.30,000/- be given to petitioner no. 1.</p><pre id="pre_2">
