                   R.S.A.No. 922              OF       2007
                   ............................................
      DATED THIS THE 12th DAY OF NOVEMBER, 2007

                               JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Plaintiffs in O.S.482 of 1996 on the file of Munsiff Court,

Pathanamthitta are the appellants. Defendant is the respondent.

Appellants instituted the suit seeking a decree for declaration of

title and recovery of possession.                  Plaint schedule property

admittedly originally belonged to deceased Reghunatha Prasad.

Appellants contended that under Ext.A6 will executed by

deceased Reghunatha Prasad, whereunder he bequeathed plaint

schedule property in their favour they have title to the plaint

schedule property and respondent has no right over the

property and appellants are entitled to a decree for declaration

of title and recovery of possession of the plaint schedule

property.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2. Respondent in the written statement disputed the claim

of appellants.   It was contended that the relationship of the

appellants with the deceased is true and Reghunatha Prasad was

a man of ill health and sickness and he had originally married

Iswarya and after his divorce with Iswarya, Reghunatha Prasad

married respondent on 18.1.1996 at Murinjamangalam temple

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">RSA 922/2007                    2</span>

and thereafter they have been living as husband and wife. It was

also contended that after solemnization of the marriage, they

entered into a marriage udampadi which was registered as

document No.6/96 of Konny SRO and Reghunatha Prasad had

not executed Ext.A6 will and it is a fabricated one. It was also

contended that Reghunatha Prasad was admitted at Aravind Eye

Hospital, Madurai for cataract surgery on 17.6.1996 and surgery

was conducted on 18.6.1996         and he was discharged on

20.6.1996 with a direction to be present there for review and on

the evening of 21.6.1996 he returned home and after returning

back, he was not physically and mentally sound to execute any

will and on 25.6.1996 respondent was at the bed-side of her

husband and he did not execute Ext.A6 on 25.6.1996 as alleged

and appellants are not entitled to the declaration or recovery of

possession sought for.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3. Learned Munsiff, on the evidence of PWs 1 to 7, Dws 1

&amp; 2, Exts.A1 to A8, Exts.B1 to B16 and Ext.X1 series upheld

Ext.A6 will and granted a decree declaring the title of appellants

and directed respondents to surrender possession of the

property. Respondents challenged the decree and judgment

before District Court, Pathanamthitta in A.S.76 of 2002.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">RSA 922/2007                      3</span>

Learned Additional District Judge, on reappreciation of evidence,

found that Ext.A6 will was not proved to be executed by

deceased Reghunatha Prasad and set aside the decree and

dismissed the suit. It is challenged in the second appeal.

</p><p id="p_4">     4. Learned counsel appearing for appellants was heard.

The argument of the learned counsel is that first appellate court

did not properly appreciate the evidence and from the evidence

of PW4, the scribe, and Pws 5 and 6, attesting witnesses,

execution of Ext.A6 will was proved and hence under Ext.A6,

appellants have title to the plaint schedule property and

respondent has no right over the same and therefore appellants

are entitled to the decree sought for. Learned counsel argued

that when trial court has appreciated the evidence in the proper

perspective and upheld Ext.A6 will, first appellate court should

not have interfered with the decree and the decree and judgment

passed by first appellate court are unsustainable.

</p><p id="p_5">     5.    On hearing the learned counsel, I do not find any

substantial question of law involved in the appeal. Appellants are

claiming title under Ext.A6 will. Only if Ext.A6 will is proved to

be the last will executed by deceased Reghunatha Prasad, of his

free will and volition appellants can succeed in their claim for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">RSA 922/2007                      4</span>

title to the plaint schedule property.      Though trial court, in

appreciation of evidence, upheld Ext.A6 will, first appellate court

on reappreciation of evidence found that evidence was not

properly appreciated by the trial court and there are

circumstances indicating that Ext.A6 will was not executed by

deceased Reghunatha Prasad and held that execution of Ext.A6

will was not proved and appellants did not have title to the

property. The argument of learned counsel is that appreciation

of evidence by first appellate court is not proper and it warrants

interference.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6. Exercising the powers under Section 100 of Code of

Civil Procedure, reappreciation of evidence is not warranted

unless appreciation of evidence by first appellate court was so

perverse that it cannot be upheld or the findings of the first

appellate court was not based on the evidence on record. First

appellate court has given cogent and convincing reasons for

setting aside the finding of trial court regarding execution of the

will. Though execution of Ext.A6 will was disputed in the written

statement and it was specifically contended that Ext.A6 will was

not executed by deceased Reghunatha Prasad and it is a

fabricated one, appellants did not send the will to an expert for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">RSA 922/2007                     5</span>

comparing the signature seen in Ext.A6 will with the admitted

signatures of deceased Reghunatha Prasad.          They sought to

prove the will by examining PW1 Manager of the Bank and by

producing Ext.A1, A2 and A7 to prove the signature. That

evidence was accepted by the trial court. First appellate court

found that a scrutiny of Ext.A6 casts doubt about its

genuineness.   A photocopy of Ext.A6 was made available by

learned counsel. A perusal of it supports the finding of first

appellate court. It is seen that the signature of the testator seen

in Ext.A6 in each of the pages is exactly at the same place and

not below the name of the testator written therein which should

ordinarily be the case indicating that it was written in papers

which were signed earlier. The way in which Ext.A6 will was

prepared and the fact that on each of the page attestors signed

all disclose a concious attempt to make it appear as genuine.

First appellate court, appreciated the evidence of Pw4, the

Scribe and Pws 5 and 6, the attesting witnesses and found that

their evidence cannot be relied on to uphold the execution. First

appellate court also found that when admittedly Reghunatha

Prasad had several bank accounts, Ext.A6 mentions only about

one account, in which respondent was shown as the nominee

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">RSA 922/2007                    6</span>

indicating that Ext.A6 was created after the death of the

deceased Reghunatha Prasad. First appellate court also pointed

out that there are factual discrepancies in Ext.A6 which would

not have been there if it was genuinely executed by the

deceased. It is for these reasons first appellate court held that

Ext.A6 will was not proved. It is a finding of fact. It cannot be

said that the finding was not based on the evidence on record or

that evidence was overlooked. Appreciation of evidence was also

proper and at any rate is not pervere. The finding of fact by the

first appellate court being the last court of facts cannot be

interfered. I do not find any substantial question of law involved

in the appeal.
