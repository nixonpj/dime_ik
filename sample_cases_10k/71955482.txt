<pre id="pre_1">     THE HON'BLE SMT JUSTICE KONGARA VIJAYA LAKSHMI

 Writ Petition Nos.18021 of 2009, 23742 of 2009, 14997 of 2010
                       and 26086 of 2010

Common Order:

      Since the issue involved in all these four Writ Petitions is common

in nature, they are being disposed of by this common order.

      The case of the petitioner, in brief, is that pursuant to the tender

notice issued by the respondent Corporation in December 2008 the

petitioner was awarded the contract for collection of trade licence fees in

Warangal Municipal Corporation on payment of a sum of Rs.1.19 Crores

for a period of two years and an agreement dated 21.01.2009 was

entered between the petitioner and the respondent Corporation and the

petitioner paid an amount of Rs.42,87,500/- which included earnest

money deposit advance amount deposited at the time of submitting the

tenders; as per Clause 13 of the agreement the petitioner is entitled to

adjust the amounts, if any, collected by the respondent through its e-seva

centres for the financial year 2008-2009; and the respondent collected the

trade licence fee directly from E-Seva centres for the period from

01.04.2008 to 21.01.2009 i.e., more than nine (9) months; the amount

collected by the respondent for the said period has not been accounted to

the petitioner; on 30.06.2009 the respondent issued a show cause notice

calling upon the petitioner to show cause as to why the tender should not

be cancelled for deviation of tender conditions and the petitioner

submitted a reply to the said show cause notice; subsequently, the

respondent   issued   proceedings    dated   18.08.2009    cancelling   the

agreement dated 21.01.2009 and directing the petitioner to pay the dues

immediately; challenging the said proceedings the petitioner filed

W.P.No.18021 of 2009; pending the said Writ Petition when the
                                         2




respondent issued orders dated 28.10.2009 demanding a sum of

Rs.42,62,950/-, the petitioner filed W.P.No.23742 of 2009 and pursuant to

the interim orders passed by this Court in the said Writ Petition the

petitioner deposited a sum of Rs.20,00,000/-; while so, the respondent

Corporation unilaterally sealed the shop under proceedings dated

12.05.2010 and the same was challenged in W.P.No.14997 of 2010; this

Court by order dated 21.07.2010 directed the respondent to release the

business premises of the petitioner and the said order is still subsisting;

again the respondent issued the impugned notice dated 12.10.2010

directing the petitioner to pay the due amount of Rs.22,62,950/- and

aggrieved by the same, the petitioner filed WP No.26086 of 2010; the

grievance of the petitioner is that since the respondent did not come

forward to disclose the trade licence fee collected by it for the period from

01.04.2008 to 21.01.2009 the petitioner is under no obligation to pay the

alleged balance amount.

         Counter affidavit has been filed by the respondent Corporation

stating, inter alia, that the Corporation has calculated the trade licence fee

collected through E-Seva centers which comes to Rs.18,99,500/- and

calculated the amount payable by the petitioner till cancellation of the

tender agreement, duly deducting the amount already paid by the

petitioner and also the amount collected by the Corporation through E-

Seva centers and finally the due amount payable by the petitioner comes

to Rs.42,62,950/- and, accordingly, the order dated 28.10.2009 was

issued   directing   the   petitioner   to   pay   the   balance   amount   of

Rs.42,62,950/-; against the said order the petitioner filed W.P.No.23742

of 2009 and this Court, by order dated 04.11.2009, granted interim stay

on condition of the petitioner depositing a sum of Rs.20,00,000/-. After

deduction of the amount of Rs.20,00,000/- paid by the petitioner as per
                                       3




the orders of this Court in WP No.23742 of 2009 and Rs.5,00,000/- as per

the orders of this Court in WP No.26086 of 2010, still an amount of

Rs.17,62,950/- is due to be payable by the petitioner to the respondent

Corporation.

       When the matter came up for hearing, learned counsel for the

respondent passed on a calculation memo with regard to the amounts

payable by the petitioner towards trade licence fees. According to the

said calculation memo issued by the Municipal Health Officer, Greater

Warangal Municipal Corporation, the total amount due from the petitioner

is Rs.17,62,550/-.

       Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that he would file a

detailed representation to the respondent giving details with regard to the

amounts collected and paid to the Corporation.

       In that view of the matter, the Writ Petitions are disposed of

directing the petitioner to file a detailed representation to the respondent

giving details with regard to the amounts collected and paid to the

Corporation within a period of two weeks from the date of receipt of a

copy of this order and on receipt of such representation from the

petitioner the respondent shall consider the same and pass appropriate

orders thereon and take necessary action in accordance with law. There

shall be no order as to costs.

       As a sequel thereto, the miscellaneous petitions, if any, pending in

these Writ Petitions shall stand closed.
