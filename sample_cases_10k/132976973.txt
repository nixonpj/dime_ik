ORAL ORDER</pre>
 


 


 
	  

<p id="p_1">This
	application is filed by the applicant under <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_1">Section 438</a> of the Code
	of Criminal Procedure for anticipatory bail in connection with FIR
	registered being C.R.No.I-46/2013 registered at Padra Police
	Station, Dist. Vadodara for the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/965532/" id="a_2">Sections
	418</a>, <a href="/doc/1099980/" id="a_3">420</a>, <a href="/doc/338903/" id="a_4">465</a>, <a href="/doc/286506/" id="a_5">467</a>, <a href="/doc/1590825/" id="a_6">471</a>, <a href="/doc/414294/" id="a_7">192</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_8">120B</a>, etc. of<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9"> the Indian Penal Code</a>.
</p>	  


<p id="p_2">	Learned advocate
	for the applicant submits that the complaint is nothing but a
	short-cut adopted by the complainant by setting the criminal
	machinery in motion and though for enforcement of agreement to sell
	no  notice was given and no civil remedy is taken and the applicant
	had already issued public notice for cancellation of earlier power
	of attorney and Banakath.  It is further submitted that, later on,
	another sale transaction had taken place for which remedy is
	available to the complainant.  It is further submitted that the
	applicant has roots in the society, will not flee from justice and
	will cooperate with the investigation as and when called for. It is
	further submitted that in view of the above, the applicant may be
	granted anticipatory bail.  
</p>	
	  


<p id="p_3">	Heard Learned APP
	for the respondent   State.
</p>	  


<p id="p_4">	Having heard
	learned counsel for the parties and perusing the record of the case
	and taking into consideration the facts of the case, as narrated
	above, nature of allegations, role attributed to the accused and
	punishment prescribed for the alleged offences,
	without discussing the evidence in detail, at this stage, I am
	inclined to grant anticipatory bail to the applicant.    This Court
	has also taken into consideration the law laid down by the Apex
	Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1108032/" id="a_10">Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre v. State of
	Maharashtra &amp; Ors. Reported</a> in [2011]1 SCC 694, wherein
	the Apex Court reiterated the law laid down by the Constitutional
	Bench in the case of Shri Gurubaksh Singh Sibbia &amp; Ors.
	Reported in [1980]2 SCC 565.
</p>	  


<p id="p_5">	Learned counsel
	for the parties do not press for further reasoned order.
</p>	  


<p id="p_6">	In the result,
	this application is allowed by directing that in the event of the
	applicant herein being arrested pursuant to FIR being
	C.R.No.I-46/2013 registered at Padra Police
	Station, Vadodara the applicant shall be released on bail on
	furnishing a bond of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) with one
	surety of like amount on following conditions :-
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_7">[a]	shall
cooperate with the investigation and make himself 	available 	for
	interrogation whenever required. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_8">[b]	shall remain
present at concerned Police Station on  16.04..2013 between 11:00 am
to 2:00 pm:
</p> 


<p id="p_9">[c]	shall not
hamper the investigation in any manner nor shall directly or
indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any witness so
as to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any
Police Officer;
</p> 


<p id="p_10">[d]	shall at the
time of execution of bond, furnish the address to the Investigating
Officer and the Court concerned and shall not change the residence
till the final disposal of the case or till further orders;
</p> 


<p id="p_11">[e] 	will not
leave India without the permission of the Court and, if is holding a
Passport, shall surrender the same before the trial Court
immediately;
</p> 


<p id="p_12">[f]	It would be
open to the Investigating Officer to file an application for remand,
if he considers it just and proper and the concerned Magistrate would
decide it on merits;	
</p> 


<p id="p_13">[g]	despite this
order, it would be open for the Investigating Agency to apply to the
competent Magistrate, for police remand of the applicant. The
applicant shall remain present before the learned Magistrate on the
first date of hearing of such application and on all subsequent
occasions, as may be directed by the learned Magistrate. This would
be sufficient to treat the accused in the judicial custody for the
purpose of entertaining application of the prosecution for police
remand. This is, however, without prejudice to the right of the
accused to seek stay against an order of remand, if ultimately
granted, and the power of the learned Magistrate to consider such a
request in accordance with law. It is clarified that the applicant,
even if, remanded to the police custody, upon completion of such
period of police remand, shall be set free immediately, subject to
other conditions of this anticipatory bail order.
</p> 


 


 
	 


<p id="p_14">	At the trial, the
	trial court shall not be influenced by the prima facie observations
	made by this Court while enlarging the applicant on bail.
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_15">	Rule made
absolute. Application is disposed of accordingly.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_16">	Direct service is
permitted.
