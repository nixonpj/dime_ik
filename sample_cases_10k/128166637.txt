                               Re : A.S.T.A. 197 of 2014

              The appellant-petitioner herein being aggrieved

           by the impugned award passed by the learned Tribunal

           filed a writ petition before this court which was

           partly    allowed    by     the   learned       Single    Judge      upon

           holding that the award passed by the said learned

           Tribunal should be treated as 'no award'.

              There      is     no     dispute       that     the     appellant-

           petitioner    herein       prayed      for   adjournment        of   the

           hearing repeatedly before the learned Tribunal as a

           result    whereof,        the   hearing      of    the    matter     was

           considerably delayed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">              The learned Tribunal had the discretion not to

           grant    repeated    adjournments         but     the    said   learned

           Tribunal without deciding the claim of the workman

           concerned namely, the appellant-petitioner herein in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       2</span>



an appropriate manner cannot arrive at a conclusion

that such claim is completely unmeritorious.

</p><p id="p_3">      On examination of the impugned award passed by

the   learned     Tribunal,         we     find    that    the     validity

and/or    legality           of    the     claim     of     the    workman

concerned was never adjudicated and/or decided by

the    said    learned        Tribunal      on     the    basis     of   the

available       records       although       the    learned        Tribunal

arrived   at     the    conclusion         that    the     claim    of   the

workman has no merit.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      Therefore,       the    aforesaid       award       passed    by   the

learned       Judge,    9th       Industrial       Tribunal,       Durgapur

cannot be sustained in the eye of law specially when

we find that the said learned Judge arrived at the

conclusion that the claim of the workman concerned

has no merit even without assigning any reason and

in absence of any material.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      The learned Single Judge, in our opinion, should

not have modified the award by treating the said

award    as    'no     award'      when    fact     remains       that   the

learned Judge of the Tribunal concerned specifically

passed the award in absence of proper materials and

without any valid reason.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      In the aforesaid circumstances, we set aside the

impugned award passed by the learned Tribunal and

direct the said learned Tribunal to decide the merit

of the claim of the workman concerned namely, the

appellant-petitioner              herein    on     the    basis     of   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 3</span>



available     records    without      any   further       delay   and

preferably within a period of eight weeks from the

date   of   communication      of   this    order     upon   giving

reasonable opportunity of hearing to the respective

parties and also allowing both the parties to adduce

evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_7">   Needless to mention that the parties herein will

not pray for adjournment of the hearing before the

learned     Tribunal    on   flimsy    grounds      and    the    said

learned Tribunal will have the discretion to reject

any prayer for adjournment on proper grounds.

   With the aforesaid observations and directions,

we set aside the impugned order under appeal passed

by the learned Single Judge and dispose of both the

application as well as the appeal upon treating the

said appeal as on day's list.
</p>
<p id="p_8">   In the facts of the present case, there will be

no order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_9">   Let urgent xerox certified copy of this order,

if applied for, be given to the learned Advocate of

the parties on usual undertaking.
