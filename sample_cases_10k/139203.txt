<p id="p_1">      The petitioner, who is now working as Village Officer at

Maruthomkara Village in Vadakara Taluk, Kozhikode district,

seeks to quash Annexure A2 FIR in V.C.No.13/2009/TCR

registered by the 3rd respondent, Deputy Superintendent of

Police, VACB, Thrissur and all further proceedings.

</p><p id="p_2">      2.  It appears that the one Ramakrishanan (the 4th

respondent herein) had persistently filing complaints of

corruption and criminal misconduct against the petitioner herein

before the Enquiry Commissioner and Special Judge, Thrissur

and notwithstanding Annexure A1 report dated 16.1.2008

submitted by the 3rd respondent to the effect that the allegations

levelled against the petitioner were false, Annexure A2 FIR was

registered against the petitioner. The 4th respondent had again

moved the Enquiry Commissioner and Special Judge, Thrissur

resulting in a 2nd enquiry by the 3rd respondent resulting in

Annexure A4 report. Even though both Annexure A1 and A4

reports go to show that the petitioner in her capacity as Village

Officer had submitted a correct report, after proper enquiry in

the matter, the grievance of the petitioner is that she was being

vexed and harassed at the instance of the 4th respondent.

</p><p id="p_3">       3. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that a report

has been filed on 28.05.2010 before the Enquiry Commissioner

and Special Judge, Thrissur to the effect that the allegations

levelled against the petitioner were false and prosecution under

<a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_1">Section 211</a> IPC has been recommended against the 4th

respondent         for    initiating  false and malevolent  criminal

proceedings against the petitioner.           The said submission is

recorded. Annexure A2 FIRis quashed.
