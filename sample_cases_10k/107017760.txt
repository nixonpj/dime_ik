             as Teacher (L.B.), Govt. Middle School, Jhartarai, Block Bastar, District
             Jagdalpur (C.G.).

09/10/2018
</pre><p id="p_2">      1.     The limited prayer which the petitioner has sought in this writ petition is

      for a direction to respondent no.1 to take a decision on the claim of the

      petitioners for grant of two advance increments on his/her obtaining

      B.Ed./D.Ed. certificate both prior to appointment as well as subsequent to

      the appointment which is being otherwise provided to the Govt. teachers.


</p><p id="p_3">      2.     The claim of the petitioner is based on the fact that the nature of duties

      discharged by him as Shiksha Karmis is identical and similar to the

      government teachers and his/her services has also now got merged with the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2</span>

  Education Department. Therefore, the benefits which are being extended to

  the government teachers should also be extended to the petitioner. The

  petitioner in this regard has made representations to the respondents which

  are collectively marked in the petition as Annexure P-4.


</p><p id="p_4">  3.    Given the nature of dispute and also the fact that the claim of the

  petitioner would require a policy decision on the part of the State Govt., this

  court does not intend to keep the petition pending any further, rather ends of

  justice would meet if the petition is disposed of with a direction to

  respondents 1 &amp; 2 to take a decision in this regard as to whether the

  petitioner would also be entitled for similar benefits as are being granted to

  the regular government teachers. It is ordered accordingly. Let this exercise

  be concluded within a period of 4 months from the date of receipt of certified

  copy of this order. It shall be the responsibility of the petitioner to bring the

  order of this Court to the notice of respondents 1 &amp; 2 along with any fresh

  representation, if they so prefer.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">  4.    It is made clear that this Court has not expressed anything on merits of

  the case so far as the entitlement of the petitioner is concerned. The

  Respondents shall be at liberty to take a decision independently.
