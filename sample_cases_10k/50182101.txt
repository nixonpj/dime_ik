                                 C.P.A.N. 1290 of 2009
     9.9.10
     .md.                              In
                                 W.P. 762 (W) of 2007

              Mr. Satyajit Mandal
              Mr. Sanjib Dutta
                           ... for the petitioners

              Mr. Sumit Kr. Panja
              Mr. Sumit Ray
                           ... for the alleged contemnors

                   The grievance of the petitioners herein is that the
              order dated March 17, 2009 has not been complied with.
              The order dated March 17, 2009 was passed at the final
              hearing of W.P. No. 762 (W) of 2007 and by such order the
              writ petition was disposed of.


                   The case run in the writ petition was that the
              respondent-licensee had carried an electric line above the</pre>
<p id="p_1">              petitioners'   building   which   seriously   impaired       the
              possibility of the petitioners making further construction.
              At the time that the matter was taken up for final hearing,
              it was pointed out on behalf of the respondents to the writ
              petition that the line had been taken in such manner
              following an order passed in proceedings under Section
              144 (2)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1"> of the Criminal Procedure Code</a>. The order dated
              March 17, 2009 observed that since the order passed in
              the <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_2">section 144</a> proceedings had not been mentioned, the
              effect of the order made in the <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_3">Section 144</a> proceedings
              could not be undone by way of the writ petition. The order
              permitted the petitioners to make a request to the licensee
              and for the licensee to consider whether an alternative
              route could be arranged for carrying the electricity line.
</p>

<p id="p_2">                    The present complaint in the contempt petition is
              that the licensee took an arbitrary decision without taking
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      2</span>




into account relevant factors. The petitioners insist that an
alternative route is possible.
</p>

<p id="p_3">        It   is   the   admitted   position   that   the   alleged
contemnors considered the matter after the order dated
March 17, 2009 was passed and took a decision whether
the line was to be re-routed. The decision may have been
bad or even perverse, but that would not imply that the
alleged contemnors had deliberately or wilfully violated the
order dated March 17, 2009. The present grievance of the
petitioners may be amenable in some other jurisdiction,
but once it is seen that the alleged contemnors had acted
upon the order dated March 17, 2009 and had expressed
the opinion, which they were left free to do by the order,
that there was no possible alternative route, it cannot be
said that the alleged contemnors had acted in derogation
of the order of had deliberately or wilfully disobeyed the
same.
</p>

<p id="p_4">        C.P.A.N. 1290 of 2009 is dismissed.
</p><p id="p_5">        There will be no order as to costs.
</p>

<p id="p_6">        This order will not preclude the petitioners from
pursuing their grievance in the appropriate forum.
</p>

<p id="p_7">        Urgent certified photocopies of this order, if applied
for, be given to the parties subject to compliance with all
requisite formalities.
</p>
