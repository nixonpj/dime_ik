 emanating therefrom against them.
</p>
<p id="p_4">2.    Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submit that
the aforesaid case was registered on the complaint of respondent No.2,
namely, Ms.Renu, consequent upon certain matrimonial and domestic
disputes having arisen between the parties. The case is at the initial stage
of trial as charges have been framed against petitioners by learned Trial
Court. Meanwhile, the respondent No.2 and the petitioners have amicably
settled their disputes before Delhi Mediation Centre, Dwarka Courts,
Delhi vide settlement/agreement dated 09.05.2014, for a total sum of
Rs.05.50 Lac. As per the said settlement, two instalments of Rs.02.00 Lac
each were paid at the time of recording first motion petition and second
motion petition for divorce by mutual consent and the balance amount of
Rs.1.50 Lac is paid today in the Court through draft bearing No.547850
dated 04.11.2015 drawn on State Bank of India in favour of respondent
No.2, which facts have not been disputed by the respondent No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.    Learned counsel for the petitioners further submits that consequent
to the said settlement, marriage between the petitioner No.1 and
respondent No.2 has been dissolved vide decree of mutual divorce dated
11.09.2015 under <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_5">Section 13</a> B (2) of the <a href="/doc/590166/" id="a_6">Hindu Marriage Act</a>, 1955.
Thus, respondent No.2 does not wish to pursue her case further against the
petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.    Respondent No.2 is personally present in the Court with her father
and through her counsel named above and she has been duly identified by
the Investigating Officer of the case.       The learned counsel under
instructions does not dispute the submissions made by learned counsel for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">       Crl.M.C. No.4725/2015                               Page 2 of 8</span>
 the petitioners and submits that the present matter has been amicably
settled, marriage between the respondent No.2 and the petitioner No.1 has
been dissolved vide decree of divorce dated 11.09.2015, she has received
the entire agreed amount and has no complaints whatsoever against the
petitioner No.1 and his family members. Respondent No.2 states that now
no dispute with petitioners survives and so, the proceedings arising out of
the FIR in question may be brought to an end.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.    Learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing on behalf of the
State submits that the case is at the trial stage. He submits that the present
matter is a matrimonial one and since the respondent No.2 does not wish
to pursue the case further against petitioners, no purpose would be served
if the petitioners are directed to face trial. Therefore, the State has no
objection, if the present petition is allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.    Under the circumstances and looking to the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab and
Another (2012) 10 SCC 303, wherein the Apex Court has referred to a
number of matters for the proposition that even a non-compoundable
offence can also be quashed on the ground of a settlement agreement
between the offender and the victim, if the circumstances so warrant; by
observing as under:
</p><p id="p_9">           "58.     ....However,     certain     offences   which
          overwhelmingly and predominantly bear civil flavour
          having arisen out of civil, mercantile, commercial,
          financial, partnership or such like transactions or the
          offences arising out of matrimony, particularly relating
          to dowry, etc. or the family dispute, where the wrong is
          basically to the victim and the offender and the victim
          have settled all disputes between them amicably,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">       Crl.M.C. No.4725/2015                                 Page 3 of 8</span>
          irrespective of the fact that such offences have not been
         made compoundable, the High Court may within the
         framework of its inherent power, quash the criminal
         proceeding or criminal complaint or FIR if it is satisfied
         that on the face of such settlement, there is hardly any
         likelihood of the offender being convicted and by not
         quashing the criminal proceedings, justice shall be
         casualty and ends of justice shall be defeated."
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.    While recognizing the need of amicable resolution of disputes in
cases like the instant one, the aforesaid dictum has been affirmed by the
Apex Court in a recent judgment in Narinder Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. State of
Punjab &amp; Anr. 2014 6 SCC 466. The pertinent observations of the Apex
Court are as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">         29. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we sum up and
         lay down the following principles by which the High
         Court would be guided in giving adequate treatment to
         the settlement between the parties and exercising its
         power under Section 482 of the Code while accepting the
         settlement and quashing the proceedings or refusing to
         accept the settlement with direction to continue with the
         criminal proceedings:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">          29.1 Power conferred under Section 482 of the Code is
         to be distinguished from the power which lies in the
         Court to compound the offences under Section 320 of the
         Code. No doubt, under Section 482 of the Code, the High
         Court has inherent power to quash the criminal
         proceedings even in those cases which are not
         compoundable, where the parties have settled the matter
         between themselves. However, this power is to be
         exercised sparingly and with caution.
         29.2. When the parties have reached the settlement and
         on that basis petition for quashing the criminal
         proceedings is filed, the guiding factor in such cases
         would be to secure:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">         (i) ends of justice, or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">         (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court.
</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">      Crl.M.C. No.4725/2015                               Page 4 of 8</span>
<p id="p_11">   While exercising the power the High Court is to form an
  opinion on either of the aforesaid two objectives.
  29.3. Such a power is not to be exercised in those
  prosecutions which involve heinous and serious offences
  of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
  dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in nature and
  have a serious impact on society. Similarly, for the
  offences alleged to have been committed under special
  statute like the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_7">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> or the
  offences committed by public servants while working in
  that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis
  of compromise between the victim and the offender.
  29.4. On the other hand, those criminal cases having
  overwhelmingly and predominantly civil character,
  particularly those arising out of commercial transactions
  or arising out of matrimonial relationship or family
  disputes should be quashed when the parties have
  resolved their entire disputes among themselves.
  29.5. While exercising its powers, the High Court is to
  examine as to whether the possibility of conviction is
  remote and bleak and continuation of criminal cases
  would put the accused to great oppression and prejudice
  and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not
  quashing the criminal cases.
</p><p id="p_12">  29.6. Offences under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_8">Section 307</a> IPC would fall in the
  category of heinous and serious offences and therefore
  are to be generally treated as crime against the society
  and not against the individual alone. However, the High
  Court would not rest its decision merely because there is
  a mention of <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_9">Section 307</a> IPC in the FIR or the charge is
  framed under this provision. It would be open to the
  High Court to examine as to whether incorporation of
  <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_10">Section 307</a> IPC is there for the sake of it or the
  prosecution has collected sufficient evidence, which if
  proved, would lead to proving the charge under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_11">Section
  307</a> IPC. For this purpose, it would be open to the High
  Court to go by the nature of injury sustained, whether
  such injury is inflicted on the vital/delegate parts of the
  body, nature of weapons used, etc. Medical report in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">Crl.M.C. No.4725/2015                               Page 5 of 8</span>
   respect of injuries suffered by the victim can generally be
  the guiding factor. On the basis of this prima facie
  analysis, the High Court can examine as to whether
  there is a strong possibility of conviction or the chances
  of conviction are remote and bleak. In the former case it
  can refuse to accept the settlement and quash the
  criminal proceedings whereas in the latter case it would
  be permissible for the High Court to accept the plea
  compounding the offence based on complete settlement
  between the parties. At this stage, the Court can also be
  swayed by the fact that the settlement between the parties
  is going to result in harmony between them which may
  improve their future relationship.
</p><p id="p_13">  29.7. While deciding whether to exercise its power under
  <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_12">Section 482</a> of the Code or not, timings of settlement play
  a crucial role. Those cases where the settlement is
  arrived at immediately after the alleged commission of
  offence and the matter is still under investigation, the
  High Court may be liberal in accepting the settlement to
  quash the criminal proceedings/investigation. It is
  because of the reason that at this stage the investigation
  is still on and even the charge-sheet has not been filed.
  Likewise, those cases where the charge is framed but the
  evidence is yet to start or the evidence is still at infancy
  stage, the High Court can show benevolence in
  exercising its powers favourably, but after prima facie
  assessment of the circumstances/material mentioned
  above. On the other hand, where the prosecution
  evidence is almost complete or after the conclusion of the
  evidence the matter is at the stage of argument, normally
  the High Court should refrain from exercising its power
  under <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_13">Section 482</a> of the Code, as in such cases the trial
  court would be in a position to decide the case finally on
  merits and to come to a conclusion as to whether the
  offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_14">Section 307</a> IPC is committed or not.
  Similarly, in those cases where the conviction is already
  recorded by the trial court and the matter is at the
  appellate stage before the High Court, mere compromise
  between the parties would not be a ground to accept the
  same resulting in acquittal of the offender who has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">Crl.M.C. No.4725/2015                               Page 6 of 8</span>
          already been convicted by the trial court. Here charge is
         proved under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_15">Section 307</a> IPC and conviction is already
         recorded of a heinous crime and, therefore, there is no
         question of sparing a convict found guilty of such a
         crime."
</p>
<p id="p_14">8.    In the case of Jitendra Raghuvanshi &amp; Ors. Vs. Babita
Raghuvanshi &amp; Anr. (2013) 4 SCC 58, wherein the Supreme Court in
respect of the matrimonial disputes has specifically held as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">           "15. In our view, it is the duty of the courts to
           encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes,
           particularly, when the same are on considerable
           increase. Even if the offences are non-compoundable, if
           they relate to matrimonial disputes and the Court is
           satisfied that the parties have settled the same amicably
           and without any pressure, we hold that for the purpose
           of securing ends of justice, Section 320 of the Code
           would not be a bar to the exercise of power of quashing
           of FIR, complaint or the subsequent criminal
           proceedings.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">           16. There has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes
           in recent times. They institution of marriage occupies
           an important place and it has an important role to play
           in the society. Therefore, every effort should be made in
           the interest of the individuals in order to enable them to
           settle down in life and live peacefully. If the parties
           ponder over their defaults and terminate their disputes
           amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out
           in a court of law, in order to do complete justice in the
           matrimonial matters, the courts should be less hesitant
           in exercising their extraordinary jurisdiction. It is trite
           to state that the power under Section 482 should be
           exercised sparingly and with circumspection only when
           the Court is convinced, on the basis of material on
           record, that allowing the proceedings to continue
           would be an abuse of process of court or that the ends
           of justice require that the proceedings ought to be
           quashed...."

<p id="p_15"> 9.     Both the parties who are present in the Court today, approbate the
aforesaid settlement dated 09.05.2014 and undertake to remain bound by
the same.
</p>
<p id="p_16">10.    Since the subject matter of this FIR is essentially matrimonial,
which now stands mutually and amicably settled between the parties and
the complainant is no longer interested in supporting the prosecution
because of which, its chances of success in the matter are now greatly
diminished. Therefore, in view of the law discussed above, in the facts
and circumstances as noted above, I am of the considered opinion that this
matter deserves to be given a quietus as continuance of proceedings
arising out of the FIR in question would be an exercise in futility.
