</pre>


<p id="p_1">          This appeal by the State challenges the acquittal

of the accused for the offences punishable under Section

511 of Section 376(2) (f) and 506(ii)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1"> of Indian Penal Code</a>.

</p><p id="p_2">          2. P.W.2 is the victim in this case and P.Ws.1 and

3 are her parents. The incident is said to have taken place

on 12.4.1997 at about 12'o clock in the noon. On that day,

as usual the father of the victim had gone for work. The

mother, who runs a petty shop, had gone to purchase

articles for the shop.         The allegation is that during that

period the accused invited the little girl to watch TV in his

house and the girl went there. No sooner than she entered

into the house, she was made to lie on a cot and she was

brutally ravished. The further allegation is that hearing the

cry of the child, P.W.3 came from the shop and ascertained

the reason and she was told that the child had been sexually

assaulted. The victim was taken to the hospital and the

doctor there examined her. She was admitted for a day in

the hospital and on the next day she was discharged from

the hospital. P.W.1 on 14.4.1997 at 8.30 p.m. laid Ext.P1

first information statement before the Kalamassery Police

Station. P.W.1, the Sub Inspector of Police, recorded Ext.P1

FIS and registered crime as per Ext.P1(a) FIR. P.W.15 took

over investigation. He had Ext.P4 scene mahazar prepared

and had M.O.3 bed sheet seized from the place of

occurrence. He had M.Os. 1 and 2, the dresses alleged to

have been worn by the victim at the relevant time seized as

per Ext.P5. As per Ext.P6(a) confession statement made by

the accused on questioning him, P.W.15 seized M.O.4 knife

as per Ext.P6 mahazar. He had Ext.P2 document obtained

from the Medical Centre Hospital, Palarivattom where the

victim was admitted and had undergone treatment for a

day. He then had the victim examined at the Government

Hospital, Ernakulam and obtained Ext.P10 certificate. After

the arrest of the accused, he had him subjected to potency

test and obtained Ext.P9 certificate.         He recorded the

statements of witness and found that no offence under

<a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_2">Section 376</a> had been made out during investigation and

only offence under Section 511 of Section 376 was made

out. Therefore, he filed a report before the court concerned

seeking to have the offences altered to one under Section

511 of Section 376 and 506(ii) <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">I.P.C</a>. After investigation he

laid final charge before court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">              3. JFCM-II, Aluva, before whom final charge was

laid took cognizance of the offences.          Finding that the

offence is one exclusively triable by a court of Sessions, the

said court committed the case to Sessions Court, Ernakulam

under <a href="/doc/887219/" id="a_4">Section 209</a> Cr.P.C. The said court made over the

case to Assistant Sessions Court, North Paravur for trial and

disposal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">              4. The latter court, on receipt of records and on

appearance of accused, framed charge for the offences

under sections 511 of Section 376(2)(f) and Section 506(ii)

Crl.Appeal. 106/2005.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 4</span><p id="p_7">

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">I.P.C</a>. To the charge, the accused pleaded not guilty and

claimed to be tried. The prosecution therefore had P.Ws.1

to 15 examined and Exts.P1 to P11 marked. M.Os. 1 to 4

were identified and marked. After the close of the

prosecution evidence, the accused was questioned under

<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_6">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C.         He denied all the incriminating

circumstances brought out against him and maintained that

he is innocent.       Finding that the accused could not be

acquitted under <a href="/doc/19163/" id="a_7">Section 232</a> Cr.P.C., he was asked to enter

on his defence. He chose to adduce no evidence.

</p><p id="p_8">              5. On an appreciation of the evidence in the case,

the trial court found that the the evidence of P.W.2, the

victim in this case, could not be safely accepted. According

to the lower court, the child witness appeared to be a

tutored witness and there was no supporting evidence to

corroborate the version given by P.W.2. The court below

found that there was a reasonable doubt regarding the case

put forward by the prosecution and extended the benefit of

Crl.Appeal. 106/2005.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                5</span><p id="p_9">

doubt to the accused and acquitted him of all charges

levelled against him.
</p>
<p id="p_10">              6.     Learned Public Prosecutor assailing the

acquittal pointed out that the court below was not justified in

acquitting the accused.      May be that the offence alleged

have not been made out. But a lesser offence has been

made out. There was no justification for the lower court to

come to the conclusion that P.W.2 was a tutored witness.

None of the reasons given by the lower court is justified.

Evidence of        P.W. 1 and 3, the parents of the victim is

sufficiently corroborated by the evidence of P.W.4 who had

seen the child immediately after the incident and who had

occasion to wash the child and these aspects have been

omitted to be noticed by the court below. Emphasis was laid

on the fact that M.O.3 bed sheet seized at the time of

preparation of scene mahazar and M.Os. 1         and 2, the

clothes said to have been worn by the victim were handed

over for examination and Exts. P4 and P5 mahazars showed

Crl.Appeal. 106/2005.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                6</span><p id="p_11">

blood stains which corroborated the evidence of          P.W.2.

These vital pieces of evidence have been been omitted to be

noticed by the court below. It is also pointed out that the

accused is a close neighbour of the victim and no reason

whatsoever is put forward to show that P.Ws.1 to 3 had any

reason to falsely implicate him. Merely because the medical

evidence may not be in support of the prosecution, it is not a

ground to reject the evidence of P.W.2, the child witness

who has given a cogent and convincing version regarding

the incident.
</p>
<p id="p_12">              7. Learned Public Prosecutor invited the attention

of this court to paragraph 13 of the judgment of the court

below and pointed out that the principle of law mentioned

therein cannot be accepted. By no stretch of imagination,

the victim of rape can be considered as an accomplice. It

was on that basis that evidence was evaluated and therefore

it is pointed out that the findings are totally unacceptable

both in law and on facts.       At any rate, according to the

Crl.Appeal. 106/2005.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                7</span><p id="p_13">

learned Public Prosecutor, going by Ext.P10 and the

evidence of P.W.15, offence under <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_8">Section           354</a> I.P.C. is

clearly made out.
</p>
<p id="p_14">              8. Learned counsel appearing for the accused on

the other hand reminded this court that this court is sitting

in appeal against an order of acquittal and the principles of

appreciating the evidence      are well laid down in various

decisions of the Apex Court. The court below which had the

occasion to watch the demeanor of witnesses has chosen to

disbelieve them and unless it is shown that the findings are

perverse or erroneous, merely because another view is

possible, this court will not be justified in interfering with the

order of acquittal.
</p>
<p id="p_15">              9. Learned counsel then went on to point out that

even if the prosecution had a case           that there was no

attempt to commit rape, the evidence was adduced in such

a manner that actual rape had infact been committed and

the evidence of P.W.2 gives a graphic description of the

Crl.Appeal. 106/2005.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                8</span><p id="p_16">

incident which would reveal that the prosecution was trying

to establish the offence under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_9">Section 376</a> I.P.C. It was

these factors which had persuaded the court below to come

to the conclusion that P.W.2, the child witness, could have

been a tutored witness. Learned counsel also pointed out

that there was no quarrel with the proposition that if the

evidence of prosecutrix is cogent, convincing and of a

sterling character, that can form the basis of conviction. But

in the case on hand, the evidence of the prosecutrix is belied

by the other evidence in the case, therefore the principle

cannot apply.        The medical and forensic evidence in this

case clearly belie the version given by the prosecutrix.

There is nothing to show that the victim had suffered any

injury as claimed by P.W.1 to 3 or there was profuse

bleeding as claimed by them and in fact these claims made

by P.Ws.1 to 3 are belied by the medical evidence. As far as

the entry in Ext.P10 is concerned, learned counsel pointed

out that that entry was not specifically put to the accused

Crl.Appeal. 106/2005.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                9</span><p id="p_17">

and that version said to have been given by P.W.2 was not

put to that witness to ascertain why she had given such a

version to the doctor concerned. In the absence of any such

evidence, that entry cannot be relied on to come to the

conclusion that offence under <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_10">Section 354</a> I.P.C. is made out.

</p><p id="p_18">              10. Learned counsel also pointed out that a close

scrutiny of the evidence will show that there was an attempt

to make embellishments and developments at each stage

and that makes the prosecution evidence extremely

vulnerable especially when the medical evidence and the

forensic evidence are against the prosecution.          There is

nothing to show that the view taken by the court below is

contrary to the evidence on record or is so perverse that it

calls for interference. At any rate, it is a possible view and if

that be so, interference with the acquittal is not warranted.

</p><p id="p_19">              11. P.W.2 is the victim in this case. The victim

was aged only 7 years at the relevant time. P.W.1 is the

father of the victim and P.W.3 is her mother. The evidence

Crl.Appeal. 106/2005.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                             10</span><p id="p_20">

regarding the offence is furnished by P.W.2 with the

supporting evidence of P.Ws.1, 3 and 4.      P.W.2 gives a

graphic description of what transpired on the relevant date.

She would say that her father had gone for work and her

mother had gone out to purchase articles for the shop. She

would say that she was called to the house of the accused to

watch TV. She went there and the accused made her to lie

on a cot and ravished her. At the time of evidence, she

would say that she was frightened with a knife so as not to

reveal the incident to anybody and she would say that there

was profuse bleeding from her private part. She would also

say that she washed herself thereafter.    The evidence of

P.W.4 is to the effect that she happened to see the child

washing herself and she went to the aid of the child.

Surprisingly enough, no question was put to P.W.4 as to

what she had seen or what had been washed off from the

body of the child. The only statement made by P.W.4 is that

she helped the child in washing herself. She does not speak

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                  11</span><p id="p_21">

of having seen blood or anything else in the body of the

child.
</p>
<p id="p_22">              12. The evidence of P.W.1 is to the effect that he

was called from his work place by his wife by giving

information about the mishap that had fallen on the child.

When he came home, he was told about the incident and he

had taken the child to the hospital. P.W.3 would say that

when she reached home, she came across a few ladies in

the nearby houses and they say that something had

happened to the child. P.W.3 would say that she had found

that there was bleeding from the private parts of the child.

P.W.3 then says that she had seen scratch marks on the

chest and private parts of the child.
</p>
<p id="p_23">              13. It is true that Ext.P4 scene mahazar prepared

by P.W.15 during which the bed sheet was seized, it is stated

in the said document that blood stains were found on the

bed sheet. Ext.P5 is the mahazar by which M.Os.1 and 3

investigating officer by the father of the victim.

Ernakulam Medical Centre where the child was initially taken

for treatment. The entry shows that the child was brought

to the hospital with history of previous bleeding. But the

doctor who first examined her had stated that he did not find

any signs of bleeding and it was also noticed in the medical

records that the child was not willing for a local examination

and the parents were also not willing to have the child

locally examined.         The child was later examined by a

Pediatrician and a Gynecologist.       Both of them could not

notice any bleeding or injury on the body of the child or on

her private parts.

P.W.15, he had the child examined by Dr. Sulekha, who

issued Ext.P10 certificate.        Ext.P10 certificate however

makes mention of a scratch mark in the private part.

of spermatozoa on items Nos.1 to 3 and does not say

anything about the blood stains which the investigating

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">              "The evidence of a child witness has to be

      only if the court comes to the conclusion that the

      is capable of giving rational answers (see <a href="/doc/371095/" id="a_12">Section

      118</a> of the Evidence Act).      A child witness, by

      reason of his tender age, is a pliable witness. He

      can be tutored easily either by threat, coercion or

      inducement.        Therefore, the court must be

      satisfied that the attendant circumstances do not

      truth.       It is safe and prudent to look for

      imagination and exaggerate his version or may

      develop cold feet and not tell the truth or may

      repeat what he has been asked to say not knowing

      the consequences of his deposition in the court.

the incident in this case consists of the version given by

P.W.2 alone. Recalling the evidence of P.Ws.1 to 3, the child

was profusely bleeding after the incident and that is why

they had taken the child to the hospital.         However the

medical records Ext.P2 do not support the claim of P.Ws.1 to

with a knife appears for the first time while giving evidence

and was conspicuously absent in any other records. Going

by the version given by P.W.2, it would appear that there

was penetration, which is also belied by the medical

evidence. Therefore, this a case where the evidence of the

prosecutrix does not get support form the medical evidence

at all and in fact belies her version. Applying the principle in

the decision referred to above, it becomes impossible to

place implicit faith on the evidence of P.W.2.

</p><p id="p_39">              19.    One may   notice here  that going by the

prosecution case, when P.W.4 saw the child, the child was

seen washing off blood. At the time of evidence, there was

no attempt from the side of the prosecution to show that the

witness had narrated the incident as claimed by the

prosecution and the only evidence given by P.W.4 was that

she had helped the child to wash herself.

</p><p id="p_40">              20.    It was the above facts and circumstances

which make the trial court to suspect the prosecution case.

Of course, there is no suggestion to P.Ws.1 to 3 to the effect

that the accused had been falsely implicated due to political

rivalry.

<p id="p_42">              21. Learned Public Prosecutor pointed out that it

is rather inconceivable that a mother would allow her child

to be used as a victim of sexual assault to wreak political

vengeance and that aspect has been omitted to be noticed

by the trial court .
</p>
<p id="p_43">              22. As to what prompted P.W.2 to give evidence

as she did etc. are not matters for consideration now. The

evidence of P.W.2 will have to be analysed in the light of the

other circumstances in the case since there are other

evidence attempted by the prosecution to gain support to

the evidence furnished by P.W.2.       Of course, one has to

remember that in a case of rape, one has to considerably

depend upon the evidence of the prosecutrix, for, rape is

never done in open or on invitation. But, as rightly noticed

by the learned counsel for the accused, the evidence of the

prosecutrix must be of such a high standard, that it could

be believed. Bearing the above principles in mind, the court

below felt that it is not safe to rely on her evidence.

</p><p id="p_45">              23. One may remind oneself of the power of the

appellate court as laid down by the Apex Court in the

decision reported in K.Venkateshwarlu's case (supra)

wherein it was held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">              "This court has repeatedly stated what should

      be the approach of the High Court while dealing

      with an appeal against acquittal. If the view taken

      by the trial court is a reasonably possible view, the

      High Court cannot set it aside and substitute it by

      its own view merely because that view is also

      possible on the facts of the case. The High Court

      has to bear in mind that presumption of innocence

      of an accused is strengthened by his acquittal and

      unless       there  are    strong   and    compelling

      circumstances which rebut that presumption and

      conclusively establish the guilt of the accused, the

      order of acquittal cannot be set aside. Unless the

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      order of acquittal is perverse, totally against the

      weight of evidence and rendered in complete

      breach of settled principles underlying criminal

      jurisprudence, no interference is called for with it.

      Crime may be heinous, morally repulsive and

      extremely shocking, but moral considerations

      cannot be a substitute for legal evidence and the

      accused        cannot   be   convicted   on   moral

      considerations. The present appeal needs to be

      examined in the light of the above principles."




</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">              24.    Considering the evidence in its totality, it

could not be said that the court below has erred in any

manner in refusing to place complete faith in the evidence of

P.W.2, the victim. May be that the court had gone a little

too far characterizing the child as a tutored witness.

</blockquote><p id="p_47">However, unlike in normal cases,          the other items of

evidence adduced by the prosecution do not go along with

the evidence of P.W.2 and that aspect cannot be overlooked.

under <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_13">Section 354</a> of I.P.C. is made out, it is equally difficult

to accept the plea raised by the learned Public Prosecutor.

Learned Public Prosecutor relied on the entry in Ext.P10 to

support his contention. But there is no such case for P.W.2

and P.W.2 has an entirely different version.        Further, as

rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the accused,

the entry in Ext.P10 is not specifically put to the accused

when questioned under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_14">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C.

</p><p id="p_50">              26. Thus, it could be seen that on an appreciation

of the evidence, it is not possible to say that the findings

entered into by the court below are either perverse or totally

contrary to the evidence on record so as to warrant

interference in the appellate jurisdiction.         Probably a

different view may be possible. But that is not a ground to

interfere with the order of acquittal passed by the court

below which has the facility to watch the demeanor of the

witnesses.
