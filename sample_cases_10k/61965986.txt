IA 3304/2013 in CS(OS) 2617/2012

</p><p id="p_2">1.     Plaintiff has filed this Suit seeking recovery of Rs.
12,20,10,969/-, besides pendente lite and future interest at the rate of
9% per annum.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">IA 3304/2013 in CS(OS) 2617/2012                               Page 1 of 9</span>
<p id="p_3"> 2.     Defendant has filed the subject Application under Order 7 Rule
11 Code of Civil Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the Code)
seeking rejection of the plaint inter-alia, contending that the suit is
barred by limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.     It is a settled position of law that limitation is a mixed question
of law and fact. The statement in the plaint without addition or
subtraction must show that it is barred by any law to attract
application of Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. The principle is, therefore, well
settled that in order to examine whether the plaint is barred by any
law, as contemplated by clause (d) of Order 7 Rule 11 CPC, the
averments made in the plaint alone have to be seen and they have to
be assumed to be correct. It is not permissible to look into the pleas
raised in the written statement or to any piece of evidence1. Applying
the said principle, the plea raised by the Defendant that the Suit is
barred by limitation has to be examined by looking into the averments
made in the Plaint alone and the defence raised in the Written
Statement cannot at all be looked into.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.     Further, a plea of limitation cannot be decided as an abstract
principle of law divorced from facts as in every case the starting point
of limitation has to be ascertained which is entirely a question of fact.
A plea of limitation is a mixed question of law and fact.
</p>


<p id="p_6"> 1.   <a href="/doc/442517/" id="a_1">Ramesh B. Desai v. Bipin Vadilal Mehta</a>, (2006) 5 SCC 638



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">IA 3304/2013 in CS(OS) 2617/2012                                 Page 2 of 9</span>
</p><p id="p_7"> 5.     The case of the Plaintiff is that in pursuance to a tender notice,
it had submitted its bid and paid an EMD of 3.2 Crores on 02.06.1989,
which was acknowledged by the Defendant. It is contended that one
of the conditions proposed by the Plaintiff was that the land use would
be    got    changed      by       the   Defendant   from     industrial     to
commercial/residential. It is also averred that the defendant had
agreed to consider conversion of land use and had even agreed to
render necessary assistance in obtaining necessary permissions.
Subsequently, the plaintiff is contended to have conveyed to the
Defendant on 08.09.1989 that it was willing to abide by the condition
of the tender submitted by it and to conclude the purchase and have
the sale deed executed and pay the balance amount at the time of
taking possession of the site after the necessary permissions were
obtained by the Defendant. On 15.09.1989 the Chairman and
Managing Director of Defendant Company is alleged to have
informed the Plaintiff that the said amount has been kept in a separate
account as Short Term Deposit and the interest accrued after
05.09.1989 @ 8% interest per year would be credited in the account
of the Plaintiff in the event the deal is not materialized.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.     Later by letter dated 29.03.1991, the Defendant is alleged to
have informed the Plaintiff that the Government of Maharashtra had
published new Development Control Regulations-1991, which,
however were stayed by the Bombay High Court on 22.03.1991 and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">IA 3304/2013 in CS(OS) 2617/2012                                   Page 3 of 9</span>
 thus the board of directors of the defendant decided to refund back the
security deposit to the Plaintiff with interest at 8 % p.a. from
05.09.1989 till the date of payment.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.     It is contended that the defendant failed to refund the EMD of
Rs 3.2 Crores along with the interest. Subsequently, the Defendant is
alleged to have, on 05.03.1992 conveyed to the Plaintiff that sale deal
existed between them and requested the plaintiff to take necessary
action to complete the formalities towards the sale of the land to the
Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_10">8.     Immediately thereafter, reference was made by the defendant to
BIFR for the financial year ending 31.03.1992 and after making a
enquiry under Section 16 (1) SICA, BIFR declared the Defendant
company to be a sick company in the hearing held on 27.05.1993 and
thus appointed IDBI, a financial institution as the Operating Agency
under <a href="/doc/1130791/" id="a_2">Section 17(3)</a> of the SICA to formulate a rehabilitation scheme.
BIFR on 25.07.2002 sanctioned a rehabilitation scheme for the
Defendant. The claim(s) of the Plaintiff were however not included in
the said scheme. Plaintiff made an Application dated 07.06.2005
before BIFR for institution of recovery proceeding against the
Defendant for recovery of Rs. 3.2 crores with interest. Said
application was misplaced in the office of BIFR, thereafter a fresh
Application was filed by the Plaintiff on 25.11.2009 along with the
earlier application. By order dated 06.01.2010, BIFR directed the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">IA 3304/2013 in CS(OS) 2617/2012                             Page 4 of 9</span>
 Defendant company to refund the earnest money of Rs. 3.2 crores
within 3 weeks before 30.0l.2010, failing which, granted liberty to the
Plaintiff to take recourse for recovery with/ without interest of EMD.
On 27.01.2010 Defendant paid the said of Rs. 3.2 Crores being the
principal amount of the said Earnest Money and is accordingly,
alleged to have acknowledged its liability to pay and its indebtness
towards the Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.     In the appeal filed by the Plaintiff, before AAIFR, impugning
the order dated 06.01.2010 to the extent that it did not award interest
to the Plaintiff, by order dated 10.04.2012, AAIFR set aside the
direction of BIFR with regard to grant of interest on the EMD and
granted permission to the Plaintiff under <a href="/doc/162815/" id="a_3">section 22(1)</a> of SICA to
initiate recovery proceedings against the Defendant for recovery of
interest on the EMD. It further directed that if Plaintiff obtained a
decree in its favour, it would seek prior permission of the BIFR for
execution of the decree, in case the Defendant was not discharged
from the purview of SICA after full implementation of the sanctioned
scheme. The challenge of the Defendant to order dated 10.04.2012 of
AAIFR, in WP (C) No. 3288/2012, was unsuccessful and by order
dated 28.05.2012, the Division Bench left it open for the defendant to
oppose the suit filed by the Plaintiff pleading the bar of limitation and
the plaintiff to urge pleas to negate the plea of the claim of the
defendant of bar of limitation.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">IA 3304/2013 in CS(OS) 2617/2012                               Page 5 of 9</span>
<p id="p_12"> 10.    It is contended by the Plaintiff, in the plaint that the cause of
action for filing the suit arose and accrued in favour of the Plaintiff
when the Defendant in its board meeting dated 29.03.1991 decided to
refund the security deposit of Rs.320 lacs with interest @8% from
05.09.1989 till date of payment. It is further alleged to have arisen
when the Director of the Defendant for and on its behalf vide its letter
dated 05.03.1992 advised that a sale deal existed between the
Defendant and the Plaintiff and requested to take action to complete
the formalities for sale of land. The cause of action is further alleged
to have accrued when the Defendant Company made the reference
before BIFR for the financial year 31.03.1992 and the Defendant
Company was declared sick by BIFR on 27.05.1993. It is contended
that the Defendant Company was under the preview of <a href="/doc/438563/" id="a_4">Sick Industrial
Companies Act</a>, and particularly in view of <a href="/doc/1691689/" id="a_5">section 22</a> thereof, no
legal proceeding for recovery against the Defendant could be initiated.
The cause of action allegedly further arose when BIFR by order dated
06.01.2010 inter-alia directed the Defendant to refund earnest money
without interest. Further, when the Defendant paid back the earnest
money deposit on 27.01.2010 the sum of Rs.3.2 crores to the Plaintiff,
which was received by the Plaintiff without prejudice to their claim
for interest accrued, further on 10.04.2010, when the Plaintiff was
granted permission under <a href="/doc/162815/" id="a_6">Section 22(1)</a> of SICA by AAIFR by order
dated 10.04.2012 to initiate appropriate recovery proceedings against




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">IA 3304/2013 in CS(OS) 2617/2012                              Page 6 of 9</span>
 the Defendant for recovery of interest on the EMD. Present Suit was
filed in July 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_13">11.    The contentions of the Plaintiff are that there was no bar on the
Defendant Company to repay the earnest money deposited by the
Plaintiff under <a href="/doc/1691689/" id="a_7">section 22</a> of SICA, but the Defendant Company chose
not to repay the earnest money with interest as agreed between the
parties, hence the Plaintiff had no other alternative but to initiate
recovery proceeding against the Defendant Company. It is contended
that earnest money deposited by the Plaintiff was nothing but advance
to the company and thus was squarely covered by <a href="/doc/1691689/" id="a_8">Section 22</a> (1) of
SICA and without the consent of BIFR, recovery proceedings could
not be initiated against the Defendant Company.
</p>
<p id="p_14">12.    Further, it may also be noticed that Defendant was given
several opportunities to place on record the Financials as well as
"Form A", filed by it before BIFR, to show as to whether the amount
due to the Plaintiff was included in the scheme or not. Despite several
opportunities, said record has not been produced. Defendant has filed
an affidavit that despite best efforts, records were not made available
by BIFR as the same were not traceable and Registry of National
Company Law Tribunal stated that the records were not received from
BIFR and accordingly are misplaced.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">IA 3304/2013 in CS(OS) 2617/2012                              Page 7 of 9</span>
<p id="p_15"> 13.    When the averments in the plaint are examined in the light of
the legal principles, it is evident that the question of limitation, in the
present case, is a mixed question of law and facts and cannot be
decided without giving an opportunity to the parties to lead evidence
on the disputed questions of fact that are germane for the purposes of
deciding the issue of limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_16">14.    Further plea raised by the Defendant that the Plaint is liable to
be rejected as notice inviting tender was issued by the erstwhile NTC
(North Maharashtra) Ltd which was based out of Mumbai,
Maharashtra, the land is also located in Mumbai and the transactions
have all occurred in the city of Mumbai and the primary documents,
witnesses and events are all located in Mumbai and thus, Mumbai is
the more convenient forum and that the Defendant shall be subject to
great inconvenience and expenses and logistical hurdles to contest the
case in Delhi where no material cause of action has arisen, merits
rejection at the outset. Forum non conveniens is not a principle of
jurisdiction. It is a principle of convenience. It assumes in itself the
fact that both the forums have jurisdiction, however one should be
preferred over the other keeping in view the administrative
convenience of the court, parties and witnesses. Since it does not hit at
the very jurisdiction of the court to entertain a plaint, it cannot be
taken as a ground under order 7 rule 11 to hold that the Plaint is liable
to be rejected on the principle of being barred by law. Further, the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">IA 3304/2013 in CS(OS) 2617/2012                                 Page 8 of 9</span>
 Plaintiff has averred that the registered office of the Defendant is at
Delhi and part of cause of action to file the suit has arisen in Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_17">15.     In view of the above, I find no merit in the application it is
accordingly disposed of, leaving the issue of limitation open to be
framed and decided along with the other issues to be framed in the
Suit.
</p>
<p id="p_18">16.     List before the Roster bench for directions on 14.05.2018.
