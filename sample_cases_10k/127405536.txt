                                        LPA No. 327 of 2011 (O&amp;M)
                                        Date of Decision: 04.08.2011

Smt. Darshna Devi                                           ..Appellant


                                 Versus


State of Haryana and others                             ..Respondents


CORAM:       HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE M.M.KUMAR,
             HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ARVIND KUMAR,


Present :    Mr. Anil Malik, Advocate, for the appellant.

             Mr. Aman Chaudhary, Addl. Advocate General,
             Haryana, for the respondents.


1. Whether to be referred to the Reporters or not ?
2. Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest?

<p id="p_1">M.M.KUMAR, .J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">             The son of the appellant was offered compassionate

appointment of a Class-IV post on 29.01.2004. However, he was not

prepared to work as a Peon. He claimed the post of Clerk which was

not available. Thereafter, he also started claiming that he should be

paid ex-gratia grant for a sum of ` 2.5 lacs as compassionate

assistance in the alternative.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.           The learned Single Judge repelled the claim on the

ground that the appellant did not seem to suffer from any shortage of

funds because otherwise he would have accepted the job of Peon. The

learned Single Judge also held that such a huge lapse of time would

itself be sufficient to show that the son of the appellant as well as the
              LPA No. 327 of 2011 (O&amp;M)                   [2]



appellant herself, who is the widow are not in need of any State

assistance. They have proved by their acts and conducts that there was

no financial crisis for them to tide over.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.           Having heard the learned counsel for the parties we are of

the considered view that once the son of the appellant has refused to

work on a Class-IV post and insisted to a work on a white colour post

then it would not lead to passing of any order favourable to the

appellant. The appeal is wholly without merit and does not warrant

admission. Accordingly, the same is dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_2">
