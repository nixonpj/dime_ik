(By Sri. T. Seshagiri Rao, Advocate)


                               ****

      This writ petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the
Constitution of India praying to quash the impugned order dated
28.02.2018 passed by the Hon'ble City Civil Court, Bengaluru on
IA No.3 in O.S.No.6987/2017 (Annexure-E) and etc.,


      This writ petition coming on for preliminary hearing this day,
the Court made the following:
                                      3



                                ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      The petitioner is before this Court under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_2">Article 227</a> of the

Constitution of India challenging the order dated 28.02.2018 on

I.A.No.3 in O.S.No.6987/2017 on the file of City Civil Court,

Bengaluru.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">      2.   The petitioners are defendants and the respondent is

plaintiff in O.S.No.6987/2017, which is filed for permanent

injunction against defendants in respect of suit schedule land

bearing survey No.5 measuring 1 acre 5 guntas situated in

Basavanapura Village, K.R. Puram Hobli, Bengaluru East Taluk.



</p><p id="p_4">      3. On service of suit summons, the defendants appeared in

the suit and filed their written statement. In the written

statement, they contended that the suit schedule property is

cemetery and they are using it as cemetery for very long.          The

identity of the suit schedule property is also disputed by the

defendants. The plaintiff filed an application under Order 39 Rule 1

and   2    of   CPC   seeking   temporary   injunction   against   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      4</span>



defendants.    The exparte order of injunction is granted. On

appearance of defendants and filing objection, when matter was

at the stage of hearing on the said I.A for injunction, the plaintiff

filed application under Order 26 Rule 9 of CPC seeking to appoint

a Court Commissioner so as to ascertain whether the photographs

produced by the defendants would pertain to the suit schedule

property or not.     It is pertinent to mention here that the

defendants had produced certain photographs along with their

objection to the I.A. for temporary injunction and the plaintiff had

also produced certain photographs to show the suit schedule

property. In that circumstance, the trial Court considered the said

application and by its order dated 28.02.2018 allowed I.A.No.3

filed under Order 26 Rule 9 of CPC and directed to suggest the

name of the Commissioner along with memo of instructions. The

said order is under challenge in the present writ petition.



</p><p id="p_5">      4.   Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the

writ papers.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      5</span><p id="p_6">



</p><p id="p_7">     5.   The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that

I.A.No.3 filed under Order 26 Rule 9 read with Section 151 of CPC

is premature and at this stage, the Court could not have allowed

the application for appointment of Court Commissioner.         Further

he submits that identity of the suit schedule property itself is in

dispute and the plaintiff has not produced any sort of material for

identification of the land. It is further submitted by the learned

counsel for the petitioners that the Commissioner could be

appointed only on completion of the evidence and at this stage,

the Commissioner cannot be appointed to collect evidence.           On

the other hand, learned counsel for the Caveator-respondent

submits   that   allowing   the   application   for   appointment    of

Commissioner is proper in the facts and circumstances of the

case. As there are two sets of photographs, one produced by the

plaintiff and other produced by the defendants, to get the

clarification with regard to photographs produced by defendants,

the Court has rightly appointed the Commissioner. It is further

submitted that he has produced documents to show his title and

possession over the suit schedule property.           It is his further
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      6</span>



contention that the suit schedule property is not a cemetery nor

any tomb exists in the said land.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">      6.     The   order   under    challenge   is   appointment    of

Commissioner under Order 26 Rule 9 read with 151 of CPC. The

plaintiff sought for appointment of Commissioner to ascertain

whether the photographs produced by defendants would pertain

to the suit schedule property. The trial Court only to that extent

has allowed the appointment of Commissioner. The contention of

the petitioner that suit schedule property is not identifiable, is not

a question to be decided at present.        The suit has been filed

claiming that the suit schedule property is acquired by virtue of

partition deed dated 13.02.2004 and she is in possession since

then. It is a suit for bare injunction. It is for the parties to prove

their case and the Court has to find out, who is in possession of

the suit schedule property for the purpose of granting Injunction.

When there are two sets of photographs produced by both the

parties to find out the truthfulness of the photographs, the trial

Court thought it to fit to appoint a Commissioner to find out as to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      7</span>



whether those photographs pertain to suit schedule property. The

Commissioner is not appointed for collection of evidence as

contended by the petitioners. If that be the case, the Court could

not   have   appointed   the   Commissioner   at   this   stage.   The

Commissioner is appointed only to find out whether photographs

produced are of suit schedule property. The Commissioner is not

appointed to find out as to who is in possession or for any other

purpose. I do not find any error or irregularity in appointing the

Commissioner to the extent for which the trial Court has

appointed. The petitioner has not made out any ground to

interfere with the order passed by the trial Court.


</p><p id="p_10">      Accordingly, petition is dismissed as devoid of merits.
