<p id="p_67">     These petitions coming on for admission, this day,
the Court made the following:

      Even though these petitions are at the stage of

admission, with the consent of counsel for the petitioner

and the learned Additional State Public Prosecutor,

arguments are heard for final disposal of the petition.
</p>

<p id="p_69">      2.   In these petitions, the petitioner has sought to

quash the criminal proceedings initiated against them for

the alleged offences punishable under Sections 78(3) of

the Karnataka Police Act, 1963 ('the KP Act', for short) on

the   ground   of   non-compliance    of   the   mandatory

requirements prescribed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_29">Section 155(2)</a> of the

Code of Criminal Procedure.
</p>


<p id="p_70">      3.   The common contentions urged in all these

petitions are that, the offence alleged against the

petitioner is a non-cognizable offence and by virtue of the

safeguard provided under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_30">Section 155(2)</a> of Cr.P.C., the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                              13</span>




respondent - Police could not have embarked upon

investigation into the alleged offence, without the order of

a Magistrate having power to try such case.
