                                                              -vs-
                                                      State of West Bengal &amp; Ors


                Md. Golam Mostafa             ... For the Petitioner

                Ms. Santi Das
                Ms. Sumana Chakraborty        ... For Respondent No. 5</pre>

                              Application       of     the    petitioner,     seeking
                appointment on compassionate ground, was rejected by
                respondent no. 5 on the ground that the petitioner could
                not pass Madhyamik Examination or its equivalent within
                two years from the date of death of his father.
</p>

<p id="p_2">                              It    appears     that    the    widow        made   an
                application within the statutory period for appointment of
                the petitioner though the petitioner could not qualify the
                Madhyamik Examination at that point of time.
</p>

<p id="p_3">                              After passing the Madhyamik Examination,
                mother of the petitioner made a further application
                renewing her prayer for appointment of her son on
                compassionate ground.          The said application is rejected
                on the ground that the writ petitioner could not qualify
                the Madhyamik Examination within the statutory period
                as provided under the Statutory Rules.
</p>

<p id="p_4">                              It   is   no    doubt    true   that   initiation    for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                           2</span>


appointment on compassionate ground was started within
the stipulated period and further application was made
after having acquired the requisite qualification.
</p><p id="p_5">                   W.P. 19891 (W) of 2005


            Once initiation is made within the stipulated
period any subsequent application cannot be brushed
aside on the ground that it is filed beyond the statutory
period.
</p>

<p id="p_6">            It has been held by the Division Bench of this
Court in the case of <a href="/doc/42419038/" id="a_1">Sraban Kumar Choudhury -vs- State
of West Bengal &amp; Ors</a>., reported in (2011) 2 WBLR (Cal)
141, that an application, after the statutory period of two
years by the minor after attaining majority, cannot be
thrown out on the ground that the same has been filed
beyond the statutory period. Thus, the order, passed by
the authority rejecting the application of the petitioner, is
not sustainable and the same is hereby set aside and
quashed.
</p>

<p id="p_7">            The Chairman, Murshidabad District Primary
School Council, respondent no. 5, is directed to consider
the said application afresh on merit treating the same
having been filed within the stipulated period and such
decision should be taken within six weeks from the date
of communication of this order.         After taking such
decision, the authority shall communicate the same to the
petitioner within a week thereafter.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>

<p id="p_8">               The writ petition, accordingly, stands disposed of.
However, there will be no order as to costs.
</p>

<p id="p_9">               Urgent photostat certified copy be supplied to
the parties, if applied for, on priority basis.
