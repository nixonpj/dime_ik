<p id="p_1">                    Re : CAN 5771 of 2015 and CAN 5759 of 2015.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                    In these two applications the appellants/petitioners have prayed for recalling of the order

             dated November 22, 2013 passed by a learned Single Judge of this Court dismissing both the

             appeals of the respective appellants, namely, S.A. 21 of 2001 and S.A. 22 of 2001 on the ground of

             default.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                    Mr. Chatterjee, learned senior counsel appearing in support of both the applications, drew

             my attention to the statements made in these applications to the effect that due to personal ground,

             the advocate on record of the appellants could not be present before this Court on November 22,

             2013. It is further stated that an application for substitution of the legal heirs of the deceased sole

             appellant in SA 22 of 2001 had already been filed before the said order of dismissal dated

             November 22, 2013 was passed.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                    2</span><p id="p_4">


       Mr. Kallol Basu, learned counsel appearing for the respondents in both the appeals,

vehemently opposed the prayer of the appellants in these applications.

</p><p id="p_5">       Considering the statements made in these applications, I am satisfied that the appellants in

the above two appeals have sufficiently explained the reasons, which prevented their advocate to be

present before this Court on November 22, 2013.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       Accordingly, the order dated November 22, 2013 passed by this Court stands recalled and

both the appeals being SA 21 of 2001 and SA 22 of 2001 stand restored to their original file and

number. The interim orders passed in the above two appeals also stand restored. Since there was

an earlier direction for analogous hearing of both the appeals, both the applications being CAN

5771 of 2015 and CAN 5759 of 2015 stand disposed of by this common order.

</p><p id="p_7">       Let the applications being CAN 41 of 2004 and CAN 19 of 2011 appear in the list under the

heading 'Application' on June 29, 2015.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       The appellants are directed to serve copies of the said two applications on the advocate on

record of the respondents by tomorrow.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       Since it appears that in view of the dismissal of both the appeals by the said order dated

November 22, 2013 the lower court records have already been sent back, let the lower court records

be called back immediately and the appellants are directed to deposit the requisite fees for bringing

the lower court records by special messenger. Such fees must be paid within June 28, 2015.

</p><p id="p_10">       Certified website copies of the order, if applied for, be urgently made available to the

parties, subject to compliance with all requisite formalities.
