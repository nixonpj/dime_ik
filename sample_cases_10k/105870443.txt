<p id="p_1">      CORAM: - HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJESH SHANKAR

For the Petitioner       :- None
For the Resp.nos. 1 to 7 :- Mr. Rishikesh Giri, AC to G.A.-IV

Order No.-05                                       Dated: 19.11.2019
      No one appears on behalf of the petitioner whereas
Mr. Rishikesh Giri, AC to G.A.-IV, is present on behalf of the
respondent nos. 1 to 7.
</p><p id="p_2">      The present writ petition has been filed for quashing the order
as contained in memo no. 254 dated 09.05.2007 (Annexure-4 to the
writ petition) passed by the Joint Registrar, Co-Operative Societies,
Santhal Pargana Division, Dumka whereby the order               dated
09.03.2007 passed by the respondent no. 4- the Assistant Registrar,
Co-operative societies, Deoghar Circle, Deoghar dissolving the
Management Committee of Punasi PACS under Section 41 (5) (a) (b)
of <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_1">Co-Operative Societies Act</a>, 1935 (in short "the Act, 1935"), has
been declared illegal.
</p><p id="p_3">      Further prayer has been made for quashing the order as
contained in memo no. 487 dated 20.03.2008 (Annexure-8/2 to the
writ petition) passed by the respondent no. 5- the Deputy
Commissioner, Deoghar whereby the order dated 03.03.2008 staying
the construction of godown by Punasi Pacs in Singhjori village, has
been vacated. The petitioner has also prayed for issuance of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2</span>



         direction upon the respondent authorities to construct the godown in
         Punasi village in place of Singhjori Village and further for staying the
         orders dated 09.05.2007 and 20.03.2008 during the pendency of the
         writ petition.
</p><p id="p_4">                Reference may be made to the order dated 05.11.2019
         whereby Mr. Deepak Kumar, learned counsel for the petitioner, was
         directed to apprise this Court as to whether the prayer made in the
         writ petition still survives.
</p><p id="p_5">                Learned counsel for the respondent nos. 1 to 7 submits that
         the present writ petition was filed in the year 2008 and during the
         said period, the tenure of the Managing Committee of the co-
         operative societies used to be three years. Learned counsel while
         referring paragraphs- 7 and 8 of the counter affidavit filed on behalf
         of the respondent no. 4, submits that eight members of the
         Managing Committee of Punasi PACS had submitted their resignation
         to the respondent no. 4 and thereby they ceased to be the members
         of the said Managing Committee. It is further submitted that since
         the majority of the members of the said PACS had submitted their
         resignation, the Managing Committee of the PACS was liable to be
         dissolved under <a href="/doc/183366361/" id="a_2">Section 41</a> (5) (a) of the Act, 1935.
</p><p id="p_6">                Be that as it may. The present writ petition was filed in the
         year 2008 challenging the action taken by the respondent no. 4
         dissolving the Managing Committee of the said PACS. Since, the
         counsel for the petitioner has not apprised this Court as to whether
         the prayer of the petitioner made in the writ petition still survives,
         keeping in view the nature of the same, it cannot be entertained
         after lapse of about more than 11 years.
</p><p id="p_7">                The writ petition is thus dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                                                        (Rajesh Shankar, J.)
