   S. B. CRIMINAL REVISION PETITION NO. 319/1996
        (Omprakash Vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; Anr.)

                 DATE OF ORDER : 13.7.2012

          HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANDEEP MEHTA

Mr. Suresh Kumbhat, for the petitioner.
Mr. Ashok Prajapat, Public Prosecutor.
Mr. R.K. Bohra, for the respondent No.2.


      The instant revision petition has been filed on behalf of the

petitioner-complainant challenging the order dated 24.2.1996

passed by the learned Civil Judge (J.D.) cum Judicial Magistrate,

Pilibanga in Criminal Case No.291/94, whereby, the learned trial

court has acquitted the respondent No.2 from the charges for

the offences under <a href="/doc/203036/" id="a_1">Sections 354</a> and <a href="/doc/68146/" id="a_2">509</a> IPC.

      Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the

learned trial court has committed grave error in acquitting the

respondent No.2 from the aforesaid charges. He submits that the

aggrieved person Smt.'K' was not cross-examined regarding her

averment on oath that the accused molested and outraged her

modesty. He     therefore   submits   that the acquittal   of   the

respondent No.2 as recorded by the learned trial court is

absolutely uncalled for.

      Learned counsel for the respondent No.2 submits that the

FIR in this case was filed by the husband of the aggrieved lady

and there is no allegation in the FIR that the respondent No.2

outraged the modesty of a lady by touching her chest.

      Having heard and considered the arguments advanced by

learned counsel for the parties at the bar and upon perusal of

the record of the case, it is evident that in the FIR the fact

regarding the respondent No.2 having touched the chest of the

lady and thereby having outraged her modesty is conspicuously
                                  2.

missing. The respondent No.2 had pleaded that some money

was given to the first informant petitioner Om Prakash before

lodging of the FIR and for this reason a false case has been

registered against him. A specific suggestion in this regard was

made to the aggrieved lady Smt.'K' as well as the first informant

Om Prakash. The respondent No.2 himself appeared as a

defence witness and has produced on record the documents for

the purpose of showing that there were some financial dealings

between him and the complainant Om Prakash. No suggestion

has been given to the respondent No.2 in his cross examination

that he outraged the modesty of Smt.'K'.

       In view of these facts, it cannot be said that the order

passed by the learned trial court acquitting the respondent No.2

for the aforesaid offences is perverse or illegal so as to call for

any interference in the instant revision petition. That apart, a

period of more than 18 years has lapsed since the incident took

place, therefore, there cannot be any justification in interfering

with the well reasoned judgment of acquittal dated 24.2.1996

passed by the learned trial court.

       Resultantly, the revision petition being bereft of any force

is hereby dismissed.

                                           (SANDEEP MEHTA), J.
