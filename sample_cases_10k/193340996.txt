                                         W.P. 13543(W) of 2010

        RE: An application for recalling being C.A.N. 6576/2010.
</p>
<pre id="pre_1">        Mr. Fazle Rabi,                  ... for the petitioner

        Ms. Santi Das,
                                  ... for the applicant/Board


</pre><p id="p_2">                This is an application praying for recalling of the order
        dated      15th     July,      2010    passed    by    this    Court    whereby     the
        applicant/Board was called upon to produce the petitioner's answer
        script     in      respect     of     Physical   Science      paper    pertaining     to
        Secondary Examination, 2010 on 28th July, 2010. It has been averred
        in   the    application        that   the    learned   Advocate   representing      the
        applicant/Board, inadvertently, did not draw the attention of the
        Court to the contents of paragraph 4 of the writ petition wherein
        it is the admitted case of the petitioner that he had applied for
        post publication review of the said answer script.
</p><p id="p_3">                The contents of paragraph 4 of the writ petition ought to
        have been taken into consideration while passing the order dated
        15th July, 2010. Inadvertently, it was not noticed. This Court
        finds sufficient reason to recall the order dated 15th July, 2010.
        It is ordered accordingly. The application for recalling being
        C.A.N. 6576/2010 stands allowed.
</p><p id="p_4">                The writ petition is taken up for consideration, treated as
        on day's list.
</p><p id="p_5">                The petitioner has sought for production of answer script
        written by him in respect of Physical Science paper pertaining to
        Secondary Examination, 2010 conducted by the Board.
</p><p id="p_6">                It is not in dispute that the examinee has applied for post
        publication scrutiny, the result whereof is awaited.
</p><p id="p_7">                It is settled law that a writ petition cannot be pursued as a
        parallel remedy.
</p><p id="p_8">                This      Court   is   thus    not   inclined   to    entertain    this     writ
        petition. The same stands disposed of with a direction upon the
        Board to expedite the process of post publication scrutiny and to
        ensure that the examinee is informed of the result thereof as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 2</span>




early as possible but not later than 21 days from date of receipt
of a copy of this order.
</p><p id="p_9">     Urgent certified photostat copy of this order, if applied
for, be supplied to the petitioner as early as possible.
</p>


<p id="p_10">                                               (Dipankar Datta, J)
