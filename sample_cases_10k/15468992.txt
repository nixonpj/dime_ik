CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE JASWANT SINGH


Present:    Mr. Binderjit Singh, Advocate for the petitioner.

            Mr. Vaibhav Sharma, Deputy Advocate General, Punjab
            for the respondents/State.

                       ****
JASWANT SINGH, J. (Oral)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">             The petitioner was offered contractual appointment as a

Computer Teacher under the Information &amp; Communication Technology

(ICT) Project on consolidated remuneration of ` 7,000/- per month for a

period of one year vide appointment letter dated 01.09.2009 (Annexure

P-1). One of the specific conditions was that the petitioner was to join the

duty at the named School within 07 days from the receipt of the

appointment letter. Failing which, the offer of appointment was to be

deemed to have lapsed. The petitioner, owing to her delivery by caesarean

section on 16.08.2009, vide her request dated 22.09.2009 (Annexure P-4),

prayed for extension of the joining date by three months i.e. 24.11.2009.

The request 'in toto' was accepted by the respondent-Society vide order

dated 28.10.2009 (Annexure R-2). Thereafter, neither any request for

further extension is alleged to have been made nor the petitioner is stated to

have joined her place of posting.

            Learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that thereafter vide

requests dated 27.10.2009 (Annexure P-5) and 08.12.2009 (Annexure

P-6), further extensions were sought, however, no communication on that

requests was ever communicated to the petitioner. Therefore, he submits

that a mandamus be issued directing the respondents to allow the petitioner

to join as Computer Teacher on contract basis.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            Upon notice, two separate replies have been filed, one on behalf

of respondent Nos.1 and 3 and other on behalf of respondent No.2. In the

reply, it is asserted that after the first request, no further request for

extending the time was ever made or received as per the record till the

requests dated 11.04.2012 (Annexure P-12) and 16.01.2013 (Annexure

P-13) after a gap of 3-4 years, which was rejected. It is further submitted

that apart from the claim being barred by limitation, the vacant posts have

been re-advertised and the process for the same has also completed.

</p><p id="p_4">            After hearing learned Counsel for the parties, no case for

interference is warranted.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            It is not in dispute that the petitioner had received the

communication regarding extension of the joining time till 24.11.2009 as is

evident from her own letter dated 08.12.2009 (P-6), requesting further

extension for three months, which the department claims have never

received. Even if P-6 was ever made, it is a matter of fact that no further

extension was ever heard of by the petitioner. The petitioner herself should

have been vigilant enough to either join in time or keep herself updated of

the developments in the Office of the respondents and, therefore, her plea

that for 2-3 years, she did not hear anything from the department on her

requests for further extension is a complete afterthought and made only in
                               2 of 3

view of the fact that the such contractual employees are subsequently being

regularized in service. The petitioner thus is estopped by her own conduct

apart from the claim being barred by limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            Accordingly, the present petition stands dismissed with costs of

` 10,000/- to be deposited with District Legal Services Authority, Shaheed

Bhagat Singh Nagar (Nawanshahr) within two months from today. Failing

which, the Member Secretary concerned shall take steps to recover the same

as arrears of land revenue.

S.B.S. Nagar for strict compliance.
