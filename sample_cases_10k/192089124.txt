</pre><p id="p_1">1.        This   judgment   shall   dispose   off   the   case   instituted  under

<a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_2">Section 25</a> of Arms Act, 1959 against the accused.

</p><p id="p_2">2.        The allegations against the accused, as detailed in the charge­

sheet are that on 26.06.2007, he was found in possession of a button

actuated knife in contravention of provisions of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_3">Arms Act</a>, 1959.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            2</span>


</p><p id="p_3">3.       After   completion   of   investigation,   charge­sheet   was   filed.

After compliance of <a href="/doc/1613898/" id="a_4">Section 207</a>  Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.

Charge was framed under <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_5">Section   25</a> of Arms Act, 1959 against the

accused vide order dated 25.07.2007, to which the accused pleaded

not guilty and claimed trial.  
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.       Prosecution adduced evidence in support of its case. PW­1 is

the duty officer. He deposed about registration of FIR. PW­2 to PW­4

deposed to the recovery and seizure of button actuated knife from the

accused. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.       After   closure   of   prosecution   evidence,   the   statement   of   the

accused   was   recorded   under   <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_6">Section   313</a>   of   Code   of   Criminal

Procedure, 1973.  Incriminating evidence was put  to the accused. He

denied all the allegations and stated that he is innocent and has been

falsely   implicated   in   this   case.   The   accused   opted   not   to   lead   any

evidence in his defence.  
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.       Final arguments advanced by Ld. APP for State and Mr. R.L.

Saini, Legal Aid counsel for accused are heard.

</p><p id="p_7">7.       Public witnesses were admittedly not joined in investigation

though available. The testimony of official witnesses does not find any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          3</span>


corroboration   from   any   independent   source.   In   my   view,   the   non­

joining of public witness is fatal to the prosecution case, particularly

when no reasonable explanation has been given by prosecution for

not joining public witnesses.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       In case titled as Roop Chand Vs. State of Haryana   reported as

CC Cases 3 (HC),   it was held as that where the police has failed to

join   independent   witnesses   in   the   investigation   despite   their

availability and further failed to take action against those who refused

to take part in investigation nor their names were noted down by the

police,   the   explanation   of   the   police   for   not     joining  independent

witnesses is an afterthought and liable to be rejected.

</p><p id="p_9">       In the case of <a href="/doc/1551054/" id="a_7">Hem Raj v. State of Haryana</a> AIR 2005 SC 2110, it

has been observed that :­ 

           "The   fact   that   no   independent   witness   though   available,   was
           examined and not even an explanation was sought to be given for
           not   examining   such   witness   is   a   serious   infirmity   in   the
           prosecution   case.   Amongst   the   independent   witnesses   one   who
           was very much in the know of things from the beginning was not
           examined   by   the   prosecution.   Non­examination   of   independent
           witness by itself may not give rise to adverse inference against the
           prosecution.   However,   when   the   evidence   of   the   alleged   eye­
           witnesses raise serious doubts on the point of their presence at the
           time of actual occurrence, the unexplained omission to examine
           the independent witness would assume significance."
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           4</span>


      In the case of <a href="/doc/1865576/" id="a_8">Sahib Singh v. State of Punjab</a> AIR 1997 SC 2417, it

has been held as under:­ 

          "Having gone through the record we find much substance in each
          of the above contentions. Before conducting a search the concerned
          police   officer   is   required   to   call   upon   some   independent   and
          respectable people of the locality to witness the search. In a given
          case it may so happen that no such person is available or, even if
          available, is not willing to be a party to such search. It may also be
          that after joining the search, such persons later on turn hostile. In
          any of these eventualities the evidence of the police officers who
          conducted the search cannot be disbelieved solely on the ground
          that   no   independent   and   respectable   witness   was   examined   to
          prove the search but if it is found ­ as in the present case ­ that no
          attempt was even made by the concerned police officer to join with
          him some persons of the locality who were admittedly available to
          witness the recovery, it would affect the weight of evidence of the
          Police Officer, though not its admissibility."

      In the case of <a href="/doc/87706/" id="a_9">D. V. Shanmugham v. State of A.P</a>.,  AIR 1997 SC

2583 it has been observed as under:­

          "It also appeared from the evidence of PW­2 and PW­8 that there
          were several other people who witnessed the occurrence and they
          are not the residents of that locality. If such independent witnesses
          were available and yet were not examined by the prosecution and
          only those persons who  are related to the deceased were examined
          then in such a situation the prosecution case has to be scrutinised
          with more care and caution."
</p>
<p id="p_10">      In   the   case   of    Pawan   Kumar   Vs.   The   Delhi   Administration,

1989 Cr.LJ  127 Delhi, in which it was observed as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          "Kalam  Singh has to  admit that at the time  of the arrest  and
          recovery of the knife, there was a lot of rush of public at the bus
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                              5</span>


            stop near Subhash Bazar. According to Jagbir Singh, he did not
            join   any   public   witness   in   the   case   while   according   to   Kalam
            Singh, no public person was present there.   It hardly stands to
            reason that at a place like a bus stop near Subhash Bazar, there
            would be no person present at a crucial time like 7.30 pm when
            there is a lot of rush of commuters for boarding the buses to their
            respective   destinations.  Admittedly,   there   is   no   impediment   in
            believing   the   version   of   the   police   officials   but   for   that   the
            prosecution has to lay a good  foundation.  At least one of them
            should   have   deposed   that   they   tried   to   contact   the   public
            witnesses or that they  refused to join the investigation.  Here is a
            case where no effort was made to join any public witness even
            though number of them were present. No plausible from the side
            of the prosecution is forthcoming for not joining the Independent
            witnesses in case of a serious nature like the present one.  It may
            be that there is an apathy on the part of the general public to
            associate themselves with the police raids or the recoveries but
            that apart, at least the IO should have made an earnest effort to
            join   the   independent   witnesses.     No   attempt   in   this   direction
            appears to have been made and this, by itself, is a circumstance
            throwing doubt on the arrest or the recovery of the knife from the
            person of the  accused.''

       In the case of Sadhu Singh Vs. State of Haryana 2000 (2) CC

Cases HC 73, the Court took note of the fact that public witnesses

were not joined in investigation to acquit the accused. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       In  the  case  of   Massa   Singh   Vs.  State  of  Punjab   2000   (2)  C.C.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">Cases   HC   11,   conviction   was   set   aside   on   the   ground   that   it   was

obligatory   on   the   part   of   investigating   officer   to   take   assistance   of

independent   witnesses   to   lend   authenticity   to   the   investigation

conducted by him. It was observed as under:­
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                            6</span>


                  "The recovery has been effected from a public place. The
           Investigating Officer could have taken the trouble to associate an
           independent   witness   to   get   the   attestation   of   such   independent
           witness regarding the authenticity of the investigation conducted
           by him. This aspect of the case has not been properly appreciated
           by the Court below."
</p>
<p id="p_12">       In   the  case   of   Chanan   Singh   Vs.   State   1986   Crl.   Rev.   No.720

(P&amp;H) 94, it was held that it was obligatory on the part of the police to

join independent witnesses and the statement of official witness that

witnesses refused to join investigation was rejected as an afterthought.

</p><p id="p_13">       In the cases of Gurbel Singh Vs. State of Punjab 1991 Crl.Rev.

No.504 (P&amp;H) and Dhanpat  Vs. State of Punjab 2000 (1) CC Cases HC

52, it has been held that non­joining of independent witnesses is fatal

to the prosecution case and accused is entitled to benefit of doubt.

</p><p id="p_14">8.       In the present case also, PW­2 is the recovery officer. He has

not   mentioned   that   any   further   effort   was   made   to   join   public

witnesses in the search. There is no evidence on record to show that

effort is made to join public witnesses. 
</p>
<p id="p_15">9.       There are other inconsistencies on the record which have not

been explained. According to the depositions of prosecution witness,

the case property was first seized and then rukka was prepared for

registration of FIR. Thus according to the witness, FIR was registered
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                            7</span>


after   seizure   of   knife.   However,   the   seizure   memo   bears   the   FIR

number. At the time of the seizure, FIR number was not available and

therefore, FIR number could not have figured on the seizure memo.

The   existence   of   FIR   number   on   seizure   memo   suggests   that   the

seizure   memo   was   prepared   after   the   registration   of   FIR   and   is

therefore ante­timed. This erodes the credibility of the witness who

has stated that the seizure memo was prepared on the spot and before

the registration of FIR.    
</p>
<p id="p_16">10.        In view of the aforementioned facts and circumstances, I am

of the opinion that prosecution has failed to prove its case against the

accused   beyond   reasonable   doubt.     I   give   benefit   of   doubt   to   the

accused.   Accused   is   accordingly   acquitted.   Case   property   be

confiscated   to   the   State   and   be   destroyed   after   expiry   of   period  of

appeal.  File be consigned to Record Room, after due compliance.
