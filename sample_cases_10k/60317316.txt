Brief reasons for decision:

</pre><p id="p_1">1.               The story of the prosecution in brief is as under :
</p>
<p id="p_2">                 Sanjeet Kumar used to reside alongwith his brother at E-1621,

Jahangirpuri, Delhi. He used to work as a supervisor in a factory situated at S-82,

Badli Industrial Area, Delhi. He also used to operate the machine in the absence

of any labourer. On 7.03.1996 at around 3.00 pm, he was operating the standing

machine at the factory as the worker who used to work on the said machine was

absent. He met with an accident while operating the said machine. His left hand

came in the said machine and his three fingers were cut. He was taken to ESI



FIR no. 188/96                                                                        1/3
 Hospital for medical treatment.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             The information regarding the incident was received at PS Samay Pur

Badli vide DD no. 54 B. On gaining the said information, SI Gurnam Singh

alongwith Constable Jatin Kumar reached ESI Hospital. IO obtained the MLC of

the injured and recorded the statement of the complainant Prem Kumar. In the

said background, FIR no. 188/96 under <a href="/doc/180291/" id="a_3">Section 287</a>/<a href="/doc/1402213/" id="a_4">337</a> IPC was registered at PS

SP Badli. The concerned doctor has opined the nature of injuries sustained by the

complainant to be grevious. The charges under <a href="/doc/1721129/" id="a_5">Section 338</a> IPC were substituted.

</p><p id="p_4">2.           Investigation were carried out. Site plan was prepared by the

investigating officer SI Gurnam Singh and the statement of the witnesses were

recorded. On completion of the investigation, chargesheet under Section 173 Cr.

PC was filed against the accused Naresh. The copies of chargesheet were supplied

to the accused in compliance of the section 207 Cr. PC. The accused has been

charged for the offence under <a href="/doc/180291/" id="a_6">Section 287</a>/<a href="/doc/1721129/" id="a_7">338</a> IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.           During the entire trial which lasted for more than 14 years, the

prosecution has examined only two witnesses.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.           PW-1 Dr. Sanjeev Kumar, Medical Officer, ESI Hospital. He is the

Doctor who has medically examined the injured Prem Kumar Singh vide MLC Ex.

PW-1/A. He has stated that after examining the injured, he referred him to the

Department of Ortho for detailed examination. He has opined the nature of injury

sustained as grevious. PW-2 Constable Jatin Kumar is the police personnel who

has accompanied the IO SI Gurnam Singh to the hospital after receiving the

information regarding the incident vide DD no. 54 B. He has proved the initial

part of the investigation in his deposition.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5.           In the present matter, neither the complainant/injured nor any other



FIR no. 188/96                                                               2/3
 eye witness to the incident has been examined by the prosecution. Summons

issued to the complainant Prem Kumar were repeatedly received back with the

report that the witness is not traceable. Summons issued through the IO as well as

the concerned DCP were also received back with report that the complainant is

not traceable. The investigating officer SI Gurnam Singh has also not been

examined. Keeping in view the said circumstances and taking note of the fact that

the trial had already lasted for 14 years, the prosecution evidence was closed.

</p><p id="p_8">6.          On appreciation of the deposition of the witnesses, it is evident that

the witnesses examined on record have deposed in regard to the facts subsequent

to the incident. PW-1 Dr. Sanjeev Kumar is the Medical Officer who has proved

the MLC of the injured Prem Kumar. Similarly, PW-2 Constable Jatin Kumar has

proved the initial part of the investigation. The sole eye witness to the incident

i.e. the complainant has not been examined as witness. There is no evidence to

substantiate the charges against the accused Naresh. The non examination of the

complainant is fatal for the prosecution. Since no incriminating evidence has come

forward against the accused, therefore, recording of the statement under Section

313 Cr. PC is dispensed with. Charges under <a href="/doc/180291/" id="a_8">Section 287</a>/<a href="/doc/1721129/" id="a_9">338</a> IPC are not

established. Accordingly, accused Naresh stands acquitted of the said charges.

Surety for the accused also stands discharged. Any endorsement placed on the

documents of the surety be cancelled and returned to him, if retained on record.

File be consigned to record room after necessary compliance.
