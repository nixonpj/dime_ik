Dates of Hearing                :     19.11.2013

Date of Judgment &amp; Order        :     19th November, 2013.


                      JUDGMENT AND ORDER (ORAL)

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              This appeal by the plaintiffs is directed against the judgment

and decree dated 31.07.2002 passed by the learned Civil Judge (Sr.

</blockquote><p id="p_5">Division), Morigaon, in Title Appeal No.11/2001, dismissing the appeal

preferred by the present appellants and affirming the judgment and

decree dated 10.08.2001 passed by the learned Civil Judge (Jr.

Division) No.1, Morigaon, in Title Suit No.21/1993, whereby and

whereunder the suit of the present appellants/plaintiffs has been

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">2.            The   predecessor-in-interest   of   the   present   appellants,

namely, Sadhan Ch. Hazarika, instituted Title Suit No.8/1990 in the

Court of the learned Civil Judge, Nagaon, which suit was subsequently

transferred to the Court of the learned Civil Judge (Jr. Division) No.1,

Morigaon, on creation of Morigaon Judicial District and consequently the

suit has been renumbered as Title Suit No.21/1993, praying for the

decree declaring his right, title and interest over the land measuring 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">RSA 50/2003                                                           Page 2 of 8</span>
 bigha 16½ lechas, being half of the Schedule-(a) land and also for

eviction of the defendant Nos.1 to 4, contending inter alia that originally

land measuring 2 bighas 1 katha 13 lechas, described in Schedule-(a)

to the plaint, belonged to Matia Nadial, along with whose name, the

name of Shri Rameswar Bar Hazarika was mutated in the revenue

records on 08.01.1900 in respect of half of the Schedule-(a) land and

hence Rameswar had acquired right, title and interest in respect of half

of the Schedule-(a) land. It has further been contended that after the

death of Rameswar the said land devolved on Madan, his son, after

whose death the same devolved on his son Sadhan and thereafter on

the plaintiff, she being the widow of Sadhan. It has also been pleaded

that taking advantage of absence of Sadhan, the original plaintiff,

Gopal, son of Dayal, who is the son of Matia Nadial, transferred 2

kathas of land in favour of Balaram, whose heirs in turn sold the same

in favour of defendant No.4. It has also been pleaded that Atul

(defendant No.1), who claims to be the son of Gopal also sold 1 katha

17½ lechas of land in favour of defendant No.2. Further pleaded case is

that Hazarika Kaibarta (proforma defendant No.5), who is the grand son

of Matia Nadial through Gandhak, son of Matia, sold 2 kathas 18 lechas

of land in favour of defendant No.2. The plaintiff claims that since he is

the successor-in-interest of Rameswar Bar Hazarika, he has the right,

title and interest in respect of half of the Schedule-(a) land and hence

the original plaintiff claims such right apart from eviction. The plaintiff,

however, did not ask for cancellation of the sale deeds executed by

Gopal, Atul (defendant No.1) and also Hazarika Kaibarta (proforma

defendant No.5). During pendency of the suit the original plaintiff


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">RSA 50/2003                                                         Page 3 of 8</span>
 Sadhan died and in his place the present appellants were substituted

being his heirs and the right to sue having survived on them.



</p><p id="p_8">3.            The defendant Nos.1 to 4 contested the suit by filing their

respective written statements. While the defendant Nos.1 and 3 filed

the joint written statement, separate written statements were filed by

defendant Nos.2 and 4. The defendants have denied the claim of the

plaintiff for right, title and interest over the suit land. It has also been

contended that the defendant No.1 being the successor-in-interest of

Matia Nadial, who admittedly is the owner and possessor of the

Schedule-(a) land, rightly sold the land in favour of defendant No.3.

Similarly, it has also been pleaded that Gopal, the father of Atul, also

rightly sold 2 kathas of land in favour of defendant No.4. Further

pleaded case in the written statements is that Hazarika Kaibarta

(proforma defendant No.5) being another successor-in-interest of Matia

Nadial also rightly sold 2 kathas 18 lechas of land in favour of the

defendant No.2.

<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">4.            Based on the pleadings of the parties, the Trial Court

framed the following issues for determination:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">              (i)     Whether there is cause of action for the suit?

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">              (ii)    Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form?

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">              (iii)   Whether the suit is barred by law of limitation?

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">              (iv)    Whether the suit becomes bad for non-joinder of necessary parties?

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">              (v)     Whether the defendants have acquired any right, title and interest

                      over the suit land?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">              (vi)    Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get the decree as prayed for?
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">RSA 50/2003                                                                        Page 4 of 8</span>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">               (vii)   To what relief/reliefs the parties are entitled to?



</blockquote><p id="p_11">5.            The Trial Court based on the evidence adduced by the

parties dismissed the suit of the plaintiff by holding that the plaintiffs

could not prove the title and that based on Exts.-1, 2 and 3, copies of

the Jamabandi, no right, title and interest of the plaintiff could be

decreed. The Trial Court has also held that the defendant Nos.2, 3 and

4 have acquired right, title and interest by way of purchase. Being

aggrieved, the plaintiff preferred the aforesaid appeal, which has also

been dismissed by the first appellate Court. Hence the present appeal.



</p><p id="p_12">6.            The appeal was admitted for hearing vide order dated

18.05.2004 on the following substantial questions of law:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">              (i)     Whether the learned courts below has framed the

                      issues on the basis of the pleadings made by the

                      parties or not?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">              (ii)    Whether the land in possession of a co-pattadar/co-

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">                      owner is adverse to other co-pattadar/co-owner in

                      absence of clear pleading and evidence made in the

                      case?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">7.            I have heard Mr. P. Mahanta, learned counsel for the

appellants and Mr. P.J. Saikia as well as Mr. B.M. Choudhury, the

learned counsel appearing for the respondents.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">RSA 50/2003                                                                 Page 5 of 8</span>
</blockquote><p id="p_13"> 8.            Mr. Mahanta, the learned counsel referring to the judgments

and decrees passed by the Courts below has submitted that since the

plaintiff could prove the title in respect of half of the Schedule-(a) land

i.e. in respect of the land measuring 1 bigha 16½ lechas, by proving the

Jamabandi marked as Exts.-1, 2 and 3, the Courts below ought not to

have refused to pass the decree declaring right, title and interest of the

plaintiff and also for recovery of khas possession as the successor-in-

interest of Matia Nadial did not have any right to transfer the land in

favour of anyone, which belonged to Rameswar Bar Hazarika. It has

also been submitted that in the absence of any counter claim by the

defendants, the Courts below, in any case, ought not to have declared

right, title and interest of the defendants as has been declared while

answering the issue No.5.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">9.            On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the

respondents, supporting the judgments and decrees passed by the

Courts below, have submitted that though the plaintiff claimed right,

title and interest over 1 bigha 16½ lechas of land, he could not prove

the same. It has also been submitted that mere recording of the name

of Rameswar Bar Hazarika in the revenue record, which are marked as

Exts.-1, 2 and 3, would not confer title on Rameswar, in the absence of

proof of acquisition of title and hence the plaintiff's suit, who claimed to

be the successor-in-interest of Rameswar, has rightly been dismissed. It

has also been submitted that though while answering issue No.5, it has

been held that the defendants have right, title and interest in respect of

the suit land, no decree declaring their right, however, has been passed


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">RSA 50/2003                                                         Page 6 of 8</span>
 as is evident from the judgments and decrees passed by the Courts

below.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">10.           I have considered the submissions advanced by the learned

counsel for the parties and also perused the judgments and decrees

passed by both the Courts below.
</p>
<p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">11.           Though the plaintiff has claimed that his predecessor-in-

interest Rameswar Bar Hazarika was the owner of 1 bigha 16½ lechas

of land, which is half of the Schedule-(a) land, the plaintiff could not

prove the title deed. The plaintiff in support of the claim of right, title

and interest has proved only the Jamabandi i.e. the revenue records,

where the name of Rameswar Bar Hazarika was mutated in respect of

half of the Schedule-(a) land. The entry of the name of a person in the

revenue record cannot be the basis for declaration of the right, title and

interest, unless how he acquired the title is proved. The plaintiff has not

pleaded that how Rameswar Bar Hazarika has acquired title in respect

of half of the Schedule-(a) land, which admittedly belonged to Matia

Nadial. That being the position, the Courts below have rightly held that

the plaintiff could not prove right, title and interest in respect of the suit

land. It, however, appears from the finding recorded by the Trial Court

against issue No.5 that the learned Munsiff while discussing the said

evidence in respect of the said issue, has held that the defendants have

the right, title and interest. Be that as it may, no decree declaring the

right, title and interest of defendants has been passed, which in any

case cannot be passed in the absence of any counter claim.

</p><p id="p_20"> 12.           In view of the aforesaid discussion, I do not find any merit

in the appeal. Hence the appeal stands dismissed.
