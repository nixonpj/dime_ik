        IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA
                     AT CHANDIGARH

                                               FAO No.4898 of 2016 (O&amp;M)

Manjari Nehru Kaul, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">            The instant appeal has been preferred by the appellant against

the judgment and order dated 07.05.2014 vide which the petition filed under

Sections 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of the Hindu Adoption and <a href="/doc/902835/" id="a_1">Maintenance Act</a>,

1956 (in short 'the Act') was partly allowed and he was directed to pay

maintenance of Rs.2,000/- per month to respondent No.2 - Tinu @ Sonia.

</p><p id="p_2">2.          The facts pleaded by the respondents in the petition filed before

the Family Court, Sonipat are that marriage of respondent No.1 -Suman was

solemnised with Dharamvir (since deceased) son of the appellant on

28.06.2002 as per Hindu rites and ceremonies. Out of the said wedlock, one

daughter i.e. respondent No.2 Tinu @ Sonia was born on 21.07.2004. After

the death of the husband of respondent No.1, she was turned out of her

matrimonial home along with her minor daughter i.e. respondent No.2 and




                                     1 of 6

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> FAO No.4898 of 2016 (O&amp;M)                                               -2-</span>


since then she had been compelled to reside at her parental home in village

Dikadla.    It was further pleaded that as there was no moveable or

immoveable property in their name, hence, it was difficult for the

respondents to maintain themselves. It was also submitted that the late

husband of respondent No.1 and the father of respondent No.2 was a

member of Joint Hindu Family and co-owner in land measuring 4 acres

situated in District Sonipat, which was recorded in the name of appellant

herein and thus, both the respondents i.e. mother and daughter had a right in

the same, being coparceners. It was further submitted that the respondents,

herein, were liable to be, thus, maintained out of the income of the said land.

It was also alleged that the widow pension by the Government of Haryana,

which was disbursed in her favour, was never given by the appellant to her

and was illegally withheld by him.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.          The    appellant     refuted       the   averments   made   in    the

aforementioned petition by way of his written statement and denied the

same. He, in fact, pleaded that the ancestral property, which was stated to

be in his hands, was partitioned way back in the year 2000 and at that time,

his deceased son Dharamvir, husband of respondent No.1 and father of

respondent No.2 respectively had taken cash amounting to Rs.15 lakhs in

lieu of his share in the ancestral property from him and his other two sons.

It was submitted that cash amount so received had then been invested by

him for purchasing a private bus, which his deceased son Dharamvir would

ply. It was also pleaded that the deceased Dharamvir being HIV positive

was got treated by him and his other two sons by spending a huge amount of

money on his treatment. Further, on the death of his son Dharamvir, the

appellant repaid a debt of Rs.22 lakhs along with interest to the creditors,

which was standing against the name of Dharamvir. The appellant also

submitted that besides all this, he incurred expenditure on the education of

respondent No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.          From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were

framed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            1.     Whether the petitioners are entitled for maintenance of

                   Rs.20,000/- per month as alleged? OPP

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            2.     Relief.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">5.          Thereafter both the parties adduced evidence in support of their

case.     Respondent No.1 and her father namely Partap appeared in the

witness box as PW-1 and PW-2 respectively.             On the other hand, the

appellant deposed as RW-1 and reiterated his stand as taken in the written

statement. In his cross-examination, the appellant admitted that he owned

3Â½ acres of agricultural land and went on to depose that had the respondent

No.1-Suman not remarried, she would have got her share in the agricultural

land. Rattan Singh (RW-2) a relative of the appellant corroborated the

deposition made by the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.          After analysing the evidence on record, the trial Court held only

respondent No.2 - Tinu @ Sonia entitled to get maintenance and rejected

the right of respondent No.1 for maintenance from the appellant as she had

remarried. The trial Court directed the appellant to pay Rs.2,000/- per

month to respondent No.2 as maintenance.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.          We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the

evidence and other material available on record.

</p><p id="p_8">8.           It may be noticed that the learned counsel for the parties have

reiterated their submissions and stuck to their respective stand taken before

the trial Court.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.           While relying upon <a href="/doc/902835/" id="a_2">Section 20</a> of the Act, learned counsel for

the appellant submitted that in view of the provisions contained therein,

respondent No.2 would not be entitled to claim maintenance from the

appellant and a grave error had thus, been committed by the Court below in

awarding the said maintenance.
</p>
<p id="p_10">10.          On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents

vehemently argued that in view of the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/902835/" id="a_3">Section 21</a> of

the Act, respondent No.2 cannot be denied maintenance, which the

appellant being the paternal grandfather of respondent No.2 has rightly been

directed to pay.
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.          It would be relevant to reproduce Section 21 of Hindu

Adoption and <a href="/doc/902835/" id="a_4">Maintenance Act</a>, 1956, which is as follows:

of respondent No.2 would be liable to pay maintenance to his deceased son's
