      This MFA is filed under <a href="/doc/93665491/" id="a_1">section       173(1)</a> M.V.Act,
against the Judgment and Award dated:01/10/2009 passed

Claims Tribunal, Chikodi, awarding the compensation of
Rs.3,49,000/- with interest at the rate of 9% P.A. from the

       This appeal coming on for orders this day, the court.,
delivered the following:

                      JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      There is a delay of 86 days in filing the appeal.

Nevertheless, I have heard the learned Counsel for the

appellant on the merits of the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2.    This appeal is filed by North West Karnataka

Road Transport Corporation, Hubli, assailing the judgment

and award passed in MVC.1562/2008 dated 1.10.2009

passed by the MACT at Chikkodi.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      3.    The relevant facts of the case are, that on

15.9.2007 at about 12 noon, the deceased Basappa was

proceeding on Athani-Parthanahalli road in the bus bearing

No.KA.28/F-957 belonging to the appellant-Corporation.

The said bus was driven in a rash and negligent manner and

as a result, it dashed against a bridge and fell into a well

beside the bridge. Basappa sustained grievous injuries and

succumbed to the same. Contending that they had lost the

bread-earner of the family, his legal representatives being the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span>


widow and son filed a claim petition seeking compensation

on various heads.      The said petition was contested by the

appellant-Corporation.       On the basis of the evidence on

record, the Tribunal awarded compensation of Rs.3,49,000/-

with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of

petition till realization.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">       4.     Being     aggrieved   by   the   quantum     of

compensation awarded by the Tribunal, the Corporation has

preferred this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">       5.     I have heard the learned Counsel for the

appellant.   He submits that the Tribunal was not right in

assessing the notional monthly income of the deceased at

Rs.4,500/- per month on the basis that the deceased was

manufacturing pots and tiles, as in fact, no corroborative

evidence to that effect was produced. He therefore submitted

that the award of compensation on the head of loss of

dependency at Rs.3,24,000/- is on the higher side.


</p><p id="p_10">       6.     Having heard the learned Counsel for the

appellant and on perusal of the material on record, it is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>


noted that the deceased was 55 years old at the time of

death. His widow PW.1 has deposed that the deceased was

manufacturing pots and tiles and was earning monthly

income of Rs.15,000/-.       However, in the absence of there

being any evidence to corroborate the said fact, the Tribunal

has assessed the monthly income at Rs.4,500/-. The said

assessment cannot be held to be arbitrary or unreasonable,

having regard to the fact that the accident has occurred in

the year 2007.    Having regard to the date of accident even

with regard to an agricultural coolie the assessment of

notional income would be Rs.4,000/- per month. Since the

evidence that the deceased was manufacturing pots and tiles

has not been demolished by the Corporation, the assessment

of notional income at Rs.4,500/- is just and proper.   In fact,

having regard to the age of the deceased the correct

multiplier of 11 have to be applied.     Instead, the Tribunal

has applied the multiplier of only 9 which has in fact

reduced the compensation awardable by the Tribunal.

Moreover, award of compensation on the conventional heads

is also on the lower side.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               5</span><p id="p_11">


</p><p id="p_12">       8.    In that view of the matter, there is no merit in

this appeal. The appeal is dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_13">       The statutory amount to be transmitted to the

Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_14">       In view of the dismissal of the appeal, I.A.No.1/10 and

I.A.No.2/10 would not survive for consideration.
