dated 13.07.2016 (Annexure P-3) passed by respondent No.2- the Chief

Administrator, Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board whereby he

has held that the offer of the allotment of the plot to the petitioner in New

Mandi Narwana for a price of Rs.12.05 lacs is legal and valid and in

accordance with the earlier order dated 23.07.2013 of               the Chief

Administrator directing that the petitioner be considered for allotment of

plot at the reserve price.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             The petitioner is a proprietary firm and was carrying on

business in the Old Mandi, Narwana District Jind.
</p>
<p id="p_4">               The Executive Officer, Market Committee, Narwana (Jind)

through public notice dated 15.06.2009 invited applications for allotment of

shop/ plot from old licensees of category II (katcha artiyas) of the old

Mandi to be de-notified. The allotment was to be on            a reserve price

through draw of lots.        The petitioner applied for the same, but its

application was rejected on the ground that the firm was operating its

business from the first floor of the old grain market. It filed an appeal

there-against, which was dismissed by the Chief Administrator HSAMB

vide his order dated 15.12.2010 on the ground of limitation. The petitioner

preferred a revision petition before the Financial Commissioner,

Agriculture, Haryana, who           vide his order dated 09.06.2011, after

condoning the delay, remanded the case to the Chief Administrator with

directions to decide the same on merits. After the remand, the appeal was

heard by the Chief Administrator, HSAMB. The appeal was allowed vide

order dated 23.07.2013 and the petitioner was declared eligible for

considering his case for allotment of plot on reserve price.</p><pre id="pre_2">

</pre><p id="p_5">            The grievance of the petitioner is that instead of allotting the

plot to him on reserve price of Rs.6,80,000/-           which was charged from

similar licencees of the old Mandi who were allotted the plots in the year

2009 (when the petitioner was illegally held to be ineligible), the

respondents re-fixed the reserve price to be charged from it at Rs.12.05

lacs.   Respondent No.3 - the Administrator, Market Committee, Narwana

got a Memorandum of Offer (Annexure P-4) signed from the petitioner,

whereby, the petitioner offered to purchase the plot at the price of

Rs.12,05,000/- . Twenty five per cent of the price i.e., Rs.3,05,000/- was

paid . The balance along with interest was to be paid and the purchase

completed in accordance with the conditions in this Memorandum of Offer.

It is the case of the petitioner that it did not sign the Memorandum of Offer

and make the payment voluntarily, but it was done under coercion as

otherwise it would not have been given the plot. It was only after receipt of

25% of the refixed/ enhanced reserved price that the respondents allotted

the plot to the petitioner vide allotment letter dated 13.08.2014.          The

petitioner was, thereafter, offered possession of the plot on 27.08.2014.

</p><p id="p_6">            Aggrieved of the action of the respondents in allotting it the

plot at the price of Rs.12,05,000/-, whereas, the other allottees had been

allotted the same for a sum of Rs.6,80,000/-, the petitioner served a legal

notice dated 27.01.2015 (Annexure P-8) requesting the respondents to refix

the reserve price of the plot at Rs.6,80,000/-.      As there was no positive

response to the petitioner's request to refix the reserve price at

Rs.6,80,000/-, it preferred CWP No.21685 of 2015 seeking directions to

quash the Memorandum of Offer dated 13.06.2014 and for directing the

respondents to allot the plot at the reserve price of Rs.6,80,000/- in terms of

the order of the Chief Administrator dated 27.03.2013.          The said writ

petition was disposed of vide judgment and order dated 09.10.2015

observing that the petitioner ought to seek a clarification of the order dated

27.03.2013. In the event of the clarification being against the petitioner,

he was given liberty to challenge the same. The petitioner, thereafter, filed

the application for clarification of the order dated 27.03.2013, which has

been dismissed vide order dated 13.07.2016.(Annexure P-21). It has been

held that the allotment price as charged from the petitioner is legal and

valid and in accordance with the order dated 23.07.2013 passed by the

Chief Administrator.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             Assailing this order, Sh. Arun Bansal, Ld. Counsel for the

petitioner contended that the petitioner was entitled to allotment of plot on

reserve price as fixed by the Board at the time of inviting applications on

15.06.2009. He argued that the petitioner had initially been wrongly held

to be ineligible. Later, the said order was set aside and he was held entitled

to a plot at the reserve price. Other allottees who applied along with the

petitioner were allotted plots on 31.12.2010 for Rs.6,80,000/-, whereas, the

petitioner not only suffered delay of four years in the allotment solely

because of the fault of the respondents, but is being charged an enhanced

rate of Rs.12,05,000/-.        He relied on a decision of this Court in

CWP No.1314 of 2013 Ishwar Chand and another Vs. State of Haryana

and ors to contend that the reserve price would be the reserve/ control price

which would have been chargeable by the respondents at the time of

inviting applications and not the reserve price prevalent at the time of actual

allotment when initially the allotment had been illegally and arbitrarily

denied to it.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                Sh. Sandeep Moudgil, Ld. Counsel for the respondents on the

other hand contended that the judgment relied by the Ld. Counsel for the

petitioner is distinguishable. The petitioner did not suffer any loss as made

out by him. The petitioner, in fact, continued to carry on business from the

old mandi till 22.05.2013 when the old mandi was de-notified, which was

not so in the case relied on by the petitioner. He further argued that a plot

of the same size as allotted to the petitioner was sold in open auction in the

Mandi on 7.5.2015 for Rs.71.21 lacs, whereas, the petitioner has only been

charged the reserve price of Rs.12.05 lacs. He further argued that the price

charged from the petitioner is strictly as per the decision of the Board of

Directors of the respondent Board in its meeting held on 12.09.2011, where

it approved Supplementary Agenda Item No.3 as per which the reserve

price for old licencees whose cases were rejected by the allotment

committee but accepted by the Chief Administrator, were to be fixed by

adding 15% simple interest per annum to the original reserve price on

which the allotment was made to their counterparts.

</p><p id="p_9">                We have heard Ld. Counsel for the parties and perused the

record.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                The petitioner's application for allotment of a plot in the New

Grain Market was rejected on the ground that it had been operating the

business from the first floor of Old Grain Market which could not be

considered an independent premises, which was a condition for eligibility

for allotment.        Its   appeal there against was dismissed by the Chief

Administrator on 15.12.2010 on the ground of limitation. However, the

revisional authority vide its order dated 09.06.2011 condoned the delay and

remanded the case to the Chief Administrator for decision on merit.

Thereafter, the matter was reconsidered by the Chief Administrator. The

Chief Administrator noticed that the petitioner had been working as

category-II licencee for the last 22 years and had a good and consistent

turnover in the past. It was noticed that as per Rule 3 (1) (iv) of the

Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board (Sale of Immovable Property )

Rules 2000, there was a requirement to have an independent premises. But

the Board had passed a supplementary agenda No.3 dated 25.02.2009, vide

which,    certain clarifications were given with regard to independent

premises. Taking into considerations that clarification and the fact that in

certain similar cases operating from the first floor, relief had been given and

taking a liberal view the appeal of the petitioner was allowed and he was

held eligible for consideration of his case for allotment of plot on reserve

price.
</p>
<p id="p_11">             The relevant part of the order is extracted below:
</p>
<p id="p_12">                   "From the perusal of Rules 2000 and the resolution passed by the
            Board, it comes out that the allotment of plots on reserve price to the old
            licensees of category-II is made under the rehabilitation policy. It also
            comes out that the conditions, prescribed under the policy, are to check
            unscrupulous elements who may otherwise take undue benefit by getting
            allotment of plots on reserve price. The spirit of the rehabilitation policy
            is to grant the benefit to genuine and bonafide Commission Agents
            (Arthiyas). The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India is also of opinion, as
            expressed in <a href="/doc/1269367/" id="a_1">M/s Labha Ram and Sons &amp; ors. vs. State of Punjab &amp; ors</a>.,
            that a liberal view should be taken in allotment of plots on reserve price to
            old commission agents. In view of above said legal position and spirit of
            the rehabilitation policy, I am of the considered view that the purpose of

            eligibility criteria is to sift the bonafide old licensees of category-II from
            others.
</p><p id="p_13">                      In the present case, the appellant is working from last 22 yeas and
            have consistent and good turnover in the past. He has an independent
            premises in the old Grain Market which is to be denotified though on the
            first floor. My predecessor has already given the relief to such licencees
            operating their business from 1st floor in the same mandi.       Therefore, I
            am left with no option except to extend the same relief to the present
            appellant.
</p><p id="p_14">                      In view of the above said peculiar facts and circumstances of the
            case and keeping in view the orders passed by my predecessor, I am of the
            view that a liberal view may be taken in the present case as the appellant
            is a bonafide and genuine old licencee of category-II working in the old
            Grain Market which is to be denotified.
</p><p id="p_15">                      In sequel of the above said observations, the appellant is hereby
            declared as eligible for considering his case for allotment of plot on
            reserve price. The E.O.-cum-Secretary, Market Committee, Narwana is
            hereby directed to take the appropriate action immediately.        Therefore,
            the appeal is disposed of in above said terms."
</p>
<p id="p_16">

            Ld. Counsel for the petitioner had placed strong reliance on an

order dated 28.08.2015 passed on a clarification application moved in

CWP No.1314 of 2013 Ishwar Chand and another Vs. State of Haryana and

ors.
</p>
<p id="p_17">            In that case, the claim of the petitioner to a plot in the New

Grain Market Narwana was rejected on the ground that he was a Pucca

Arthiya. A Division Bench of this Court on perusal of the record found

this reason to be wholly untenable as the petitioner had, in fact, been issued

a licence as a Katcha Arhtiya. Hence, it allowed the writ petition vide its

judgment and order dated 19.08.2013 and held the petitioner therein to be

entitled to a plot on the reserve price/ control rate. In view of its finding

that the officials of the Board and the Market Committee had intentionally



                                   7 of 12
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">            ::: Downloaded on - 23-11-2017 01:34:17 :::</span>
                            CWP-21203-2016         [8]


withheld the record relating to the grant of licence and had put up a false

defence in the written statement knowing it to be false they were burdened

with costs of Rs.50,000/- to be paid by the official responsible. SLP against

this order was dismissed on 27.10.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_18">             As the respondents sought to charge the current reserve price

(as on the date of actual allotment ) for the plot instead of the reserve price

prevalent in 2009 (when the allotment of the plot was illegally denied) the

petitioner therein filed an application seeking clarification about the reserve

price.   The Court in its order dated 28.08.2015 clarified that as the

petitioner was denied a plot in the year 2009, the reference to the reserved/

control price in the order dated August 19, 2013 clearly and unambiguously

referred to the reserved/ control price as would have been charged from the

petitioner had the plot been allotted to him in the year 2009.

</p><p id="p_19">             This decision may not be of any help to the petitioner. As

rightly pointed out by the Ld. Counsel for the respondent, the facts of the

present case are different from that in Ishwar Chand's case. In the present

case, the petitioner continued to carry on business from his premises in the

old Mandi till it was de-notified on 22.05.2013. Such does not appear to be

the case in Ishwar Chand's case. In any case, the effect thereof vis- a -vis

the reserve price to be charged has not been adverted to in that case. Nor

has it been held and declared as a principle of law that in all such cases

where application is initially rejected and subsequently allowed in appeal/

revision the allotments should be made at the reserve price prevailing at the

time of inviting applications. The Division Bench also did not opine on the

validity of the price fixation mechanism approved by the Board of Directors

adding 15% simple interest per annum to the original reserve price on

which the allotment was made to their counterparts. In fact, it appears, that

this decision of the Board was not even placed before the Court nor any

argument addressed thereupon as there is no reference to this decision in

the judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_20">            Thus, the decision in Ishwar Chand's case has to be read as

being rendered in the fact situation obtaining therein, where the allotment

was illegally denied on wholly un-sustainable grounds and totally wrong

assertions contrary to the record were made before the High Court. It

cannot be read as disclosing a ratio of general application regarding

charging of reserve price prevailing at the time of inviting applications

from the old licencees in the old de-notified mandis in cases where after

initial rejection the claim is accepted later in appeal or revision and

thereafter allotment is made.
</p>
<p id="p_21">            A decision more fully applicable in the facts of this case is the

decision of a Division Bench in C.W.P. No.2206 of 2017 M/s. Ganesh

Trading Co. and Ors. Vs The State of Haryana and Ors. 2017(2) Law

Herald 1159.    In this case, the Court upheld re-fixation of reserve price

after charging of interest as per the decision dated 12.9.2011 of the Board

of Directors of the respondent Board. Thus, the ratio of this case is fully

attracted in present case.

trade from their shops in the old Grain Market, Julana, which had been in

existence since 1927.    Applications were invited for allotment of plots in

the new market from traders in the old Market. Initially, only 85 traders

were found eligible for allotment. The petitioners therein, were denied such

allotment on some technical grounds. They filed their individual appeals,

under Rule 11 of the Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board (Sale of

Immovable Property) Amendment Rules, 2008 which were allowed by

similar, but separate orders dated 28.7.2010 in which, it was held that they

were bona fide and genuine old licensees of Category-II working in the old

Grain Market, and that rejection of allotment of shops/ plots on reserve

price to them was not justified. The original 85 successful traders were

allotted plots at the price of Rs.22.50 lacs whereas in the case of the

petitioners an interest component of 15% per annum apart from certain

enhancement cost was added to the reserve price of Rs.22.50 lacs on

account of the time factor as their allotments were made only in the year

2012. The final reserve price for the petitioners came to Rs.29,53,125/-

which was then rounded off to Rs.30 lacs by the Board.

</p><p id="p_23">            The petitioners were in particular, aggrieved of the charging of

interest. The interest was charged in terms of the decision of the Board of

Directors vide its supplementary agenda item No.3 in its meeting held on

12.09.2011 as per which the reserve price for such old licencees whose

cases had been rejected by the allotment committee but accepted by the

Board or the State Government was to be re-fixed by adding 15% simple

interest per annum to the original reserve price on which allotment was

made to their counterparts.</p><pre id="pre_3">

Court observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "7. The rationale for imposition of interest on the subsequent allotment
            is contained in the Board's decision in the form of Annexure P-18,
            wherein it is noted that in the event of subsequent acceptance of certain
            applications for allotment originally rejected after the delay of many
            years, the Board/Market Committee stands to lose interest on its
            investment, having also to pay the interest on its borrowing and thereby
            suffers uncalled for financial loss, on account of which updation of the
            concessional price from time to time is inevitable. Consequently, the
            decision was taken to raise the same at the rate of 15% per annum as
            simple interest, as against the original practise of compound interest for
            the same amount. This rationale of including the interest factor in case of
            subsequent allotments is therefore, also logical and applicable in the
            facts of the present case. We say so because perusal of the relevant
            similar order dated 28.7.2010 passed by Respondent No.2 in relation to
            the separate appeals of various petitioners under Rule 11 of the Haryana
            State Agricultural Marketing Board (Sale of Immovable Property)
            Amendment Rules, 2008 read with Sections 18 and 43 (1) (2) and (vi) of
            the Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1961, which have been
            collectively filed as Annexure P-1 go to show that the various appeals
            were allowed in the 'peculiar facts and circumstances' of each case with
            the further observation ........... I am of the view that a liberal view may be
            taken in the present case............' There is no observation any where to the
            effect that non-allotment of the shop plots to the various appellants in
            each case was on account of any mala fide or extraneous reasons. It was
            essentially a question of interpretation of the Rules, and the Appellate
            Authority in its ultimate decision did away with the technical disabilities,
            which had come in the way of the concerned appellants for the purpose of
            the original allotments. In the absence of any visible mala fide or
            motivated approach, we do not find any justification to consider waiver of
            interest on the reserved price on account of delayed allotments in favour
            of the petitioners......"</blockquote><p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">            The Court accepted the            rationale of including the interest

factor in case of subsequent allotments as logical. For , otherwise, on

subsequent acceptance of applications for allotment which were originally

rejected, the Board/Market Committee would suffer uncalled for financial

loss as it would not only lose interest on its investment, but also have to

pay the interest on its borrowing. It was held that, in the absence of any

visible mala fide or motivated approach in the initial rejection, there was

no cause or justification for waiver of this interest .

</p><p id="p_27">             In the present case also, there is no finding that the initial

rejection of allotment was for mala fide or extraneous reasons. To the

contrary the Chief Administrator in its order dated 23.07.2013 extracted

earlier has noted that a liberal view has been taken in the case of the

petitioner in view of similar relief granted by his predecessor.

</p><p id="p_28">             Further, it has been admitted that the petitioner continued to

carry on business from the old premises till 22.05.2013 when the old mandi

was de-notified. It has also been pointed out that a plot of the same size has

been auctioned on 07.05.2015 for Rs.71.21 lacs, whereas, the petitioner has

been charged only Rs.12.05 lacs. The price has been re-fixed as per the

decision of the Board dated 12.09.2011, which has been upheld in the case

of M/s Ganesh (supra.)

             Thus, we find no illegality in the impugned order.
