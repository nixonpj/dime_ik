                   W.P.(C)No.8889 of 2016 I

                 -------------------------------------------

              Dated this the 1st day of June, 2016


                             JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">         The application submitted by the petitioner for issue

of a passport is not being considered by the authorities

under the <a href="/doc/229269/" id="a_1">Passports Act</a>, is the complaint of the petitioner.

It is alleged by the petitioner that his application for issue of

passport is withheld on the ground that there are criminal

cases against him. According to the petitioner, there are no

criminal cases against him and that therefore, there is no

justification for the delay in processing the application for

passport submitted by him.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           2.   The      learned         Government          Pleader, on

instructions, submits that there were nine criminal cases

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">WPC 8889/16                   2</span>




against the petitioner, of which one was transferred to

Devala Police Station in the State of Tamil Nadu. It was

pointed out by the learned Government Pleader that out of

the cases registered in the State, some have ended in

acquittal and the rest in conviction. It was also pointed out

by the learned Government Pleader that the petitioner was

imposed only fine in cases where he was convicted.         In

other words, according to the learned Government Pleader,

there are no cases pending against the petitioner in the

State. It is further pointed out by the learned Government

Pleader that even the case registered in the State of Tamil

Nadu against the petitioner is not pending now as the same

was referred after investigation.
</p>
<p id="p_3">         3. In the light of the submissions made by the

learned Government Pleader, I do not think that there will

be any impediment for the first respondent to consider the

application submitted by the petitioner for issue of the

passport.
</p>
<p id="p_4"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">WPC 8889/16                      3</span>




</p><p id="p_5">         In the result, the writ petition is disposed of directing

the first respondent to consider the application submitted

by the petitioner for issue of the passport, as expeditiously

as possible, within two weeks from the date of receipt of a

copy of this judgment.
