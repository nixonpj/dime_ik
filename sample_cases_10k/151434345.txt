      SUIT FOR PERPETUAL INJUNCTION AND MANDTORY 
            INJUNCTION AND FOR MESNE PROFITS


JUDGMENT:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.           In short facts are as under:­

             Plaintiffs   are   the   parents   of   defendant   No.   1   whereas 

defendant No. 2 is their daughter in law. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">             Plaintiff No. 1 is the absolute owner of the property bearing 



Suit No. 397/12.                                                            2 of  9
J.P. Yadav &amp; Another Vs. Pranesh Yadav &amp; Another
 No. 214, 30 feet Main Road, Sukhbir Nagar, Karala, Delhi and the said 

property was acquired by him from his self earnings and savings and thus 

is the self acquired property of the plaintiff No. 1.  The defendants were 

married on 14.07.1997 .   Defendant No. 1 was well earning having his 

own   Consultancy   firm   and   was   earning   a   handsome   income.     The 

defendants were allowed to reside in the back portion of the suit property 

without any rent purely on license basis.  The said area in their occupation 

is shown in red colour in the site plan annexed alongwith the plaint. The 

defendants, despite the largess of the plaintiffs had acted to the contrary 

and harassed the plaintiffs, creating disturbances in their peaceful living 

and causing mental discomfort/agony to them.  Obvious motive was that 

the plaintiffs should sell the property and give share to the defendants. 

Matter was also reported to the police on 25.02.08 and 12.10.09 without 

any   effect./change   in   behaviour   of   the   defendants.     Compelled   by   the 

illegal acts the plaintiffs had disowned the defendants vide public notice 

published   in   the   newspaper   Statesman   on   24.11.09.     Further   the 

defendants   had   also   acquired   an   alternate   accommodation   at   A­1/431, 

Suit No. 397/12.                                                                3 of  9

 Sector­6, Rohini and which they had rented out and deriving the rental 

income.   The   plaintiffs   also   served   a   legal   notice   dt.   05.06.2012 

terminating their license to live in the property of the plaintiffs and asking 

them to pay a sum of Rs.7,500/­ as occupation charges/damages/mesne 

profits . Despite the receipt of the legal notice defendants had failed to 

comply necessitating the filing of the present suit.  The relief for perpetual 

and mandatory injunction was sought for directing defendants to lift their 

articles,   goods   from   the   portion   in   their   occupation   and   handover   the 

peaceful and vacant possession of the property in their occupation to the 

plaintiffs alongwith a decree of mesne profit.        
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.             Summons for settlement of issues were directed to be served 

upon the defendants.   They were duly served on 20.12.2012.   However, 

the defendants opted not to appear and they were proceeded exparte on 

11.04.2013 by my Ld. Predecessor. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.             Plaintiff No. 1 as PW­1 had stepped into the witness box and 

tendered   his   evidence   by   way   of   affidavit   as   Ex.   PW1/1   in   lieu   of 

examination in chief.   He relied upon the photo copies of documents of 

Suit No. 397/12.                                                                  4 of  9

 ownership   of   property   No.   214,   30   feet,   Main   Road,   Sukhbir   Nagar, 

Karala,   Delhi   which   is   Ex.   PW1/A(OSR).     He   has   also   relied   upon 

original medical record of plaintiff No. 2 as Ex. PW1/1, original site plan 

as   Ex.   PW1/2,   attested   copy   of   complaint   lodged   with   the   police   on 

25.02.2008 and 12.10.09 as Ex. PW1/3 collectively, newspaper cutting of 

Statesman   dt.   24.11.2009   showing   the   public   notice   disowning   the 

defendants   as   Ex.PW1/4,   copy   of   legal   notice   dt.   05.06.2012   as   Ex. 

PW1/5. Thereafter, exparte evidence was closed.

</p><p id="p_5">4.            I have heard the Ld. counsel for the plaintiffs and perused the 

record. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.            In so far as the assertion of the plaintiff No. 1 that he is the 

owner  of the  suit   property,  the plaintiff  No.  1 has filed  the ownership 

documents i.e. Ex. PW1/A vide which the suit property was purchased by 

him.  The said documents are GPA, Agreement to Sell, Affidavit, Receipt 

and Will.   Another set of documents pertains to 50 sq. yards separately. 

Now no doubt the documents/part of the documents are un­registered but 

the same does not affect the outcome of the case as it is not a case of 

Suit No. 397/12.                                                                 5 of  9

 declaration or a suit where the question of title is involved.   It is a suit 

between a father (a licensor) and the son ­ (licensee) and the question of 

title is not relevant.  Needless to state that the defendants were inducted as 

a licensee by the plaintiffs and the question of licensee challenging the 

title   is   even     otherwise   barred/estopped   by   <a href="/doc/20238/" id="a_1">section   116</a>   of   the   Indian 

Evidence Act.  A ready reckoner or a handy reference can be made to 

the unreported judgment of Virender Kumar &amp; Anr. Vs. Jaswant Rai &amp; 

Anr (RSA no. 46/2011 decided on 10.3.2011 by Hon'ble Ms. Justice 

Indermeet Kaur).   
</p>
<p id="p_7">        In   the   said   judgment   it   has   been   categorically   held   "that   mere  
construction of superstructure cannot give rise to an interest in the land  
beneath   the   superstructure.     It   was   further   held   that   the   defendants  
objection that the plaintiffs should have filed a suit for possession and  
not a suit for mandatory injunction is also without any merits because a  
suit for mandatory injunction lies against a licensee after the license is  
revoked.       It was further held that however, a licence's possession is  
only permissive and he can be thrown out any time.  As per <a href="/doc/1890761/" id="a_2">Section 52</a>  
of the Indian Evidence Act, 1882, License is defined as under:­
"52.   "Licence"   defined­   Where   one   person   grants   to   another,   or   to   a  
definite number of other persons, a right to do, or continue to do, in or  


Suit No. 397/12.                                                                    6 of  9
J.P. Yadav &amp; Another Vs. Pranesh Yadav &amp; Another
 upon the immovable property of the grantor, something which would, in  
the absence of such right, be unlawful, and such right does not amount  
to   an   easement   or   an   interest   in   the   property,   the   right   is   called   a  
licence.     It   is   further   held   that   "but   relation   between   the   plaintiff   and  
defendant no. 1 is not of a licensor­licensee in its strict sense.   It was  
further   held   that   concept   of   permissive   possession   is   different   from  
concept of a licensor.  A child lives with his parents in the house of the  
parents  under a permissive  possession and not strictly as a licensee.  
No   rights   akin   to   the   rights   of   the   licensee   are   available   to   a   child.  
(Ramesh   Kumar   Handoo   Vs.   Binay   Kumar   Basu:   RSA   286/07   dated  
19.11.2007)".  
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.              Reverting to the fact of the termination of license. Plaintiffs 

have placed on record a public notice published in newspaper Statesman, 

the legal notice prior to filing of the suit which was duly served and also 

the  filing   of  the   case   manifestedly   display   and  makes   it  clear   that  the 

plaintiff wanted to get the suit property vacated.   The defendants   have 

also  not contested  the claim  of the plaintiffs/chosen  to remain  exparte. 

There is no reason to disbelieve the plaintiffs version or there is any other 

apparent lacunae in the case of the plaintiffs, which warrants me to take 

any   adverse   inference.     Plaintiffs   are   held   entitled   for   the   decree   of 

Suit No. 397/12.                                                                         7 of  9
J.P. Yadav &amp; Another Vs. Pranesh Yadav &amp; Another
 mandatory injunction thereby directing the defendants to vacate the suit 

property/property in their occupation.  
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.            Ld.   Counsel   for   the   plaintiff   submits   that   damages   @   Rs. 

7,500/­ per month be awarded. Qua that except the bald statement of PW­

1 no further evidence was led by the plaintiffs.  Mesne profit have to be 

proved by leading cogent evidence i.e. as to what such premises would 

fetch.  The said aspect could be proved by calling the record of the  lease 

deeds   from   the   Sub­Registrar   Office   or   through   the   deposition   of   any 

person who is well versed with property transactions i.e. either may be a 

property consultant or a real estate broker. Same has not been done. In my 

opinion in the interest of justice following order shall sub serve the ends 

of justice. Mesne profits are awarded @ Rs. 2,000/­ per month taking into 

account into the fact that area in possession of the defendant as shown in 

site plan Ex. PW­1/2 comprises of two rooms, kitchen, bath room, W.C. 

and one store and  also taking into consideration the fact that such a house 

normally/minimally   would be fetching rent @ Rs.1,000/­ per room per 

month.     I   may   also   note   that   while   adjudicating   mesne   profits   some 

Suit No. 397/12.                                                                 8 of  9
J.P. Yadav &amp; Another Vs. Pranesh Yadav &amp; Another
 amount of guesswork is permissible.  
</p>
<p id="p_10">8.             The result of the aforesaid is that the suit of the plaintiffs is 

decreed .   A decree of mandatory injunction is passed in favour of the 

plaintiffs   and   against   the   defendants   directing   them   to   vacate   the   suit 

property and handed over the peaceful vacant possession of the area as 

shown in the red colour in the site plan Ex. PW1/2 to the plaintiffs by 

removing their goods, articles from the said portion.  The defendants are 

liable to pay mesne profits @ Rs.2,000/­ per month since the filing of the 

suit till the handing over the possession. The decree of mesne profits shall 

be executed upon filing of court fees. 
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.             The suit of the plaintiff  is accordingly decreed  in terms as 

indicated   herein   above.     Decree   sheet   be   prepared   accordingly.File   be 

consigned to record room.
