                          SUNIL THOMAS, J.
                 -------------------------------------------
                     O. P. (Crl.) No. 453 of 2016
                 -------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 12th day of August, 2016

                            J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner moved the court below in MC No.52/2016

alleging commission of domestic violence. It was contended that,

the 2nd respondent and the petitioner, after their marriage resided

together at the house in Dhubri, Assam. Apprehending domestic

violence there, the wife sought relief before the court below. The

court below, after hearing the petitioner and being satisfied that

she was subjected to domestic violence, granted an ex-parte

interim protection order restraining the respondent from entering

into the house of the petitioner in House No.XI/508, Ratnakunj

Blue Hills Colony, Palakkad and from committing any sort of

physical violence till the disposal of the petition. The SHO, Kasba

Police Station was directed to assist in implementing the order.

</p><p id="p_2">      2.     This is assailed in this original petition, contending that

the court below proceeded on a wrong premise that since the

building regarding which the relief was sought fell beyond the

territorial jurisdiction of that court, it was not competent to pass

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">O. P. (Crl.) No. 453 of 2016          2</span>



an order. It was contended that, the court below committed a

further jurisdictional error by granting the relief in relation to the

building wherein the petitioner was residing, at present, which

was not a relief that was sought.           According to the learned

counsel for the petitioner, the court below proceeded on a wrong

premise regarding its powers.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       3.       The learned counsel for the petitioner drew my

attention to <a href="/doc/1886857/" id="a_1">Section 27(2)</a> of the Domestic Violence Act, which

enables a complete court to pass an order having its effect and

also enforceable beyond its jurisdiction. It was contended that

the court below went wrong in holding that, the court cannot pass

an order having an effect beyond its territorial jurisdiction.

</p><p id="p_4">       3.       In the light of the above legal position, I am satisfied

that though the court below found that there was a prima facie

case of commission of domestic violence, went wrong in not

exercising the powers conferred on it, especially in the

background of <a href="/doc/1886857/" id="a_2">Section 27(2)</a> of the Domestic Violence Act. This

jurisdictional error is liable to be corrected in this proceedings.

</p><p id="p_5">       4.       In the result, the original petition is allowed. The

impugned order to the extent of granting a restraint order in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">O. P. (Crl.) No. 453 of 2016     3</span>



relation to the building in Palakkad is set aside, while confirming

the prima facie finding of commission of Domestic violence. The

matter is remanded to the court below for passing fresh orders in

the light of what is stated above.
