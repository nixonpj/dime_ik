(By Sri V Raghunath, Adv. for
 Sri B G Rajashekar, Adv. for R-1)

      This Criminal Revision Petition is filed under
<a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_1">Section 397</a> Cr.P.C praying to set aside the judgment
and sentence dated 20.04.2006 passed by the XX
ACMM       and    XXII     ASCJ,     Bangalore    in
C.C.No.27067/2001, directing payment of fine of
Rs.22.00 lakhs and set aside the judgment passed
therein and set aside the judgment of confirmation
                            3


passed in Crl.A.No.1019/2006 on the file of the
Presiding Officer, F.T.C.-V, Bangalore dated 01.10.2009.

     This Criminal Revision Petition coming on for
hearing this day, the Court made the following:

                        ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     This revision petition is preferred by accused

Nos.2 and 3 challenging the judgment and order of

conviction dated 20.4.2006 passed by the XX ACMM

and XXII ASCJ, Bengaluru city in C.C.No.27067/2001

and confirmed by the judgment and order dated

1.10.2009 passed by the Fast Track (Sessions Judge)-V,

Bengaluru city in Crl.A.No.1019/2006.



</p><p id="p_2">     2. By its judgment and order, the trial Court

convicted accused Nos.1 to 4 for the offence punishable

under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_2">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act

and held that accused Nos.2 to 4 are jointly and

severally sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.22,00,000/-, in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             4</span>


default of payment of fine amount, each of them to

undergo simple imprisonment for a period of two years.

</p><p id="p_3">      Being aggrieved by the judgment and order of

conviction, accused Nos.2 and 3 have preferred appeal

before the first appellate Court. Even the first appellate

Court on perusing the materials in the said appeal,

dismissed the appeal confirming the judgment and

order of conviction passed by the trial Court.     Hence,

accused Nos.2 and 3 are before this Court in this

revision petition.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">      3. Brief facts of the case of the complainant are

that complainant is the bank and accused are the

customers of the complainant-bank. Accused Nos.2 to 4

are the Directors of accused No.1-Infospace Dot Com

Pvt. Ltd.,     Accused No.1 has availed the overdraft

facility of Rs.16,00,000/- on 27.6.2000 and even after
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            5</span>


several requests and reminders, it did not pay the loan

amount, on the other hand, issued cheque bearing

No.396719 for Rs.18,50,000/- dated 18.6.2001 drawn

on Punjab and Sindh Bank, J.C.Nagar, Bengaluru. The

complainant-Bank    has presented the     said   cheque

through its banker Vysya Bank Ltd., Kasturba Branch,

Bengaluru for encashment, which was returned on the

ground of insufficient funds with the endorsement dated

20.6.2001.   Complainant-Bank intimated the same to

the accused by way of demand notice to pay the cheque

amount. In spite of service of notice, the accused have

not paid the cheque amount, on the other hand,

accused Nos.2 to 4 have given untenable reply through

their advocate.   Thereafter, on 15.12.2000, accused

Nos.2 to 4 have given an undertaking to the bank

stating that they will clear all the dues of the accused

No.1 company by 30.4.2001.      Accused No.2 gave one
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             6</span>


more undertaking on 6.6.2000 stating that he will clear

all the dues payable to the bank. Since accused have

not paid the amount, complainant issued legal notice

and filed the private complaint before the trial Court. In

support   of   the   case   of   the   complainant,   one

Mr.Mohammed Samiulla was examined as P.W.1 and

documents Exs.P1 to P12 were got marked. On the side

of the defence one witness was examined as D.W.1 and

two documents were produced as per Exs.D1 and D2.

After considering the materials placed on record, the

trial Court held the accused persons guilty and

convicted them for the offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_3">Section 138</a> of

Negotiable Instruments Act. Being aggrieved by the said

order when appeal was preferred, it came to be

dismissed and the judgment and order of conviction

passed by the trial Court was confirmed by the first

appellate Court.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             7</span><p id="p_6">


</p><p id="p_7">     4. Heard the arguments of the learned counsel

appearing for the respondent No.1-complainant.          The

petitioners and their counsel are not present before the

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">     5. Learned counsel for the respondent No.1 -

complainant submitted that though as contended by the

petitioners-accused Nos.2 and 3 the complaint as

against them was dismissed by the learned Magistrate

and though the dismissal order was not recalled by the

learned Magistrate at any time, but in the subsequent

proceedings before the trial Court petitioners herein

have participated and have been examined under

<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_4">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C.          Hence, in view of this

subsequent    development       in   the   case   and   the

participation of the petitioners in the said proceedings,

the judgment and order of conviction passed by the trial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 8</span>


Court is binding on them.            Further, even the appeal

preferred   before      the     first   appellate     Court     in

Crl.A.No.1019/2006 came to be dismissed. The conduct

of the petitioners in approaching the first appellate

Court challenging the legality and correctness of the

judgment and order of the trial Court shows that they

have participated in the proceedings. Therefore, even if

the order of dismissal is not recalled by the trial Court,

the judgment and order of conviction passed by the trial

Court and confirmed by the first appellate Court are

binding on the petitioners and now they cannot contend

before   this   Court    that       proceedings     are   vitiated.

Accordingly, he has submitted that there is no merit in

the revision petition and the same is to be dismissed.



</p><p id="p_10">     6. I have perused the grounds urged in the

revision petition, judgment and order of conviction
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                9</span>


passed by the trial Court and confirmed by the first

appellate Court.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">     7.   Even     according       to   the   learned   counsel

appearing for the respondent No.1-complainant, it is an

admitted fact that the complaint as against revision

petitioners was dismissed by the trial Court. Further,

the order sheet dated 25.2.2005 secured from the trial

Court also shows that complaint as against accused

Nos.2 and 3 came to be dismissed and the matter was

posted for recording statement of accused No.4 under

<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_5">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C. The said dismissal order was not

recalled in the subsequent stage. Further, the entries in

the order sheet shows that the trial Court issued NBW

as against the petitioners herein. When the NBW was

executed, the petitioners filed application before the trial

Court under <a href="/doc/1437597/" id="a_6">Section 70(ii)</a> of the Cr.P.C. and the trial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                10</span>


Court has allowed the application and enlarged the

petitioners herein on bail.         Subsequently, petitioners

herein were also examined by the trial Court under

<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_7">Section 313</a>    of   Cr.P.C. and their statement was

recorded.   Ultimately, the trial Court held         accused

Nos.1 to 4 guilty of the offence punishable under

<a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_8">Section 138</a> of the N.I. Act.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">     8. As contended by the revision petitioners in the

grounds of the revision petition, at one stage when the

complaint came to be dismissed and it was not recalled

by the learned Magistrate, the learned Magistrate has

no jurisdiction to pass the order of conviction since the

subsequent proceedings are vitiated and they have no

legal sanctity at all.   In this connection, the revision

petitioners have also relied upon the decision rendered

in the case of Major General A.S. Gauraya and another
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                11</span>


Vs. S.N.Thakur and another reported in (1986) 2

Supreme Court Cases 709 wherein the Hon'ble Apex

Court has held that "after having passed an order of

dismissal,     the   Sub-divisional   Magistrate    becomes

functus officio and has no power to review or recall the

order     on   any    ground    whatsoever.        In   these

circumstances, therefore, the order even if there be one,

recalling order dismissing the complaint, was entirely

without jurisdiction.      That being the position, all

subsequent proceedings following upon recalling the

said order, would fall to the ground including the order

summoning the accused which must also be treated to

be a nullity and destitute of any legal effect."



</p><p id="p_15">        9. In view of the principle laid down by the Hon'ble

Apex Court and admittedly when even according to the

respondent No.1-complainant, the order of dismissal of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                            12</span>


the complaint was not recalled on a subsequent date, all

the subsequent proceedings as against the revision

petitioners are vitiated since there is no legal sanctity

for the subsequent orders after dismissal of the

complaint. This legal aspect is not looked into by the

trial Court as well as the first appellate Court.

Therefore, the judgment and order of conviction passed

by the trial Court and confirmed by the first appellate

Court so far as they relate to revision petitioners-

accused Nos.2 and 3 are illegal and they are not

sustainable in law.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">     10. Accordingly, revision petition is allowed. The

judgment and order of conviction passed by the trial

Court and confirmed by the first appellate Court, in so

far as they relate to revision petitioners herein, are

hereby set aside. It is for the respondent No.1-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                              13</span>


complainant, if so desired, to take appropriate steps, as

permissible under the law.
