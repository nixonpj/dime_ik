              W.P. 26280(W) of 2017

              Shampa Mandal
                    -vs-
         The State of West Bengal &amp; Ors.

       Mr. Biswaroop Bhattacharya,
       Mr. Golam Mohiuddin
                       ... for the Petitioner

       Mr. Bhaskar Prosad Vaisya,
       Mr. Nilay Baran Mondal
                        ... for the Council

       Ms. Sanghamitra Nandy,
       Mr. Sagnik Chatterjee
                       ... for the State

       Mr. Subir Sanyal,
       Mr. Ratul Biswas
                      ... for the Board


       The petitioner has filed the present writ petition for a direction upon the respondent</pre>

<p id="p_1">authority to award marks for the training qualification after incorporating the petitioner's

candidature in the panel and thereafter issue appointment letter for the Assistant Teacher of any

Primary School under Burdwan District.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       Mr. Bhattacharya, learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner, submits

that long back in the year 2004, the petitioner acquired the training certificate for

passing Primary Teachers' Training Examination, 2004 from the West Bengal

Board of Primary Education. Unfortunately, without adding marks for possessing

training certificate, the petitioner's status has been described as untrained

candidate. Hence, the present writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       Mr. Sanyal, learned Advocate appearing for the Board, submits that the petitioner

obtained training certificate for one year course and not for two years as per the guideline/norms
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                     2</span>

of NCTE.    Therefore, marks for training certificate of the petitioner cannot be added as the

petitioner failed to obtain two years training certificate.

</p><p id="p_4">       This submission of Mr. Sanyal is endorsed by Ms. Nandy, learned Advocate appearing for

the State respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       Mr. Bhattacharya further emphasizes on the point that in the year 2004, it is for

requirement of one year training certificate and not the requirement of two years training

certificate as has been projected by Mr. Sanyal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       Considering the submissions as advanced by the learned Advocates for the parties and

after perusing the records, I direct the petitioner to submit a representation thereby ventilating

his grievances before the respondent no. 3, the Secretary, West Bengal Board of Primary

Education, within a period of ten days from the date. The respondent no. 3 after receiving such

representation will consider and take a decision in accordance with existing law within two weeks

thereafter and afterthat communicate the decision to the petitioner within one week.

</p><p id="p_7">       With this direction, this writ petition is disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       Needless to mention that I have not gone into the merits of this case, all points are kept

open to be independently decided by the respondent no. 3 in accordance with law at time of

taking decision.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       Since this writ petition is disposed of without calling for affidavits, all allegations made in

this writ petition are not deemed to have been admitted.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       However, there will be no order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_11">       Urgent certified photostat copy of this order, if applied for, shall be given to the parties as

expeditiously as possible on compliance of all necessary formalities.
