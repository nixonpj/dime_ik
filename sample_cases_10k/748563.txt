ACT:
    The Kerala (Surcharge on <a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_1">Taxes) Act</a> 1957--<a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_2">Section 3-Levy</a>
of  surcharge  on Sales Tax--Society  composed	of  Cardamom
growers-Whether	 liable for levy of Surcharge in respect  of
sales effected on behalf of members of society.



HEADNOTE:
    The appellant--assesse is a Society registered under the
<a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_3">Societies Registration Act</a>. Its members are Cardamom growers
in the State of Kerala. The Society conducts the business as
an auctioneer under a licence issued to it under the  Carda-
mom  Act (Act 42 of 1965) read with the Cardamom  (Licensing
and  Marketing) Rules, 1977, one of the Conditions  of	this
licence being that as an auctioneer it shall not charge more
than  one  percent of the sale price as commission  for	 the
services rendered by it. It is common ground that the socie-
ty  has	 obtained the relevant licence	and  the  individual
members/growers of Cardamom had no such licence. The mode of
the  business was that planters left their produce with	 the
Society and the Society after mixing the produce of all	 the
growers,  put the same to auction. The Society collected  1%
as  commission	out of the sale proceeds from  each  of	 the
planters.  Besides  cardamom, the Society sold	other  goods
also.
    The Kerala General Sales Tax Act 1963 imposes sales	 tax
on every dealer whose total turnover for any year exceeds  a
specified sum which differed from year to year. In 1957	 the
Kerala	Legislature  introduced a surcharge  on	 sales	tax.
Section	 3  of the Kerala Surcharge on taxes Act  1957	pre-
scribes that the tax payable under the Kerala General  Sales
Tax Act 1963, shall, in the case of a dealer whose  turnover
exceeds Rs.30,000 a year, be increased by a surcharge at the
rate of 5% of the tax payable for that year. The  provisions
of the Kerala General Sales Tax Act were made applicable  to
the levy and collection of the said surcharge. Kerala Act 40
of  1976  stepped up the .rate of surcharge.  The  important
feature	 of the latter Act is that unlike sales	 tax,  which
the dealer was entitled to get reimbursed from the purchaser
of  the goods sold by him, the surcharge had to be borne  by
the dealer himself, as
720
Sub-Section (2) of <a href="/doc/2973/" id="a_4">Section 3</a> of the Surcharge Act prohibited
the  dealer  from collecting the surcharge payable  by	him.
Further the dealer might be liable for sales tax at  differ-
ent rates on the turnover of the different goods dealt	with
by him, he was to pay surcharge calculated on the amount  of
the  sales tax payable by him in respect of his total  deal-
ings throughout the year.
    The	 assessee's  contention was that  the  Society	sold
goods only in its capacity as a commission agent for various
principals  and that on the general principle of agency,  an
agent like the assessee could be liable to surcharge only to
the  same  extent as the principal whom it  represented.  On
this plea, it could not be made liable for any surcharge  in
respect of the sales effected by it on behalf of the princi-
pals  whose  sales through the Society did  not	 exceed	 the
limits set out in Sec. 3(1) of the <a href="/doc/488279/" id="a_5">Surcharge Act</a>.
    The	 Tribunal had accepted the above contention  of	 the
appellant  in  the appeals against the	assessment  for	 the
assessment  years 1967-68 to 1969-70. The sales Tax  assess-
ments  of the appellant for the assessment years 1973-74  to
1976-77	 were completed by the Sales Tax  Officer  following
the aforesaid order of the Tribunal. These assessments	were
set aside by the Dy. Commissioner of Sales Tax who took	 the
view  that  the Society was liable to pay surcharge  on	 its
aggregate  turnover  in each of the  assessment	 years.	 The
appellant-assessee preferred appeals to the Appellate Tribu-
nal  against  the  orders of the  Deputy  Commissioner.	 The
Tribunal allowed the appeals following its order relating to
the  earlier assessment years. It accordingly set aside	 the
orders of the Dy. Commissioner and restored the	 assessments
made  by  the  Sales Tax Officer for  the  assessment  years
1973-74 to 1976-77. The Department moved revision  petitions
before	the  High Court against the order of  the  Appellate
Tribunal.  The High Court accepted the revision of  the	 De-
partment  and  set aside the order of  the  Tribunal.  Hence
these appeals by the assessee.
    It was contended by the appellant (i) that the liability
of  an agent is co-extensive with that of principal and	 its
liability cannot be higher than that of principal; (ii) that
it is contrary to the principle underlying rule 9(k) of	 the
Kerala	General	 Sales Tax Act whereunder  the	turnover  of
sales  or  purchases made by a dealer through his  agent  in
respect of which tax has been paid by the agent, is excluded
from  his taxable turnover and (iii) that the  assessee	 has
been placed in a financial predicament in that it has to pay
he surcharge from out of the meagre commission of 1% limited
by the statute.
721
Dismissing the appeals, this Court,
    HELD: <a href="/doc/488279/" id="a_6">The Surcharge Act</a> does not envisage a fresh deter-
mination  of the assessee's turnover at all.  It  prescribes
nothing	 more than a simple arithmetical calculation of	 the
prescribed percentage on the sales-tax determined as payable
by the assessee for that year. It does not permit the compu-
tation of the surcharge, for whatever reason, on a part only
of  the	 tax determined as payable by the assessee  for	 the
year in question. It does not contemplate any dissection  of
the turnover into transactions on behalf of various  princi-
pals  by  reference  to their individual  liability  to	 pay
either	sales  tax or surcharge. The  contentions  urged  on
behalf of the petitioner create a number of difficulties and
or about a very simple procedure, evolved by the statute  to
meet the present situation- It brought the Commission  agent
within	the  definition of a dealer and made  his  aggregate
turnover  liable  to tax. But it provided at the  same	time
that the turnover so included and taxed in the hands of	 the
agent should he excluded from the turnover of the principal,
where he is separately assessed. [726C-D, 727E-F, 728C]
    Rule  9(k)	confers an exemption not on  the  Commission
agent  but on the Principal and does not help the  assessee.
[728D]
    The	 rate  of  tax on any type of  goods  being  uniform
irrespective of the turnover, the turnover in regard to that
item  will  get assessed only at one place:  either  in	 the
hands of the principal or in the hands of the agent but	 not
both. [728D]
    A  suggestion was mooted before us that the hardship  to
the  assessee  on this account is so substantial  that	this
requirement should be held to he an unreasonable restriction
violating  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_7">Article  19.</a> This is a new  contention  involving
investigation into facts which this Court is not inclined to
permit	the  assessee  to raise here  for  the	first  time.

    RANGANATHAN,  J.  M/s. Cardamom  Planters'	Association,
Bodinayakanur,	(hereinafter referred to as  'the  society')

liability  to the levy of surcharge under the  Kerala  (Sur-
charge on <a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_8">Taxes) Act</a>, 1957, as amended in 1970.
    The	 Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963,  imposes  sales
tax  on every dealer whose total turnover for any  year	 ex-
ceeds  a specific sum. The sum prescribed was initially	 Rs.
10,000	but was gradually stepped up to Rs.20,000  in  1971,
Rs.25,000  in  1976, Rs.35,000 in 1980, Rs.50,000  in  1981,
Rs.75,000  in  1982 and Rs.1 lakh in 1984.  The	 expressions
'dealer',  'taxable turnover', 'total turnover'	 and  'turn-
over'  are  defined in <a href="/doc/1710379/" id="a_9">section 2</a> of the	 Act.  The  relevant

<p id="p_6">    We	may note here two important features of	 the  latter
Act. the first is that, unlike sales tax which the dealer is
entitled  to get reimbursed from the purchaser of the  goods
sold  by  him, the surcharge has to be borne by	 the  dealer
himself,  for sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/2973/" id="a_16">section 3</a> of the  Surcharge
Act  prohibits	the  dealer from  collecting  the  surcharge
payable by him under sub-section (1) on pain of	 prosecution
under  sub-section  (3). The second is that while  a  dealer
might  be  liable  to sales tax at different  rates  on	 the
turnover  of the different goods dealt in by him, he has  to
pay  a surcharge calculated on the amount of the  sales	 tax
payable	 by him in respect of his total dealings  throughout
the year.

1965), read with the Cardamom (Licensing &amp; Marketing) Rules,
1977, no person is entitled to carry on business as auction-
eer,  dealer  or exporter of cardamom except  under  and  in
accordance with the terms and conditions of a licence issued
under the Act and Rules. One of the conditions of the  grant
of  licence to a person as an auctioneer is that  he  "shall
not  charge  more  than one per cent of the  sale  price  as
commission  for the services rendered by him". It is  common
ground that it is the society that has obtained the relevant
licence	 for this purpose and that the	individual  cardamom
growers who are members of the society have no such licence.
    The	 society conducts weekly cardamom auction  sales  at
two  places,  Santhanpara and  Bodinayakanur.  The  planters
leave their produce with the society. The produce of all the
growers is mixed together and put to auction. It is open  to
the  planters to be present at the auction. If	any  planter
desires	 to  sell  at a specific price he  can	express	 his
opinion in advance to the association. If he wants to  with-
draw  his  lot	put up for sale he could  do  so.  Stitching
charges and miscellaneous
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">725</span>
charges are to be paid to the society. The society  collects
1%  as commission out of the sale proceeds from each of	 the
planters.  Besides sale of cardamom, which  constitutes	 the
major  part of its turnover, the society also  sells  other-
goods such as gunnies, pesticides, sprayers, manure and	 the
like.
</p><p id="p_8">    It	is  contended on behalf of the appellants  that	 the
society has sold the goods only in its capacity as a commis-
sion  agent for various principals and that, on the  general
principles  of	agency, an agent like the  assessee  can  be
liable to surcharge only to the same extent as the principal
whom  it represents. Hence it cannot be made liable for	 any
surcharge in respect of the sales effect by it on behalf  of
principals whose sales through the society do not exceed the
limits set out in<a href="/doc/1599994/" id="a_19"> s. 3(1)</a> of the Surcharge Act.
    The above contention was accepted by the Tribunal in the
appeals against the assessments made on the society for	 the
assessment  years 1967-68 to 1969-70. The sales tax  assess-
ments  of the society for 1973-74 to 1976-77 were  completed
by  the	 'Sales Tax Officer on the basis of  the  Tribunal's
order.	These  assessments were, however, set aside  by	 the
Deputy Commissioner of Sales tax who was of the opinion that
the  society  was liable to pay surcharge on  its  aggregate
turnover in each of these years and he directed accordingly.
The  assessee  preferred appeals to the	 Appellate  Tribunal
from  the  orders of the Deputy Commissioner.  The  Tribunal
allowed	 the appeals by a common order dated  3rd  November,
1982  following its order for the earlier assessment  years.
It  set	 aside the revisional orders passed  by	 the  Deputy
Commissioner and restored the assessments made by the  Sales
Tax Officer for the assessment years 1973-74 to 1976-77. The
High Court, on revision by the Department, has set aside the
orders of the Tribunal and restored the orders of the Deputy
Commissioner. Hence these appeals.
</p><p id="p_9">    We	are unable to see any flaw in the High Court's	rea-
soning. The present assessee is clearly a dealer within	 the
meaning	 of the statute, particularly in view of the  inclu-
sive part of the definition contained in
clause (c). This is also the finding of the Tribunal and  is
also  admitted by the assessee. Likewise, the provisions  of
S.  5  of the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_20">Sales Tax Act</a> and<a href="/doc/2973/" id="a_21"> S. 3</a> of the  Surcharge	Act,
read  with the definitions of the words 'turnover'  'taxable
turnover'  and	'total turnover', leave no  doubt  that	 the
assessee's  taxable turnover has to be determined by  taking
the aggregate price of all the goods sold by it. There is no
statutory warrant for breaking-up the sales turnover of	 the
assessee by reference to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">726</span>
the  turnover  of the principals on whose behalf  it  deals.
Also,  a logical corollary of the assessee's argument  would
be that, even in respect of tax, the society can be assessed
to  sales  tax only on the aggregate  turnover	relating  to
those of its principals who are liable to tax under  <a href="/doc/323449/" id="a_22">section
5</a>  of the Act. The High Court has rightly pointed  out	that
the  assessee  had not claimed, for purposes of	 sales	tax,
that  the  turnover of goods dealt with by it on  behalf  of
principals  who	 did not have a taxable turnover  should  be
excluded. If this be so, the High Court observes rightly, it
is difficult to see on what principle the assessee can seek,
in  the matter of surcharge, the exclusion from its  taxable
turnover,  of the turnover of principals who would not	have
been subjected to a surcharge if they had directly sold	 the
goods  entrusted by them to the assessee for sale.  This  is
particularly so because the <a href="/doc/488279/" id="a_23">Surcharge Act</a> does not  envisage
a fresh determination of the assessee's turnover at all.  It
prescribes nothing more than a simple arithmetical  calcula-
tion  of the prescribed percentage on the sales	 tax  deter-
mined as payable by the assessee for that year. There can be
no doubt about this figure. The statute does not permit	 the
computation of the surcharge, for whatever reason, on a part
only  of the tax determined as payable by the  assessee	 for
the year in question.
</p><p id="p_10">    On	behalf of the assessee, objection has been taken  to
the  levy  of surcharge in the manner in which it  has	been
levied on three grounds:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">	      1.  The general principle of law is  that	 the
	      liability	 of  an agent is  co-extensive	with
	      that of the principal and his liability to tax
	      or  surcharge, in respect of transactions	 put
	      through  on behalf of a principal,  cannot  be
	      higher  than  that which the  principal  would
	      have himself incurred had he directly sold the
	      goods;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">		     2.	 It  is contrary  to  the  principle
	      underlying  rule 9(k) of the Kerala Sales	 Tax
	      Rules  under which "the turnover of  sales  or
	      purchases	 made by a dealer through his  agent
	      in  respect of which tax has been paid by	 the
	      agent" is excluded from his taxable turnover;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">		     3.	 The assessee has been placed  in  a
	      financial	 predicament because .all  that	 the
	      assessee	can  get  out of the  sales  is	 the
	      commission which cannot exceed 1% of the turn-
	      over and, since the statute has prohibited  it
	      from collecting any part of the surcharge from
	      the purchasers or the principals the  society,
	      has to meet the surcharge liability out of its
	      meagre commission earnings.</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">	      We are unable to see how these contentions can
	      help the assessee
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">727</span>
to overcome the surcharge levy. The general principle of the
law  of	 agency, as rightly pointed out by the	High  Court,
cannot prevail in the face of the statutory provisions.	 The
assessee's contention, upheld by the Tribunal in its earlier
order, is this:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">	      "	 .....	an agent is as many dealer as he has
	      principals  ... an agent can be  assessed	 ...
	      only on the aggregate of the turnover relating
	      to  principals  who are liable  to  tax  under
	      <a href="/doc/323449/" id="a_24">section 5</a> and surcharge can likewise be levied
	      only in respect of the turnover of the princi-
	      pals  where  total turnover is not  less	than
	      Rs.30,000."
</blockquote><p id="p_12">This will also mean that, after the amendment of<a href="/doc/2973/" id="a_25"> s. 3</a> of the
Surcharge  Act	in 1976 that the agent will be liable  to  a
surcharge  at  8% in respect of the turnover  on  behalf  of
principals whose total turnover exceeds Rs. 10 lakhs, at  5%
in  respect of the turnover on behalf of  principals  having
turnover  of between Rs.1 lakh and Rs. I0 lakhs and no	sur-
charge	in respect of the turnover on behalf  of  principals
with turnovers of less than Rs. 1 lakh. This may be  equita-
ble  but  it  clearly amounts to running a  coach  and	pair
through	 the statutory provisions. As already  pointed	out,
these  provisions  clearly  treat a commission	agent  as  a
dealer and make him liable to sales tax as well as surcharge
in respect of his entire turnover. <a href="/doc/488279/" id="a_26">The Act</a> does not  contem-
plate  any dissection of this turnover into transactions  on
behalf of various principals by reference to their individu-
al liability to pay either sales tax or surcharge.
    The question of statutory interpretation apart, it	will
easily	be  seen that the assessee's  contention,  which  is
equally	 applicable to the levy of both sales tax  and	sur-
charge,	 would make the whole Act unworkable.  A  commission
agent will be dealing on behalf of hundreds of	constituents
and each of his constituents may be dealing not only through
him but also through several other agents. The	transactions
may not be confined to the territories of one State and	 may
be  spread over the entire Indian sub-continent.  The  sales
through different agents may be of different goods  attract-
ing  liability to tax at different rates. It may be  that  a
principal  whose sales through one commission agent may	 not
come  upto  the limits of turnover for levy of tax  or	sur-
charge	may have been dealing through other agents  and,  if
assessed  directly,  may  have a  turnover  exceeding  those
limits.	 In  this state of affairs, it	will  be  absolutely
impracticable,	if not impossible, for a Sales	Tax  Officer
having jurisdiction over one particular commission agent  to
make his sales tax assessment on the basis suggested
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">728</span>
by the assessee. That would require the collection of  data,
in  the assessment of every commission agent, regarding	 the
entire sales turnover of each of his constituents who may or
may not be assessed by the officer assessing the  particular
commission  agent.  The assessment order on  the  commission
agent  would then have to be split up, as it were ,  into  a
number	of parts each containing the determination of  turn-
over, tax and surcharge qua each of the constituents.  These
determinations require exercises which cannot be practically
undertaken  by an officer assessing a commission  agent	 but
can easily be undertaken by the different officers assessing
the  principals.  That	is why the statute  evolved  a	very
simple	procedure  to  meet the situation.  It	brought	 the
commission agent within the definition of a dealer and	made
his aggregate turnover liable to tax. But it provided at the
same  time  that the turnover so included and taxed  in	 the
hands  of the agent should be excluded from the turnover  of
the principal, where he is separately assessed. This is rule
9(k).  Rule 9(k) confers an exemption not on the  commission
agent  but on the principal and does not help the  assessee.
So  far as sales tax is concerned, this rule  provides	com-
plete protection against double taxation. The rate of tax on
any  type of goods being uniform irrespective of  the  turn-
over, the turnover in regard to that item will get  assessed
only  at one place: either in the hands of the principal  or
in the hands of the agent but not both. The treatment of the
commission  agent as a dealer no doubt means that  an  agent
will be taxed where his turnover exceeds the relevant limits
even though some or all the principals who sold through	 him
may have turnovers below those limits. But he is not  really
affected as he can collect the sales tax from the purchasers
and thus reimburse himself.
</p><p id="p_13">     The  difficulty that has arisen in regard to  the	sur-
charge	stems  principally  from the  requirement  that	 the
society has to pay it out of its funds and cannot  reimburse
itself	either	from  its vendees or  its  principals.	This
difficulty has been further accentuated by the fact that, in
regard	to  cardamom, its earnings are limited	to  a  small
commission which cannot be varied by it at its desire. These
considerations cannot however justify a different  interpre-
tation as the statutory provisions are clear.
</p><p id="p_14">     A suggestion was mooted before us that the hardship  to
the  assessee  on this account is so substantial  that	this
requirement should be held to be an unreasonable restriction
violating  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_27">article  19.</a> This is a new  contention  involving
investigation into facts which we are not inclined to permit
the assessee  raise here for the first time. We may,  howev-
er, mention that during, the hearing of these appeals, we
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">729</span>
adjourned  the	appeals to enable the assessee to  move	 the
State in this behalf but we were told that its efforts	were
unsuccessful.  We need hardly say that the assessee will  be
at  liberty to pursue the matter, put forward its  difficul-
ties  and  seek to persuade the State Government  to  either
reduce or dispense with the surcharge in regard to  cardamom
sales  or to sanction an increase in the rate of  commission
chargeable by the assessee on its cardamom sales and,  fail-
ing such efforts, to challenge the validity of the levy	 for
the future, if so advised, in appropriate proceedings.
    In	the circumstances, we affirm the view taken  by	 the
High  Court and dismiss these appeals. We, however, make  no
order as to costs.
