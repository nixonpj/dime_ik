    dated 2.4.2016 as also the wrongful awarding of two marks to the respondent

<p id="p_6">    3.              The   respondent   no.1   had   published   an   advertisement   inviting 

    applications   for   appointment   on   the   posts   of   Clerk.   Out   of   seven   posts 
       


    earmarked  for the Open category,  two posts were reserved for women,  one 
    



    for ex-serviceman  and two  for the physically challenged. The petitioner and 

    the respondent No.4 applied for the post meant for the Open category along 





    with   several   other   candidates.   The   candidates   were   required   to   solve   an 

    answer paper and the result of the examination was declared on 12.1.2016.

    objection about the answer to Question No. 60. According to the respondent 

    no.4,he had answered Question No.60 correctly. The Committee decided the 

    objection in favour of the respondent no.4   and held that the answers of the

    view of the said decision, both the petitioner and the respondent no.4 secured 

    equal   marks     ie,   170   marks.   However,   the   respondent   no.1   selected   the 




                                                                   
    respondent   no.4   for     appointment   on   the   post   of   Clerk   as   the   age   of   the 

    respondent no.4   was more than the age of the petitioner. According to the 




                                                       
    petitioner,   the action on the  part of the  respondent no.1 of  awarding two 

    additional   marks   to   the   respondent   no.4   is   bad   in   law     and   the   order   of 
                                  
    selection-appointment of the   respondent no.4 is liable to be set aside. The 
                                 
    petitioner   seeks   a   direction   against   the   respondent   no.1   to   appoint   the 

    petitioner on the post of Clerk.

    submitted that the Committee had rightly held initially, by  comparing with the 
    



    Key Answers-Model Answers that the answer of the petitioner to Question No.

    60  was correct, but  the Committee erroneously held after the objection was 





    raised by the respondent no.4 that the answer of the  respondent no. 4 to the 

    said  question, was also correct. It is  stated that both the answers could not 





    have   been   correct   and   the   answer   of   the   petitioner   was   the   only   correct 

    answer. It is submitted that the Committee, however, took an unusual stand  by 

    awarding   marks   to   the   petitioner   and   the   respondent   no.4   for   different 

    answers,   for   the   same   question.  The   learned   counsel  submitted  that  in   the 

    circumstances of the case, a direction would be necessary to the respondent

    has also supported the decision of the Committee. It is   stated that since the 
                                 
    respondent no.4 had also answered  Question No. 60 correctly, the Committee 

    has taken a right decision of awarding two additional marks to the respondent 

    no.4.   It   is   submitted   that   since   the   respondent     no.4   was   older   than   the 
       


    petitioner, the  respondent no.1 has  rightly appointed the  respondent no.4, on 
    



    the post of Clerk.

    petitioner had rightly answered the question by choosing option No.(C) and

    since the error made by the Committee is manifest,  it would be necessary to 

    hold that the Committee has committed a serious error in holding that the 

    answer of the respondent no.4 is correct. The Committee was not justified in 
       


    holding that the answer of the respondent no.4 was the correct answer.  It is 
    



    also necessary to note from a perusal of the options to the other answers that 

    in most of the questions, the options include the words that begin with small 





    letters and not capital letters. Like Question No.59 which reads, "We  are not 

    so poor  as .............  A) him B) they  C) them D) their - has    all the options 





    starting  with small letters and not capital letters. So also  the next question, 

    ie,  Question No.61 reads thus :-

    relevant question with which  we are concerned  ie, Question No. 60  and the 

    subsequent question that, mostly in all the questions, the options start with 




                                                                      
    small   letters   and   not   capital   letters.   We   find   that   in   only   very   few   of   the 

    questions, the options start with capital letters. This is done only with a view 




                                                         
    to  confuse  the  candidates while testing their knowledge of grammar.  Be that 

    as it may,  in any  case, the answer to Question No.60 cannot start with capital 
                                   
    letters as answered by the respondent no.4. The Committee has committed an 
                                  
    error in holding that the answers of the petitioner as well as the respondent 

    no.4, though they were different, were correct. In the circumstances of the 

    case, the Committee was not justified in awarding  two additional marks to the 
       


    respondent no.4.
