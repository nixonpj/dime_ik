                              2

       THIS CRIMINAL PETITION IS FILED UNDER SECTION
439 OF CR.P.C. SEEKING TO ENLARGE THE PETITIONERS
ON      BAIL WHO ARE THE ACCUSED NOS.1 &amp; 2 IN
S.C.NO.52/2013 ON THE FILE OF PRL. DIST. &amp; SESSIONS
JUDGE, GADAG, IN CRIME NO.34/2013 FOR THE
OFFENCES PUNISHABLE UNDER SECTION 302 R/W 34 OF
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">I.P.C</a>.

    THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS DAY,
THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                         ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     Heard learned counsel for the petitioners. Perused the

records.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2. The brief facts of case on hand are that a person by

name Gurushanthappa has lodged a complaint that his

sister by name Basamma was murdered by petitioners

herein with the help of one Smt. Rajeshwari (accused No.3 is

already released on bail). It is the case of prosecution that

on 13.03.2013 the complainant's aunt by name Saroja

informed the complainant over phone that Basamma had

been murdered.    The complainant came to Naragund and

found his sister dead. On enquiry, the accused - Rajeshwari
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3</span>

informed the complainant that her husband complainant

had gone on work to Bagalkot.         Rajeshwari and Basamma

were   asleep   on   the   previous   night.   In   the   morning

Rajeshwari found Basamma lying dead. During the course

of investigation, it was alleged that these two petitioners

throttled and smothered Basamma with a pillow, while

Rajeshwari assisted them. All the accused persons made it

appear that some strangers had visited the house during

night and caused the death of Basamma. Basamma's gold

had been taken away and the entire plan was engineered by

petitioner Nos. 1 and 2 by closing the outer door of the

house of Basamma to avoid suspicion on Rajeshwari and as

well as petitioner Nos.1 and 2. Considering the above said

factual aspects, the bail petition came to be rejected by

Sessions Court at the threshold. Subsequently after filing of

the chargesheet also the petitions were dismissed for grant

of bail.   After filing of the chargesheet the petitioners

approached this Court in Crl.P. No.11049/2013. This Court

again considering all the factual aspects and materials
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                4</span>

available on record granted bail to accused No.3 on the

ground that she has an infant and she is forced to keep the

child with her in jail.   Therefore, on that sole ground this

Court has granted bail so far as accused No.3 - Smt.

Rajeshwari is concerned.      However, insofar as these two

petitioners are concerned, the bail petition was rejected as

the entire allegations were against them. Hence, there is no

room to overcome the said orders passed by this Court.


</p><p id="p_4">      3. The learned Additional State Public Prosecutor

submitted that the bail petition earlier filed immediately

after filing of chargesheet against the petitioners herein was

rejected. No fresh grounds have been made out to consider

the present bail petition. Hence, the petition is liable to be

rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">      4. The learned counsel for petitioners submitted that

the accused - petitioners have suffered from some injuries

prior to the incident and they are lagging in jail since 9

months. Therefore, it is a good case for grant of bail. When
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                5</span>

it is stated that prior to the incident the accused -

petitioners have sustained injuries, then that contention

would have been agitated by the petitioners in the previous

petition itself. Therefore, at this stage it cannot be said that

the petitioners are suffering from serious ailments and even

if it is considered they can approach the Sessions Court for

direction to the jail authorities to give treatment in an

equipped hospital.   Under the above said circumstances, I

do not find any strong reason to allow the petition. Hence,

petition stands dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">     As the petitioners are kept in judicial custody since

from nine months, the Sessions Judge is directed to expedite

the matter and complete the trial as early as possible.
