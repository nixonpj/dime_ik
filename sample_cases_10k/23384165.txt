                For Respondent No.3     : No Appearance 


:COMMON ORDER           

</pre><p id="p_2">        Since the issue raised in these batch of cases are one and the same and
the prayer sought for also are similar to each other, all these Writ
Petitions are decided by this common order.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        2. The facts leading to W.P.(MD)No.1015 of 2010 are taken up for the
purpose of deciding this issue. The petitioner in this Writ Petition being a
Partnership Firm, is a dealer in Paper and Board, and is an assessee on the
file of the first respondent under the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_2">Central Sales Tax Act</a>. The first
respondent had passed assessment order for the assessment year 1997-1998. An   
appeal was filed before the second respondent. The second respondent, by
order dated 22.04.2009, after having set aside the assessment order, had
remanded the matter back to the first respondent for re-consideration and re-
assessment. While remanding the matter back to the first respondent for re-
consideration, the second respondent has given specific directions to the
first respondent to re-assess the issue by ascertaining the following, as
indicated in the said order, which is re-produced hereunder:
</p>
<p id="p_4">        "After hearing rival contentions and also perusal of the assessment
file and other records revealed that the assessing authority ought to have
verified all the purchases as to whether the value of C form declaration
issued to the appellants/seller correctly tallied with that of the
counterfoil available with the purchasers who has paid tax on his final
product's sale value on the value of goods sold by the appellants.
</p><p id="p_5">        Similarly, the C forms which were filed by the appellants before the
assessing authority were obtained from the registered dealers and they were
bear the seal of the concerned assessing authority. While the fact was so,
the assessing authority has not taken any steps for verification of the issue
register of the Revenue. But, he has simply stating that it is not necessary
and there is no question of verification is need and the C forms are being
issued throughout India. The verification of C form issue register is to be
done in the nearby assessment circle, i.e. Sattur, Sivakasi and
Srivilliputhur. But, the assessing authority had not done so. This shows that
the assessing authority has not at all taken any steps for verification of C
form issue register and simply saying that it is not necessary."
</p>
<p id="p_6">        3. Pursuant to the said order of remand, the first respondent, being
the assessing authority, instead of undertaking the re-assessment, by
verifying the C Form as well as purchases as to whether the value of C Form
declaration issued to the appellants/seller correctly tallied with that of
the counterfoil available with the purchasers, who has paid tax, has simply
proceed to pass the present impugned order dated 30.11.2009. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">        4. In the said impugned order, the first respondent has given the
following reasons for passing the impugned order which reads thus:
</p><p id="p_8">        "Further, the Appellate Deputy Commissioner (CT), Virudhunagar has also
set aside the levy of penalty of Rs.251609.00 stating that the turnover was
very much available in the books of accounts and the revision of assessment
is only a re-assessment of the turnover, which was originally granted
exemption and will fullness is not established."
</p><p id="p_9">Therefore, challenging the said impugned order passed by the first
respondent, the present Writ Petition has been filed. The petitioner has also
filed other Writ Petition in W.P.(MD)No.1016 of 2010 for the assessment year
1995-1996. Similarly, other two petitioners have filed similar Writ Petitions
for the said two assessment years respectively with the similar prayer, where
also similar orders were passed by the Assessing Authority without conducting
the assessment, as directed by the second respondent-appellate authority as
stated above.
</p>
<p id="p_10">        5. Mr.A.S.Mujibur Rahman, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners
would contend that the appellate authority, viz., the second respondent,
after having considered various issues raised in the appeals filed by the
petitioners, has, in fact, framed number of questions to be answered and
after having considered each of the question framed by the appellate
authority, ultimate conclusion was also given, wherein the said directions
also had been given by the appellate authority, directing the Assessing
Authority, viz., the first respondent to re-assess the entire issue in the
manner indicated in the order of remand itself. When that being so, without
conducting re-assessment, as has been indicated or directed by the appellate
authority, the first respondent has passed the cryptic impugned orders,
wherein he has simply stated that the Appellate Deputy Commissioner had given 
an opportunity to the dealers by applying of return of C Forms for
ratification within a stipulated period and the dealers have neither applied
for return of 'C' Forms nor filed any fresh or rectified 'C' Forms so far.
Therefore, he had proceeded with passing the impugned orders of re-
assessment. The way in which the impugned orders were passed is totally 
against the mandatory directions given by the appellate authority in the
order of remand, which have not been followed by the first respondent.
Therefore, for that ground alone, the impugned orders are liable to be
interfered with.
</p>        
<p id="p_11">        6. The learned counsel for the petitioners would rely upon a judgment
of this Court made in a batch of cases in W.P.(MD)Nos.2807 of 2006, etc.,
batch, by order dated 17.09.2009 in the matter of Tvl.Uma Paper Mart  vs.
Commercial Tax Officer-I (FAC), Sivakasi, Virudhunagar District and another.
In the said judgment, the learned Judge, after having considered the facts of
the said cases and also after having considered the earlier judgment of this
Court made in W.P.(MD)Nos.809 to 816 of 2006, dated 12.07.2007, was pleased   
to allow the said batch of Writ Petitions. In view of the said decision of
this Court, where a number of Writ Petitions have been allowed, these Writ
Petitions with the similar facts and circumstances also covered by the said
decision of this Court. Therefore, the learned counsel for  the petitioners
would contend that similar orders can be passed in these batch of cases also
and he wants these Writ Petitions to be allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        7. Per contra, the learned Additional Government Pleader appearing for
the first and second respondents would contend that no doubt there was a
direction given by the appellate authority, whereby, as has been referred to
above, a specific direction was given to the Assessing Authority to re-assess
the issue in a particular manner by verifying each of the transaction along
with the counterfoils and also to verify the veracity of  the 'C' Forms
submitted by the petitioners. Without having resorted to the said course of
action, as has been directed by the appellate authority, since the first
respondent has passed the  impugned orders, it may not be justifiable for
completing the assessment. However, the learned Additional Government Pleader 
appearing for the first and second respondents would contend that non-
consideration of the first respondent in doing the re-assessment exercise
would not ipso facto make the petitioners entitled to claim the benefit of
setting aside the order and escape from the clutches of taxation. The learned
Additional Government Pleader would further contend that in the said batch of
cases, orders were passed on 17.09.2009. The issue was that the 'C' Forms
said to have been given by the officials concerned of the Department were
forged one. Therefore, since the Department officials themselves issued
forged 'C'  Forms, this Court had come to the rescue of the petitioners and
thereby, setting aside the orders of re-assessment and directed the
Department to take action against the erring officials. However, the facts
are slightly different in the present case, where the Assessing Officer has
not followed the mandatory directions issued by the appellate authority and,
therefore, once the matter is remanded back for re-consideration or re-
assessment, certainly, the Assessing Authority now would be ready and willing
to make re-assessment strictly in accordance with the directions issued by
the appellate authority in the order referred to above.
</p>        
<p id="p_13">        8. This Court had considered the rival submissions made by the learned
respective counsel appearing for the parties and also the judgments referred
to by them.
</p>
<p id="p_14">        9. As rightly contended by the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioners, re-assessment has not been done by the first respondent before
passing the impugned orders in accordance with the directions issued by the
appellate authority. This position cannot be controverted by the learned
Additional Government Pleader appearing for the respondents also. Therefore,
this Court is of the view that the impugned orders shall not stand in the
legal scrutiny as if an authority is directed to do a particular thing in a
particular manner, the same has to be done only in that manner not otherwise.
Here, in the case in hand, though a categorical direction was given by the
appellate authority, the same has not been followed by the Assessing
Authority and, therefore, the impugned orders followed by the non-
consideration on the part of the first respondent would not stand in the
legal scrutiny and, therefore, this Court has no hesitation to quash the said
impugned orders. Accordingly, the same are quashed. 
</p>

<p id="p_15">        10. However, as has been pointed out by the learned Additional
Government Pleader appearing for the first and second respondents, the
direction given by the appellate authority can very well be followed by the
present Assessing Authority, if the matter is remanded back. Therefore, this
Court is of the view that the matter can be remanded back to the Assessing
Authority to re-assess the entire issue strictly in accordance with the
directions issued by the appellate authority in the order passed on
22.04.2009 and after affording a reasonable opportunity for each of the
petitioner for being heard, re-assessment exercise shall be completed, within
a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
Accordingly, final orders can also be passed by the Assessing Authority after
meeting out every point being raised by the petitioners on their behalf.
</p><p id="p_16">        11. With these directions, the Writ Petitions are allowed in part. No
costs. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
