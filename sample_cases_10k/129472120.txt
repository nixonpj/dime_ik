                W.P.(C).No.24261 of 2016
         -------------------------------------
          Dated this the 23rd day of November, 2017

                    J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">    Petitioner, who retired as Clerk from an aided School

on 31.05.2016, has filed this writ petition seeking a

direction to the respondents to treat the period of his

absence from service, on account of a criminal case as

duty for all purposes and to grant him all service

benefits.
</p>
<p id="p_2">    2.   While working as Clerk in an aided School,

petitioner was placed under suspension with effect from

12.09.1996, when he was remanded to police custody, on

account  of  a  crime   registered    against  him.  He was

thereafter  convicted   as    per   Ext.P1   judgment  dated

27.11.1998 in C.C.No.7/1997 of the Judicial First Class

Magistrate Court, Pattambi, for offences under <a href="/doc/436339/" id="a_1">Sections

381</a>, <a href="/doc/1873755/" id="a_2">457</a> and <a href="/doc/839778/" id="a_3">380</a> of IPC. Criminal Appeal No.179 of 1998

filed by the petitioner was dismissed on 14.01.2004.

Thereafter, as per Ext.P3 judgment dated 06.04.2004 in the

Criminal Revision Petition No.324 of 2004 filed by him,

petitioner was found not guilty and the conviction and

W.P.(C).No.24261 of 2016
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              2</span>

sentence passed by the court below was set aside, allowing

the Revision Petition. This Court found that there was no

legal evidence connecting the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_3">      3.    In the meanwhile, the Manager had issued Ext.P1

order dated 25.01.2005 dismissing the petitioner from

service    with effect from    12.09.1996-the date  of  his

suspension, consequent to the conviction. Thereafter, on

his acquittal as per Ext.P3 judgment, the Manager of the

School    re-instated    the petitioner  with effect   from

01.03.2016 and sought approval for the same from the

District Educational Officer, who approved the same as per

Ext.P6 order. The petitioner re-joined and thereafter

retired from service on 31.05.2016. Petitioner was thus

kept out of service for the period from 12.09.1996 to

01.03.2016. Petitioner thereafter approached the DPI with

Ext.P7     representation   requesting  to   sanction  his

pensionary benefits reckoning his entire service from

7.6.1982 to 31.05.2016. He thereafter filed the writ

petition alleging inaction on it and seeking directions to

the respondents to reckon the entire period during which

he was kept out of service for all service benefits and to

grant his terminal benefits reckoning also the period

W.P.(C).No.24261 of 2016
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               3</span>

during which he was kept out of service on account of

suspension and thereafter, consequent to his removal. The

writ petition is filed at that stage.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4.    The 4th respondent has filed a counter affidavit,

stating    that    disciplinary proceedings  were  initiated

against the petitioner under Rule 75     of Chapter XIV A of

KER on the basis of the judgment in criminal case; a show

cause   notice     was  issued  to  petitioner  seeking  his

explanation as to the proposal to remove him from service

and after considering his representation, he was removed

from service with effect from 12.09.1996. It is further

stated   that    when   the criminal revision petition    was

allowed and the petitioner was acquitted and exhonorated

from all the charges, he approached the Manager for

reinstatement and the Manager forwarded the request to the

4th  respondent and on the basis of his application,

petitioner's appointment was approved with effect from

01.03.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5.    In the counter affidavit, the 4th respondent does

not say anything regarding the entitlement or otherwise of

the petitioner for the benefits for the period during

which he was kept out of service. Therefore the claim of

W.P.(C).No.24261 of 2016
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               4</span>

the   petitioner     for  the service benefits  has  to  be

examined, with reference to the rules.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6.    The sole reason for removing the petitioner from

service was the conviction of the petitioner in a criminal

case.   The crime was registered against him   for offences

under <a href="/doc/436339/" id="a_4">Section 381</a> and <a href="/doc/1873755/" id="a_5">Section 457</a> of IPC. He was placed

under suspension on 12.09.1996. He was convicted by the

trial court on 27.11.1998. He was dismissed from service

on 25.01.2005 as per Ext.P2 order, with effect from the

date of suspension i.e., 12.09.1996. Consequent to the

acquittal, he was re-instated in service with effect from

01.03.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      7.    From Ext.P2 order of dismissal, it is seen that

the dismissal was solely on account of the conviction in

the criminal case, as provided in the Government Order No.

28/03 (G.O.(P).No.28/03 (P) &amp; ARD dated 18.09.2003) as

well as the provisions contained in Clause (a) of the 2nd

proviso    to   Rule    18 (iii) of  Kerala  Civil  Service

(Classification       Control  &amp;   Appeal)   Rules,    1960.

Reinstatement was ordered    under Clause (b) of the proviso

to Rule 18 (iii) which provides that he would be entitled

to all the service benefits as if he continued in service.

W.P.(C).No.24261 of 2016
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 5</span>

Clause (a) to the 2nd proviso to Rule 18 (iii) provides for

dismissal or removal of a Government servant,         consequent

to conviction in criminal case.         Clause (b) to the 2nd

proviso     to     Rule    18   of    Kerala    Civil     Service

(Classification,      Control  and   Appeal)    Rules   read  as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "(b) in case the said conviction is subsequently
           set aside in appeal or otherwise and the Government
           servant is acquitted of the charges, the order of
           dismissal or removal ceases to have effect and
           revised    orders shall be   issued  forthwith   to
           reinstate him in service entitling him all the
           benefits to which he would have been entitled had
           he been in service:"</blockquote><p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">      8.    The question whether a person who was removed

from service on account of conviction in criminal case and

was re-instated on the basis of acquittal in appeal,          is

entitled to the entire service benefits was the subject

matter for consideration in the judgment of the Full Bench

of this Court in <a href="/doc/562545/" id="a_6">State of Kerala and Another v. N.G.Joseph</a>

[2014 (4) KHC 841]. After interpreting the provisions

contained in Rule 18 (iii) of KCS CC &amp; A Rules, 1960,         it

was held that such a person, who was kept out of service

on account of criminal case when re-instated after his

acquittal in criminal case,         would be entitled to the

entire service benefits for the period from the date of

W.P.(C).No.24261 of 2016
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                            6</span>

his dismissal to date of re-instatement,   as provided in

Rule 18 (iii) (b) Kerala Civil Service (Classification,

Control and Appeal) Rules, 1960. However, the dismissal

with effect from the date of suspension was found illegal.

It was held that the period from date of suspension to

date of dismissal has to be considered for regularization

in accordance with the provisions contained in Part I KSR.

</p><p id="p_10">      9.    In this case the petitioner was placed under

suspension pending the criminal case. He was dismissed on

25.01.2005. The decision of the Full Bench in N.G.Joseph's

case (supra) as well as the provisions in Clause (b) below

the 2nd proviso to Rule 18 (iii) of the Kerala Civil

Service (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, make

it clear that, in case the conviction is subsequently set

aside in appeal or revision and the Government servant is

acquitted of the charges, the order of dismissal or

removal ceases to have effect and revised orders shall be

issued forthwith to reinstate him in service entitling him

to all the benefits to which he would have been entitled,

had he been in service. Therefore, the petitioner is

entitled to get the entire service benefits including the

arrears of pay for the period during which he was kept out

W.P.(C).No.24261 of 2016
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                7</span>

of service on account of dismissal from service up to his

date of reinstatement on acquittal i.e., for the period

from 25.01.2005 to 28.02.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      10. However the period during which he was kept

under suspension till the date of his dismissal as per

Ext.P2 order i.e from 12.09.1996 to 25.01.2005, is to be

regularized     by    the Manager,   who  placed  him  under

suspension, in accordance with the provisions contained in

Part I KSR. This Court in the Criminal Revision Petition

had found that there is no evidence to connect the

petitioner to any of the charges alleged against the

petitioner. It is seen that disciplinary proceedings did

not proceed further.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      11. In the result there shall be the following

declarations and directions:
</p>
<p id="p_13">(i)     The petitioner would be entitled to all the service

        benefits     for  the   period  from  25.01.2005 to

        28.02.2016 i.e the period between the date of

        dismissal and date of re-instatement;
</p>
<p id="p_14">(ii)    The     5th   respondent   shall  pass   orders  of

        regularization of the period of suspension of the

        petitioner     for the   period from  19.02.1996  to

        25.01.2005, within a period of 'two months' from

        the date of receipt of a copy of the judgment.

</p><p id="p_15">(iii) On the basis of the orders to be passed by the 5th

        respondent, the respondents 1 to 4 shall see that

        the    pay   and pensionary benefits  due   to the

        petitioner are fixed, sanctioned and disbursed to

        him, within a further period of 'three months'.
