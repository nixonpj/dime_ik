                                 Debasish Mandal &amp; Ors.
</p>

<p id="p_3">For the Appellant/Applicant :   Mr. Tapan Chakraborty.
</p>

<pre id="pre_1">Heard On           :      29-03-2016.

Judgement On       :      29-03-2016.


</pre><p id="p_4">      Jyotirmay Bhattacharya, J. : This second appeal is directed against the
judgement and decree dated 17th July, 2014 passed by the learned Additional
District Judge, 5th Court, Nadia in Title Appeal No. 61 of 2013 affirming the
judgement and decree dated 24th July, 2013 passed by the learned Civil Judge
(Junior Division), Additional Court, Krishnagar, Nadia in Title Suit No. 29 of 2012
at the instance of the plaintiff/appellant.
</p>

<p id="p_5">      Let us now consider the merit of the appeal to find out as to whether any
substantial question of law is involved in this appeal for which the appeal is
required to be admitted for hearing under the provision of Order XLI Rule 11 of
the Code of Civil Procedure or not.
</p><p id="p_6">       The plaintiff filed a suit for declaration and permanent injunction. She
complained that if the construction is allowed to be raised by the defendants on
"B" schedule property, then the plaintiff's easementary right of light and air in
her property will be affected. She further complained that the construction was
not raised in accordance with the Building Rules of the West Bengal Gram
Panchayat Administration Rules, 1981.
</p>

<p id="p_7">      The learned Trial Judge dismissed the said suit on contest.
</p>

<p id="p_8">      Being aggrieved by the said judgement and decree passed by the learned
Trial Judge, the plaintiff filed an appeal before the appeal court. The said appeal
was also dismissed by the learned appeal court. Hence, the instant second
appeal has been filed.
</p>

<p id="p_9">      The learned appeal court held that having regard to the fact that during the
pendency of the suit the construction has been completed, no relief can be
granted to the plaintiff as the plaintiff has not prayed for appropriate relief by
way of mandatory injunction for demolition of the construction by bringing on
record the subsequent events regarding completion of such construction at the
instance of the defendants during the pendency of the suit.
</p>

<p id="p_10">      Though we find that the plaintiff sought for a declaratory relief and a
prohibitory injunction in the suit, but for bringing the subsequent events
regarding completion of such construction during the pendency of the suit and
for incorporating an additional relief by way of mandatory injunction, she filed an
application under Order 6 Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure for amendment
of the plaint. She accepted the order of the learned Trial Judge by which her
prayer for amendment of plaint was rejected by the learned Trial Judge.
</p>

<p id="p_11">      The plaintiff/appellant did not challenge the legality and/or correctness of
the said order, rejecting the plaintiff's application for amendment of plaint while
 she filed the first appeal before the learned appeal court. Since the
plaintiff/appellant accepted the order rejecting her application for amendment of
the plaint, she cannot now challenge the legality of the said order for the first
time in this second appeal by jumping the forum.
</p>

<p id="p_12">      We, thus, do not find any reason to disagree with the findings of the
learned appeal court that no relief can be granted to the plaintiff in the instant
suit as the plaintiff has neither brought the subsequent events on record by way
of amendment nor she has prayed for any mandatory injunction for demolition of
the unauthorised construction which allegedly affects her easementary right of
air and light in her premises.
</p>

<p id="p_13">      Accordingly, we do not find involvement of any substantial question of law
in this appeal for which the appeal is required to be admitted. We thus decline to
admit this appeal for hearing under the provision of Order XLI Rule 11 of the
Code of Civil Procedure.
</p>

<p id="p_14">      The appeal thus stands dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_15">                    Re: CAN 3391 of 2015 (Stay)



      Since we have not admitted the appeal under the provision of Order XLI
Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, no further order need be passed on the
interim application for stay. The said application being CAN 3391 of 2015 is thus
deemed to be disposed of.
</p>
