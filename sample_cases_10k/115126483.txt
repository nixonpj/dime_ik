                    HON' BLE MR. JUSTICE MANASH RANJAN PATHAK

                                              ORDER

</p>
<p id="p_2">         Being aggrieved with the order of the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax, Dibrugarh
issued under Memo No. T/J-105-Pr.CIT/DBR/2018-19/466-80 dated 02.05.2018, whereby the said

1 herein/writ petitioner having Pan No. AEDPB9900P from the Assessing Officer, ACIT, Circle-1,
Dibrugarh to the Assessing Officer, Central Circle-4(3), Kolkata, the said Assessee, respondent No. 1
preferred the connected WP(C) No. 3007/2018 stating that the aforesaid impugned order dated
02.05.2018 is not in conformity with the decision and direction of the Division Bench of this Court
dated 25.02.2016 passed in WP(C) No. 5828/2015 (Mul Chand Malu Vs. Union of India and Ors .) that
relates to transfer of cases under <a href="/doc/330339/" id="a_2">Section 127</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
</p><p id="p_3">                                                                                           Page No.# 4/4

         While issuing notice to the respondents in said WP(C) No. 3007/2018 on 16.05.2018, in the

Dibrugarh dated 02.05.2018, which is still in force. Rule in said writ petition was issued on
14.11.2018.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         However, on the prayer of the applicants/respondent Income Tax Department, the Court by a
common order dated 24.09.2018 passed in WP(C) No.3061/2018 observed that during pendency of
said writ petition, there shall not be a bar on the part of the Income Tax Department to issue notice to
the Assessee, the concerned writ petitioner/the respondent No. 1 herein, under <a href="/doc/581124/" id="a_3">Section 153(A)</a> of the
1961 Act, if so advised.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         The applicants i.e., the Income Tax Department has preferred this application for a specific
observation/direction/clarification as to which of the Assessing Officer, whether the Transferor
Assessing Officers at Dibrugarh, i.e., ACIT, Circle-1, Dibrugarh or the Transferee Assessing Officers at
Kolkata, i.e., ACIT, Central Circle-4(3), Kolkata shall issue notice under <a href="/doc/581124/" id="a_4">Section 153(A)</a> of the IT Act,
1961 to the respondent No.1/writ petitioner in terms of the common order dated 24.09.2018 passed
in WP(C) No. 3061/2018.
</p>
<p id="p_6">          It is to be noted herein that the order of the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax,
Dibrugarh dated 02.05.2018 transferring the case of the concerned Assessee, i.e., the respondent No.
1 herein/ writ petitioner from the Assessing Officer, ACIT, Circle-1, Dibrugarh to the Assessing Officer
of Central Circle-4(3), Kolkata is under suspension since 16.05.2018 in terms of the order of the Court
dated 16.05.2018 passed in said WP(C) No. 3007/2018 as noted above, which is in force till date and
therefore, any such notice to the said Assessee, i.e., the respondent No. 1 herein/writ petitioner under
<a href="/doc/581124/" id="a_5">Section 153(A)</a> of the 1961 Act, need to be issued only by the concerned Assessing Officer, ACIT,

of.
