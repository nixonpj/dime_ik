                                      The petitioner impugns the orders dated 12.03.2013

              and 15.05.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                                      The    petitioner        is   a   landlady,    who    has     initiated

              proceedings under Section 13 of the East Punjab Urban Rent

              Restriction              Act     (Act    III    of    1949)    seeking    eviction        of   the

              respondents on the ground of non-payment of rent; subletting and

              bona fide necessity.

<p id="p_3">                                      On 05.10.2007, the issues in this case were framed

              and evidence was led by way of filing an affidavit on 31.05.2010

              by RW1.                 His examination-in-chief was recorded on 27.07.2012

              and              the    matter     was         adjourned      to   26.02.2013       for    cross-

              examination of the witness, which was conducted on the said date

              partly. The matter was adjourned to 08.03.2013. On that date,

              that the file was not traceable. Thereafter, on 12.03.2013, the

              Court Commissioner recorded in its proceedings that for cross-

              examination opportunity given to the petitioner was not availed of

              by him and, thus, treated it as Nil.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                               The matter was then adjourned to 13.03.2013 for

              recording of the remaining evidence. This is the date fixed by the

              Court for receiving the report of the Court Commissioner on the

              evidence recorded by him.              The petitioner then moved an

              application for recalling of the order dated 12.03.2013 by which

              cross-examination of RW1 Manwinder Singh was treated as Nil.

              The learned Rent Controller has declined this prayer primarily on

              the ground that it had no power to review its own order and

              partially on the ground that the case is an old case requiring

              immediate disposal and also for the reason that the Court

              Commissioner had stated that on 12.03.2013, he had waited for

              the petitioner up to 2.00 P.M. for effecting cross-examination of

              the witness.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                               Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that on

              08.03.2013,         no   order   was   passed   by   the   Commissioner,

              adjourning the proceedings to 12.03.2013 and, thus, he was not

              aware of the proceedings and this is the reason which prevented

              him from conducting the cross-examination of the said witness.

              He has placed on record an application filed by him for obtaining

              the orders of Commissioner dated 08.03.2013 but which was

              returned with a report that no such order was on file. Copy of

              application for obtaining copy of the order, even though was not

              placed on record but shown today to the Court, is taken on record

</p>
<p id="p_6">                               It is, thus, contended before this Court that serious

              prejudice has been caused to the petitioner on account of these

              facts, which have prevented her from effecting the cross-

              examination of the witness.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                               The learned counsel for the respondents on the other

              hand, contends that the petitioner lacks bona fides and that she

              has levelled wild allegation against the Court Commissioner, who

              is an Officer of the Court and besides this plea was taken by the

              petitioner before the learned District Judge on the administrative

              side who has opined that the plea of the petitioner is erroneous.

</p><p id="p_8">                               I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have

              perused the impugned orders. In so far as the reasoning adopted

              by the learned Rent Controller regarding the power of review is

              concerned, I am of the view that it has fallen in error for the

              reason that strict rules of the Code of Civil Procedure are not

              applicable to the <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_1">Rent Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                               Be that as it may, in such like matters, the power of

              recalling of an order should not be subjected to technicalities, if it

              enhances         cause   of   substantial   justice.   The   order   dated

              26.02.2013 has been extracted in the proceedings, where the

              Commissioner had noted that in case, the cross-examination of

              the said witness (RW1) is not concluded on 08.03.2013, the cross-

              examination shall be deemed to be treated as Nil.                      On

              08.03.2013, no order was passed as the file was untraceable. In

              these given set of circumstances, which are not disputed till at

              least 08.03.2013 even by the learned counsel for the respondent,

              except to say that the proceedings were prevented on account of

              the fact that the lawyers were abstaining from work and not on

              account of the fact that the file was untraceable.        Even if this be

              so, the fact remains that on 08.03.2013, no order was passed by

              the Commissioner. To allay any apprehension, it would have been

              just and appropriate for the Commissioner to have observed that

              the proceedings cannot be held for the reason that lawyers are

              abstaining from work, if the plea of the respondents is to be

              accepted that this was the reason to keep the proceedings in

              abeyance.         Rather there is material to indicate that no order

              existed on 08.03.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                               This clearly led to some ambiguity regarding the next

              date of hearing and whether it was communicated to the

              petitioner or not. These observations of the Court should not in

              any way be construed to be an expression regarding the lack of

              confidence in the Court Commissioner and neither it is intended to

              grant authenticity to the allegations levelled by the petitioner

              against the Commissioner.              Suffice it so say, the Court is

              convinced that there has been certain slip up between the two

              proceedings conducted on 08.03.2013 and 12.03.2013 which

              have further resulted in a situation prejudicial to the interest of

              the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                               To settle equities and to subserve the cause of justice,

              I am of the opinion that the petitioner be given one opportunity to

              cross-examine the said witness subject to payment of             `5000/-

              which are imposed only by keeping in view the fact that it is a

              case which has been hanging fire for almost 7 years and it is
