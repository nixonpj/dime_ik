ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">    	 The  petitioner has  filed the above  writ petition  to issue a writ            of   Certiorarified Mandamus to call for the records of the respondent in his proceedings in G.O.No.2157/RSV/C/2015-16, dated 11.01.2016 and to  quash the detention order as illegal and contrary to the provisions of the  Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act and direct the respondent to release the goods.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. It is the case of the petitioner that  he is operating transport services to transport parcel of goods from Delhi to Chennai in big trucks and deliver the goods to the actual consignees.  Once the goods are reached in Chennai, the parcels in the  goods vehicle  are unloaded in the godown and transported to the buyers in Chennai in mini vehicles as big trucks  cannot be brought into Chennai City during day time.  While so,  the petitioner  transported  the consignment of goods containing electrical goods, dry fruits, sanitary fittings, cables, footwear and general goods from Delhi to Chennai.  However, the respondent has detained the goods by issue of Goods Detention Notice at  Sales Tax  office at Greams Road, Chennai.  In the case on hand, both the consignors and consignees  are registered  dealers under local <a href="/doc/1939811/" id="a_2">VAT Act</a> and also <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_3">Central Sales Tax Act</a>.  According to the  petitioner, the respondent  had detained the vehicle  after receipt of the bills and  invoices  for the reason to verify the genuineness of the transactions.  
</p>	
<p id="p_3">	3.  Mr.S.Kanmani Annamalai learned Additional Government Pleader appearing for the respondent  submitted that  the petitioner  may be directed to  submit all the records pertaining  to goods transported in the vehicle  and the respondent  may be directed to verify the goods and value the same in the presence of the petitioner and after quantifying the tax component, the respondent may be directed to return the goods to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	 4. Mr.C.Baktha Siromoni, learned counsel appearing for  the  petitioner also agreed for the proposals made by the learned Additional Government Pleader and submitted that the petitioner will  appear before the respondent  with all necessary documents   on 13.02.2016 at  3.00 p.m. 
	
</p><p id="p_5">	5. Having regard to the submissions made by the learned counsel on either side,  I direct the petitioner  to appear before the respondent with all necessary documents on 13.02.2016 at  3.00 p.m. and I direct the respondent  to verify the  goods and value the same  and  quantify  the tax component payable by the petitioner in his presence.  On payment of the tax quantified by the respondent, the respondent is directed to release the goods forthwith.    
</p><p id="p_6">	 With  these observations,  the writ petition  is disposed of.   No costs.   </p><pre id="pre_2">
