</p>
<p id="p_2">IA No. 728/2012 in CS(OS) 1984/2009

</p><p id="p_3">1.    The present application has been filed by the Plaintiff under
Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure praying for directions to
the Registry of this Court to prepare decree sheet in terms of the
judgment and order of this Court dated 23.12.2010 without requiring
the parties to file stamp duty.
</p><p id="p_4">2.    The abovementioned suit was filed by the Plaintiff, Shri Anil
Nath against the Defendant, Smt. Gita Kapur, seeking inter alia




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(OS) 1984/2009                                           Page 1 of 8</span>
 partition of first floor, second floor, and terrace floor of the property
bearing No. D-32, Saket, New Delhi.
</p><p id="p_5">3.    The case of the Plaintiff was that Shri Man Mohan Nath, father
of the Plaintiff and the Defendant, was the owner of the suit property
and after he died intestate on 21.05.2006, the Plaintiff, the Defendant
&amp; their mother, Smt. Shashi Nath became owners of the said
property. Subsequently, on 1st May 2009, the mother of the Plaintiff
and the Defendant also died and the Plaintiff and the Defendant
became owners of one-half share each in the said property.
</p><p id="p_6">4.    During the pendency of the suit, the parties orally settled their
disputes and entered into a Memorandum of Past Oral Family
Arrangement and Understanding on 01.10.2010 recording the oral
arrangement/agreement between the parties. Thereafter, the parties
jointly filed an application bearing IA No. 17509/2010 under Order
XXIII Rule 3 of CPC, which was allowed by this Court on
23.12.2010 in the following terms:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "IA No.17509/2010 (under O. 23 R. 3 r/w S. 151 of
      the CPC)
      This is an application filed by the parties under the
      provisions of Order 23 Rule 3 read with Section 151
      of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 ( in short,
      „CPC‟). The parties have arrived at a settlement
      under the aegis of the Delhi High Court Mediation
      and Conciliation Centre. The settlement is recorded
      in the „Memorandum of Past Oral Family
      Arrangement and Understanding‟( in short, „MOU‟)
      dated 01.10.2010. The original of the Memorandum

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(OS) 1984/2009                                          Page 2 of 8</span>
       (Ex. „X‟), appended in Part-I of the court file, has
      been filed by the Mediator. The captioned application
      (Ex. „Y‟) bears the signatures of the plaintiff and the
      defendant as well as the counsels for the parties. The
      captioned application is also accompanied by the
      affidavits of the plaintiff and the defendant.
      In view of the settlement arrived at between the
      parties through intersession of the Delhi High Court
      Mediation and Conciliation Centre, which is even
      otherwise lawful, I decree the suit in terms of
      paragraph no.4 of the settlement. A decree sheet be
      prepared accordingly. The Memorandum (Ex.„X‟)
      and the captioned application (Ex.„Y‟) shall form part
      of the decree. The captioned application and the suit
      are disposed of.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      The suit be consigned to record."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">5.    The Registry of this Court, by its letter dated 18.08.2011,
required the parties to furnish valuation report of the subject property
for the purpose of calculating the stamp duty in order to prepare the
decree. It is the case of the Plaintiff-applicant that no stamp duty is
required to be paid as no right or interest is being created in favour of
the Plaintiff or the Defendant by the decree which is to be passed in
terms of the settlement recorded between the parties. It is contended
that by way of the settlement arrived at, the parties merely agreed to
retain possession of their respective floors and made arrangements
regarding the sharing of terrace over the second floor pursuant to the
oral agreement arrived at between the parties.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS) 1984/2009                                          Page 3 of 8</span>
<p id="p_8"> 6.    Upon filing of the present application by the plaintiff, the
Registry was directed to file a report in this regard. Accordingly, the
Registry filed a Report dated 03.12.2012, wherein it is claimed that
the issue before the Court was not of declaration but for clear cut
demarcation of rights regarding ownership of specific portions of the
property amongst the parties to the suit, and therefore the decree in
the instant case will be an 'instrument of partition' as defined in
<a href="/doc/125784657/" id="a_1">Section 2(15)</a> of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. Reliance is placed on
the following portion of the judgment of a Division Bench of this
Court in B.S.Goel and Others versus The Registrar, High Court of
Delhi, AIR 2007 Delhi 72:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      ".............They have agreed to divide immovable
      property in severalty in terms of the compromise
      application thus creating rights and extinguishing
      rights in the immovable properties which
      compulsorily requires a decree to be drawn up on a
      stamp paper of adequate value. Reliance on the case
      of Ravinder Kumar Rishi (supra), is also misplaced
      for the reason that in the said case, the court was not
      dealing with the issue of requirement of stamp duty
      for drawing up a decree of compromise, but the
      payment of ad-valorem court fee under the <a href="/doc/138097064/" id="a_2">Court Fee
      Act</a> as a condition precedent for drawing up a decree
      in terms of a compromise arrived at between the
      parties."
</blockquote><p id="p_9">7.    I have heard the learned counsel for the Plaintiff and
scrutinized the record.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) 1984/2009                                        Page 4 of 8</span>
<p id="p_10"> 8.    The law in this regard is fairly well settled. An 'instrument of
partition' as defined in <a href="/doc/125784657/" id="a_3">Section 2(15)</a> of the Stamp Act, 1899 includes
a final order for affecting a partition passed by any Civil Court.
However, by a catena of judgments, it is well settled that every decree
in a partition suit is not an 'instrument of partition' and cannot be
required to be registered and drawn on a stamp paper. A Division
Bench of this court in the case of Nitin Jain Vs. Anuj Jain and
Others AIR 2007 Delhi 219, reiterated the settled position of law in
the following words:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "8. The Courts have recognized that it is legally
      permissible to arrive at an oral family settlement
      dividing/partitioning the properties and thereafter
      record a memorandum in writing whereby the existing
      joint owners for the sake of posterity record that the
      property has been already partitioned or divided. The
      memorandum does not by itself partition the properties
      but only records for information what has already been
      done by oral partition. The memorandum itself does not
      create or extinguish any rights. A record of oral
      partition in writing is created. The writing records a
      pre-existing right and does not by itself partition the
      properties for the first time. As the memorandum only
      records oral partition which has already taken place
      but does not in praesenti create any right, it cannot be
      treated as an instrument creating partition."
</blockquote><p id="p_11">9.    Reliance placed by the Registry of this Court in its Report
on the judgment of B.S.Goel and Others (Supra) is misplaced as the
said case is clearly distinguishable on facts. In the said case stamp
duty was held to be chargeable as the Court had come to the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS) 1984/2009                                        Page 5 of 8</span>
 conclusion that the decree in the said case was not directed to be
drawn up by the learned Single Judge by recognising the oral family
settlement arrived at between the appellants and reduced into writing
by way of a memorandum of family settlement dated 31.10.2002, but
instead a decree was directed to be drawn up in terms of the
compromise arrived at between the parties as contained in the
compromise application. It was stated in the application that the
memorandum of family settlement dated 31.10.2002 stood
modified in terms of the application and the final compromise as
arrived at between the parties was stated in para 3 of the
application.
</p><p id="p_12">10.   To be noted that the Division Bench in the aforesaid case also
reiterated the settled legal position that: "........ any decree drawn by
the Court recognising an oral partition between the members of
family settlement which had taken place earlier and concretised in a
memorandum of family settlement does not require execution on a
stamp paper or require compulsory registration."
</p><p id="p_13">11.   Applying the aforesaid legal position to the facts of the present
case, in my considered opinion, there is merit in the prayer made in
the present application. A joint application was filed by the parties
under Order XXIII Rule 3, stating therein that the matter was
compromised and settled between the parties and accordingly a
'Memorandum of Past Oral Family Arrangement and Understanding'
was executed between the parties pursuant to the oral settlement on


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS) 1984/2009                                        Page 6 of 8</span>
 01.10.2010.The suit was decreed on 23.12.2010 in terms of para 4 of
the said Memorandum of Settlement (Ex.'X') and a decree sheet was
ordered to be prepared. Memorandum of Settlement (Ex.'X') and the
joint application (Ex.'Y') were to form part of the decree.
</p><p id="p_14">12.   A perusal of the 'Memorandum of Past Oral Family
Arrangement and Understanding' dated 01.10.2010 further reveals
that the settlement was in fact entered into between the parties on/or
around 30.05.2010 and the parties intended to reduce the same into
writing by way of the said Memorandum, which was eventually
executed on 01.10.2010. Para 4 of the Settlement, in terms of which
the decree is to be passed, contains the following recital evidencing
the factum of oral settlement:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "4. That the said arrangement shall be considered as
      a Past Oral Family Arrangement with regard to the
      property at D-32, Saket, 1st, 2nd Floor and roof rights,
      one car parking, 2 servant quarters one for each other"
</blockquote><p id="p_15">13.   It is therefore clear that the suit property was divided between
the parties by an oral family settlement and by way of the
'Memorandum of Past Oral Family Arrangement and Understanding'
dated 01.10.2010 the parties only intended to reduce the same into
writing. Accordingly, neither the Memorandum of Settlement nor the
decree passed in terms thereof can be said to be an 'instrument of
partition' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/125784657/" id="a_4">Section 2(15)</a> of the Stamp Act, 1899
requiring payment of stamp duty as per <a href="/doc/1791268/" id="a_5">Article 45</a> thereof.

<p id="p_16"> 14.   In view of the aforesaid discussion, the Registry's letter dated
18.08.2011 cannot be said to be justified. The Registry is directed to
draw up a decree sheet without insisting on submission of valuation
report by the parties and/or payment of stamp duty.
</p><p id="p_17">15.   The application stands disposed of in the above terms.
