             =====================
                W.P.(C) No. 19056 of 2014
            ======================
           Dated this the 23rd day of July, 2014

</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The petitioner is aggrieved by the detention of goods

as per Ext.P2 notice. Admittedly, the petitioner's vehicle

did not stop at the check post, and the department alertly

chase the vehicle and detained it after 18 kms. However, on

going through the documents, accompanying the check

post, it was seen that a valid invoice wherein, concessional

rate of tax as applicable under the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_1">CST Act</a> was collected on

the basis of C-Forms accompanied the goods. The goods

also was declined at the incoming RTO check post.

However, the notice given does not disclose any suspicion of

evasion of tax, but only raises a contention of the defect of

the driver not having stopped at the check post despite

there being a mandate under the Act to stop the vehicle at

the check post, to declare the goods.       The said defect

however cannot raise a suspicion of evasion of tax

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C) No. 19056 of 2014     2</span>




especially when the goods were seen to have been

accompanied with proper documents.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2. In any circumstance, considering the fact of the

driver of the vehicle having not chosen to stop the vehicle

even after an attempt was made by the check post

authorities to check the vehicle. The petitioner shall be

allowed to release the goods on depositing Rs.10,000/-

(Rupees ten thousand only/-) along with execution of simple

bond with solvent sureties as expeditiously on production of

a certified copy of this judgment.        The adjudication

proceedings shall be carried on untrammeled by the

observations made by this Court.

<p id="p_3">     The Writ Petition is disposed of.
