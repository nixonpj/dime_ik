                                 AWARD


                    The workman Sh. Chandeshwar, raised an industrial

dispute regarding the termination of his services by the management

of M/s Manish Industries. Direct statement of claim was filed by the

workman in the court.   In the statement of claim, it is stated by the

workman that the workman had been working with the management


I.D. No. 108/07                                              Page 1 out of 6
 on the post of 'machine man' since November, 2005 at a monthly

salary of Rs. 3200/­ per month; that the workman performed his duty

honestly   and   had   never   given   any   chance   of   complaint   to   the

management; that the management had taken the work of 12 hours

per day and also not providing him the legal facilities like overtime

wages, leave wages, appointment letter with correct date of entry,

E.S.I., attendance card, P.F, Bonus etc and on demanding the same

the   management   got   annoyed   and   terminated   the   services   of   the

workman   on   11.01.2007   without   issuing   any   charge   sheet   and

without   paying   the   earned   wages   for   the   month   of   November,

December and ten days of January, 2007 or issuance of any memo or

show cause notice; that the management had adopted the anti labour

policy   in   violation   of   provision   of   section   25   (F)   &amp;   (G)   of   the

Industrial  Disputes  Act  1947;  that  the management  had  taken the

signatures of the workman on various blank papers and vouchers;

that the workman had sent a demand notice to the management but

the management neither gave any reply nor reinstated the workman

on duty; that the workman had filed a complaint as also a statement

of claim against the management before the ALC, Karampura, Delhi

but to no avail; that the workman  is unemployed since the date of

his termination.  Hence, the workman has claimed for reinstatement

with full back wages, continuity of service and all  his dues.  


I.D. No. 108/07                                                     Page 2 out of 6
                     Notice of the filing of statement of claim was sent to the

management.  The management did not appear nor  filed the written

statement to the statement of claim of the workman despite service

by way of affixation. The management was proceeded exparte vide

order dated 13.12.2007 and the case  fixed for  ex­parte evidence on

behalf of the workman.

                Workman himself  appeared as WW1, filed his affidavit

by way of evidence Ex.WW1/A.   In his affidavit he has reiterated

the contents of his statement of claim. He has relied upon certain

documents   Exts.WW1/1   to   WW1/5,   on   record.   Thereafter   the

workman absented himself from the proceedings and did not tender

any arguments. Hence the case was fixed for award vide order dated

29.11.2010.

                 It is seen from the record that the workman has not led

any direct evidence in respect of his contention of being in service of

the management on the post, salary and for the period alleged by

way   of   copy   of   any   appointment   letter,   work   certificate,   written

agreement or even any proof of his having done the work as alleged

by   him   for   the   respondent/alleged   management   for   the   period</pre>

<p id="p_1">alleged   on   the   remuneration   alleged.     It   is   further   seen   from   the

record that the workman has not led any evidence in his workman

evidence in corroboration of his allegation that the management  did


I.D. No. 108/07                                                    Page 3 out of 6
 not provide the legal facilities such as overtime wages, leave wages,

appointment letter with correct date of entry, E.S.I, attendance cards,

P.F, Bonus etc. as alleged by him by way of testimony of any other

workman witness in this regard in his workman evidence or even

calling   for   the   said   records   from   the   management   or   the

concerned/competent  authority  in his WE under the provisions  of

Section 11 (3) (b) of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_1">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947 (as amended

upto date)   which he was duty bound to do in corroboration of his

allegations   against   the   management   in   this   regard   in   order   to

establish   the   factum   of   employee­employer   relationship   between

him and the management which is a pre­requisite for the grant of

any   relief   to   the  workman  against  the  management  in  the  instant

proceedings,  which  I find  has  not  been proved/established  by  the

workman in his instant Statement of claim  by way of his affidavit

Ex. WW1/A as also the documents Exts.WW1/1 to WW1/5 which

are copies of certain demand notices on behalf of the workman  to

the alleged management, in the absence of direct or corroborative

material   as   above   said   in   the   WE   in   the   instant   proceedings,   on

record.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                   It   is   thus   seen   from   the   record   that   the   affidavit

Ex.WW1/A   filed   by   the   workman   in   his   exparte   evidence   in   the

instant Statement of claim, on record, is merely a repetition of his


I.D. No. 108/07                                                    Page 4 out of 6
 allegations   in   the   same,   not   accompanied   by   any   corroborative

material by way of any appointment letter/work certificate/written

agreement or any other material which may go towards establishing

the   factum   of   the   employment   of   the   workman   with   the   alleged

management for the remuneration and period as alleged by him and

as   such   even   though   being   uncontroverted   and   unrebutted   is   not

carrying any weight or found sufficient to prove the allegations of

the workman against the respondent/management in this regard so as

to be entitled to any relief from this court on the basis of the same. It

is settled law that a plea is to be proved by a party who has set up the

same.  Therefore, undoubtedly the workman has to prove that he was

employed   by   the   respondent/management   as   well   as   the   wages

which were being drawn by him and the period for which he had

been employed.   In the instant case the workman filed an affidavit

by   way   of   evidence   and   closed   his   evidence.     Thus,   the   only

evidence in support of the plea of   employment is the self serving

affidavit filed by the workman and nothing beyond that to support

his claimed plea of service of 1 year and two months.  In view of the

principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Range Officer

Vs.   S.T   Hadimani,   II   (2002)   SLT   154   such   affidavit   by   itself   is

wholly   insufficient   to   discharge   the   burden   of   proof   on   the

workman. (2006 LLR 851 Automobile Association of Upper India


I.D. No. 108/07                                                   Page 5 out of 6
 vs. P.O. Labour Court II and Anr. refers).
</p>
<p id="p_3">                  In view of the above discussion as the workman has

failed to establish that there existed a relationship of employer and

employee between the workman and the management, the onus of

proving which was upon the workman, the workman is not entitled

to any relief in the instant statement of claim.

send six copies of this Award to the appropriate Government.  The

file be consigned to the record room. </p><pre id="pre_2">
