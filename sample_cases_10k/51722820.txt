Hon'ble Siddharth,J.
</pre> 
<p id="p_1">Supplementary affidavit filed today is taken on record. 
</p> 
<p id="p_2">Heard Sri V.M. Zaidi learned Senior Counsel assisted by Sri M. J. Akhtar, learned counsel for the applicant, Sri Sushil Kumar Pandey, learned counsel for the informant, learned AGA for the State and perused the material placed on record.
</p> 
<p id="p_3">The instant bail application has been filed on behalf of the applicant, Musawwar, with a prayer to release him on bail in Case Crime No. 782 of 2019, under <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_1">Sections 328</a>, <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_2">376</a> and <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_3">506</a> IPC, Police Station Kotwali City, District- Muzaffarnagar, during pendency of trial. 
</p> 
<p id="p_4">It is argued by the learned counsel for the applicant that victim is major and she is aged about 40 years. It has been submitted that implication of the applicant is after proceedings under under <a href="/doc/833310/" id="a_4">Section 156</a> (3) <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a>. Allegation against the applicant is that victim paid Rs.30,000/- to the applicant for the purpose of purchasing land from him, but he has not executed sale deed and had committed rape on her on 27.4.2019, when she went to give the amount to the applicant. It has further been submitted that there is discrepancy in different statements of the victim. The applicant alleges false implication. There is no documentary evidence evidencing payment of the amount or agreement for sale of the property and no detail of property has been mentioned. The applicant has criminal history of one case, which has been explained in paragraph No. 18 of the affidavit in support of the bail application and he is languishing in jail since 03.9.2019. In case, the applicant is released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail. 
</p> 
<p id="p_5">Per contra learned counsel for the informant and learned A.G.A. has opposed the prayer for bail of the applicant. Learned counsel for the informant has submitted that applicant took money from victim and also subjected her to the alleged offence and the land has also not been sold to her. It has further been submitted that applicant is influential person. Applicant has been implicated after proceedings under <a href="/doc/833310/" id="a_6">Section 156</a> (3) <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a>. The innocence of the applicant cannot be adjudged at pre trial stage, therefore, he does not deserves any indulgence. In case the applicant is released on bail he will again indulge in similar activities and will misuse the liberty of bail. 
</p> 
<p id="p_6">Having considered the submissions of the parties noted above, larger mandate of the <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_8">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India and the dictum of Apex Court in the case of Dataram Singh Vs. State of U.P. and another, reported in (2018) 3 SCC 22 and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, let the applicant involved in the aforesaid crime be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned with the following conditions that :-

</p> 
<p id="p_8">2. The applicant shall cooperate in the trial sincerely without seeking any adjournment.
</p> 
<p id="p_9">3. The applicant shall not indulge in any criminal activity or commission of any crime after being released on bail.
</p> 
<p id="p_10">In case, of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail.
</p> 
<p id="p_11">Identity, status and residence proof of the applicant and sureties be verified by the court concerned before the bonds are accepted. 
</p> 
<p id="p_12">Order Date :- 9.12.2019
