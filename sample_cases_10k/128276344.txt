       Khusboo Kumari, Lila Devi and Urmila Devi were murdered on

       8.8.2004 at about 3:30 a.m. in the paddy field of Yogendra

</p><p id="p_9">       3.                   The informant Nirmala Devi, P.W. 9, gave her

       fardbayan on 8.8.2004 at about 5:30 a.m. stating therein that

       at about 8 p.m. on the preceding evening one Foko Yadav was

       murdered. It has been alleged by the family members of Foko

       Yadav, that the persons of Rishideo Tola along with their

       supporters were responsible for the death of Foko Yadav. It is

       alleged that in order to take revenge, Sulo Mian, Natta Mian,

       Buchchi Mian, Lalit Yadav, elder son-in-law of Foko Yadav,

       Dinesh Yadav, Mustaq Mian, Shamshad Mian, Shaligram

       Singh, Bishwamohan Purve, Arvind Purve along with 15 other

       persons variously armed with weapons came to the village and

       began to search for the male members of the Tola. It is said

       that the men of the Tola began to run away, the informant

       Nirmala Devi, Lila Devi, Urmila Devi, Domni Devi, Khusboo

       Kumari and Mittan Rishideo were dragged to the field of

       Yogendra Rishideo. All of them were made to sit on the ground.

       Sialigram Singh is said to have ordered upon which all of them

       began to fire.         The informant claims that she managed to

       escape from the field, whereas others were killed. The reason

       for the said occurrence is that the landlord Indu Bhushan

       Choudhary had sold the lands situated at Madhepura which

       were occupied by the informant and others since a very long

       time.    This land was apparently under the Ceiling Act.         The

       informant claims that she along with others had got the lands

       settled in their favour.              It is alleged that Indu Bhushan

                                         5 / 21




       Choudhary had planned the entire occurrence and sold the

       land to the strong persons of the village. On the basis of the

       fardbeyan the First Information Report was instituted at 7:30

       a.m. and the investigation commenced in this case.

</p><p id="p_10">       4.                    During the trial, the appellants denied from

       participation in the occurrence and opted to be tried in this

       case.
</p>
<p id="p_11">       5.                     The question before this Court is whether the

       informant's case that she saw the occurrence is correct, and

       whether the witnesses can be believed with respect to their

       claim of being eye witnesses to the occurrence?

</p><p id="p_12">       6.               In this case, altogether eleven witnesses have been

       examined on behalf of the prosecution. As stated earlier, P.W. 9

       is the informant of this case and claims to be the eye witness.

       Apart from which, P.Ws. 2, 4, 5 and 6 also claim that they are

       eye witnesses in this case.                P.W. 1 Prithvi Prasad Yadav and

       P.W. 8 Kari Choudhary have been declared hostile. P.W. 3 is a

       formal witness whereas P.W. 7 is the hearsay witness. P.W. 10

       is the Investigating Officer of this case whereas, P.W. 11 is the

       doctor. Side by side also exhibited Ext. 1 series signature over

       inquest report, Ext. 2 fard-e-bayan, Ext. 3 series in quest report

       of respective doctors, Ext. 4 formal FIR, Ext. 5 series post

       mortem reports of respective deceased.
</p>
<p id="p_13">       7.                      This Court will examine the statement of the

       witnesses in Court in order to reach a finding as to whether the

                                         6 / 21




       prosecution has been able to prove the case beyond reasonable

       doubt? We shall start by discussing the evidence of P.W. 9 who

       is the informant of this case.              In her chief, she has tried to

       support the case as made out in the First Information Report.

       Her statement is that the occurrence took place in the manner

       described in the First Information Report. In her chief, she has

       improved her case by stating that apart from the victims

       mentioned earlier, one Geeta Devi was also dragged by the

       accused persons. She claims that when the accused asked the

       victims concerned to sit down in the field, Geeta Devi and P.W.

       9 did not sit down along with the rest. She claims that she and

       Geeta Devi escaped from the field. In her chief, she does not

       mention the names of Akhilesh, Jai Prakash and Arbind.                   In

       Court, she stated the names Lalit Yadav, Shamshad Mian, Sulo

       Mian,      Dinesh       Yadav,       Mushtaq        Mian,   Arbind   Purve,

       Bishwamohan Purve, Natta Mian, son-in-law of Foko Yadav and

       Buchchi Mian. In cross-examination, at paragraph 13, she has

       stated that her house is adjacent to the house of Yogendra

       Rishideo.      She claims that she was sleeping in the house of

       Yogendra Rishideo. She has tried to make out a case that all

       the deceased persons were sleeping in the aangan of Yogendra

       occurrence. It would appear from the description given by P.W.

       house of Yogendra Rishideo is intervened by Bilash Rishideo's

       house. At the same time, this witness has stated that she has a

       common aangan with the house of Yogendra, she claims that

       she has built a room, after the occurrence had taken place,

       opposite to the house of Yogendra Rishideo and both of them

       thus share a common aangan. In the cross-examination, it has

       been admitted that Foko Yadav was murdered prior to the

       occurrence and that Yogendra Rishideo, Binda &amp; others were

       arrested by the police. This witness also states that the Muslim

       Tola is at some distance from the Rishideo Tola. She admits

       that she never visited the Muslim Tola or spoken with the

       Muslims of that Tola. Regarding the motive for the occurrence,

       this witness admits that some persons have occupied the lands

       belonging to Saligram Singh. P.W. 9 claims that apart from the

       lands which have come under the Ceiling Act, the people of

       Rishideo Tola had occupied the lands on the basis of a

       settlement made by the ex-landlord. A suggestion has been put

       to this witness that the case has been instituted at the instance

       of Kartik Mukhiya. This witness has categorically admitted that

       the persons of Rishideo Tola work for Kartik Mukhiya. She also

       denies the suggestion that initially the statement of Urmila

       Devi, her 'Saut', was recorded by the police in which Urmila

       Devi has not named the miscreants.

       Report or in her statement before the Court. It also becomes

       apparent that this witness has tried to improve the case by

       including the name of Geeta Devi along with the persons who

       were dragged along with this witness to the field of Yogendra

       Rishideo. It is also clear that in order to explain that P.W. 9

       was present at the place of occurrence when the five deceased

       were dragged by the accused, she has made an attempt to show

       that they were all sleeping in one aangan. While describing the

       place of occurrence, she has specifically stated that Mittan has

       his hut just near the hut of Yogendra Rishideo. It would appear

       that all five of these persons have been placed together in order

       to   substantiate       the    prosecution        case    that   P.W.   9   and

       subsequently Geeta Devi P.W. 5 could be assigned the role of

       eye witness.

<p id="p_15">       9.             This Court finds it difficult to believe that all five

       persons should be sleeping in the aangan of Yogendra Rishideo.

       Apparently Geeta Devi was not sleeping along with these

       persons which is obvious, both from the First Information

       Report and the evidence that has come on record. It would also

       appear from paragraph 5 of the cross-examination that this

       witness could have not identify Natta Mian, Sulo Mian,

       Shamshad Mian and Mustaq Mian, as according to her she had

       never visited the Muslim Tola and, therefore, she had no means

       of knowing or identifying these four persons by name. It has

       been submitted that this witness could not be an eye witness to

       the occurrence, as the story weaved by her that she managed to

       escape from the field of Yogendra Rishideo along with Geeta

       Devi is unbelievable. There are eleven named accused persons

       who were present armed with rifle, guns and various other

       weapons along with 15 others, it cannot be expected that two

       women could have escaped from the clutches of the miscreants

       without there being any reaction on their part to apprehend

       these two ladies.

<p id="p_16">       10.                Having pointed out the glaring discrepancies that

       have been elicited after cross-examination of PW 9, the Court

       will examine the evidence of the three eye-witnesses i.e. PWs 2,

       4 and 7. The occurrence has taken place in two parts; the first

       with respect to allegedly witnessing the dragging of seven

       persons to the field of Yogendra Rishideo and the second part of

       the occurrence is the actual shooting of the five deceased

       persons. This Court may make it clear that as far as the first

       part of the occurrence is concerned, PW 9 and Geeta Devi (PW

</p><p id="p_17">       5) would be the eye-witnesses to the occurrence. On the other

       hand, PWs 9, 2, 4 and 7 are the eye-witnesses to the second

       part of the occurrence. It would, thus, become important to

       describe the place of occurrence as disclosed by the prosecution

       witnesses to determine whether they would be eye-witnesses to

       the occurrence in this case.

<p id="p_18">       11.            PW 9 describes the first place of occurrence in the

       following manner at paragraph 4 of her deposition. She claims

        that Jagdeo has an aangan; just west to the aangan is the

        village road whereas on the east side, there is a bamboo clump

        (Bans Kothi). On the south is the house of Bhinda Rishideo

        (victim). On the north side, there is the house of Zinda

        Rishideo. She further corrects herself and states that in the

        north, there is the house of Balo Rishideo and the house of

        Binda Rishideo is on the south. PW 9 is the wife of Balo

        Rishideo. She has also accepts that she has two minor children.

        She claims that there is an aangan in her house, which is north

        to south. On the north side of the house of Balo Rishideo, there

        is the house of Bilash Rishideo, which faces west and opens on

        the east side. There is an open field in front of the house of

        Balo, on the west of which, there is a bamboo clump and

        banana trees belonging to Balo Rishideo. Bilash Rishideo has

        also an aangan in his house which is 17-18 feet east-west and

        28-30 feet north-south. Bilash also has a bamboo clump near

        his aangan. North to the house of Bilash, there is the house of

        Yogendra Rishideo, which is the place from where the accused

        persons had dragged Mittan and others to the field of Yogendra

        Rishideo. South to the house of Yogendra is the house of

        Mahendra and south to the house of Mahendra is the house of

        Bima.      All   the    huts/houses         have     an   aangan   attached.

        Thereafter, the houses of other villagers after which there is a

        of occurrence had taken place. Near the house of Mittan

        (deceased), there is a road which goes towards the east and the

        house of Lalit which again has a bamboo clump. This witness

        goes on to say that there are 60-75 houses near the road which

        goes towards Murliganj. PW 9 has her hut/house south of the

        house of Bilash Rishideo.
</p>
<p id="p_19">        12.         From the above description of the place of occurrence,

        it is clear that the aangan of Yogendra Rishideo and Bilash

        Rishideo are next to each other whereas, the house of P.W. 9 is

        one house away from the house and Aangan of Yogendra

        Rishideo. The question that remains unanswered, is that the

        prosecution has not been able to explain why this witness (PW

</p><p id="p_20">        9) was sleeping in the aangan of Yogendra Rishideo, especially

        as she has two minor children who were admittedly not with

        her at the time of occurrence, from where Mittan, Domni Devi,

        Leela Devi, Urmila Devi and Khusboo Kumari were dragged by

        the miscreants. She admits that she has built her hut with an

        aangan adjacent to the house of Yogendra Rishideo during the

        pendency of the trial. Therefore, this Court finds it difficult to

        believe that PW 9 could have been an eye-witness to the

        dragging of the deceased persons from the aangan of Yogendra

        Rishideo. This aspect of the matter will further be supported by

        the fact that the deceased Mittan Rishideo, his wife Domni Devi

        and daughter Khusboo Kumari had a hut and aangan which is

        adjacent to the hut of Yogendra Rishideo. Leela Devi, the

        deceased, is the wife of Yogendra Rishideo. It is thus

        understandable that these four persons could have been

        dragged from the aangan of Yogendra Rishideo and Mittan

        Rishideo because there aangans are situated just adjacent to

        each other at a distance of 20-30 feet. The presence of Nirmila

        Devi in the house of Yogendra Rishideo has not been explained.

        It may be pointed out that the Investigating Officer who has

        been examined as PW 10 has not described the first place of

        occurrence and, therefore, this Court has only the evidence of

        PW 9 to determine the topography of the place of occurrence

        aforesaid.
</p>
<p id="p_21">        13.               The second place of occurrence is where the actual

        murder took place, which is the field of Yogendra Rishideo. In

        the evidence of the Investigating Officer, it has specifically been

        mentioned that north to the field of Yogendra Rishideo, is the

        village road which is east to west. In the south side, is the

        uncultivated land of Sita Ram Rishideo. On the east is the

        uncultivated field of Bilash Rishideo and on the west side, is the

        half constructed house of Mittan Rishideo.

        witnesses regarding this aspect of the matter.

        examination-in-chief, he identified all except Arbind Purve. At

        paragraph 2, this witness has stated that he was examined by

        the Police 4-5 days after the occurrence had taken place. He

        claimed that he has specifically stated before the Police that

        Sulo Mian, Natta Mian, Mustaq Mian had fired on the deceased

        persons. He had not stated the names of others before the

        Investigating Officer. According to this witness, he has his

        house near the road. He has about 24 bighas of land and his

        house is built on 1.25 bighas of land. He claimed that he heard

        the sound of firing and hid himself along with his mother and

        wife in the bamboo clump from where he had seen the

        occurrence. He has specifically stated at paragraph 7 of his

        deposition that his land has been purchased by Saligram,

        Mustaq Mian, Buchchi Mian, Shamshad Mian and the son-in-

        law of Foko Yadav. On reading the evidence of this witness, it is

        quite clear that his house and field is situated quite far from the

        place of occurrence and it is not acceptable that he could have

        identified, and specifically assigned roles to the persons who

        were present at the time of occurrence. There is a discrepancy

        even in the identification and statement made before the

        Investigating Officer. In his examination-in-chief, he claimed to

        have identified all persons                by naming them and also claimed

        to have identified Saligram Babu (not put up trial as

        investigation is still pending against him) by his voice as the

        order giver. His examination after 4-5 days before the Police has

        been questioned by the Counsel for the appellants. The

        contradiction made by him and the fact that he has admitted

        that his land have been purchased by the persons named above

        indicates that he could not have seen the occurrence from the

        distance where his house is situated more so as there was no

        means of identification. As such, the claim of PW 2 as an eye-

        witness cannot be substantiated and creates doubt regarding

        the veracity of the statements made by PW 2.

</p><p id="p_24">        16.            The next eye-witness to the occurrence is Jasia Devi,

        PW 4. She claimed that she was sleeping in her house when 10-

        25 persons (i.e. the appellants) came and began to pull away

        people from their houses. They took away the deceased persons

        and killed them in the field of Yogendra Rishideo. She also

        disclosed the motive of the said occurrence. This witness has

        misidentified Arbind Purve by calling him Shamshad, later she

        identified Arbind, but not Shamshad. She had misidentified

        Manoj Yadav, son-in-law of Foko Yadav by calling him Lalit.

        Thus, this witness has misidentified Lalit Yadav, son-in-law of

        Foko Yadav i.e. Manoj Yadav and Shamshad Mian. The later

        identification of Arbind is also doubtful. At paragraph 9 of the

        deposition, she has specifically stated that she got up when she

        heard the sound of firing and hid herself, with her family

        behind the bamboo clump. Thus, the evidence of this witness

        becomes unreliable in view of her statement at paragraph 9 of

        the deposition. It is also difficult to believe her statement that

        she could see the occurrence from where her house was

        situated, which appears to be at some distance from the field of

        Yogendra Rishideo. Her house has not been shown in the

        vicinity of the house of PW 9, the informant. PW 9 has not

        mentioned that Jasia Devi, wife of Late Saryug Rishideo has her

        hut/house near the house of Yogendra Rishideo. Special

        attention has also been drawn to the fact that the statement of

        Jasia Devi was recorded by the Investigating Officer along with

        the statements of Janaki Devi and Girja Devi at one place. In

        other words, the Investigating Officer has not recorded their

        statements       separately.      It   has     also       been   stated   by   the

        Investigating Officer that they had not named the accused

        persons separately; in fact the Investigating Officer merely

        states that they said the same thing as was stated by Geeta

        Devi in her statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_14">Section 161</a> of the Code of

        Criminal Procedure. This Court on the basis of the aforesaid

        discussions finds that in fact this witness had neither seen the

        first part of the occurrence nor the second part of the

        occurrence and as such, she cannot be said to be reliable on

        the point of identification of the persons who are responsible for

        the said occurrence.

        witness to the occurrence. According to this witness, she has

        also been dragged to the field of Yogendra Rishideo. She

        claimed that she escapes from the field and hid herself along

        with Nirmala Devi. She misidentified Natta Mian by calling him

        Dinesh, she identified Nattu Mian by calling him Sulo. Sulo

        Mian      was     identified      as       Mustaq    Mian.   She   identified

        Bishwamohan Purve as Arbind Purve. She called Arbind Purve

        as son-in-law of Foko and Shamshad Mian was identified as

        Bishwamohan Purve.
</p>
<p id="p_26">        18.            The fact that PW 9, the informant, has not said that

        Geeta Devi was also dragged by the miscreants in the field of

        Yogendra Rishideo in the First Information Report, raises doubt

        with respect to the evidence of this witness. This witness claims

        that she hid herself along with Nirmala Devi (PW 9). She claims

        that she hid herself in the house of Mittan Rishideo, whereas

        the claim of PW 9 is that they were hiding in the bamboo clamp.

        This witness is also not reliable because she has not been able

        to identify as many as nine accused persons. The story of

        escaping from the field of Yogendra Rishideo is impossible to

        believe for the same reasons as it is difficult to believe that PW

        9 could have escaped from the clutches of the accused persons,

        especially as there were open space in the three sides of the

        place of occurrence and it was the accused persons who were

        carrying torches, and were variously armed with weapons.

        to have seen the accused persons dragging the three ladies and

        Mittan Rishideo to the field of Yogendra Rishideo. PW 6 claims

        to have seen the occurrence by hiding behind the lemon tree,

        which is allegedly situated near the field of Yogendra Rishideo.

        His evidence at paragraph 7 of the deposition is sufficient to

        lead this Court to conclude, that in fact, he could not have seen

        any part of the occurrence, where he states that between the

        lemon tree and the place of occurrence, there are two houses

        which intervene between the field of Yogendra Rishideo (place of

        occurrence) and the place where this witness was hiding to see

        the occurrence.
</p>
<p id="p_28">        20.                      Having analyzed the evidence of all the eye-

        witnesses in this case, this Court come to the conclusion that

        the testimonies of PW 9 and PW 5 who are said to be the eye-

        witnesses to both parts of the occurrence, in fact cannot be

        believed for the reasons as follows:- (a) PW 9 has her own house

        and two minor children and, therefore, it cannot be believed

        that she would leave her children alone and go to the house of

        Yogendra Rishideo to spend the night. (b) It is also not

        acceptable that she could have escaped from the field of

        Yogendra Rishideo along with Geeta Devi (PW 5). The later part

        is an addition and the development made in the prosecution

        case, as Nirmala Devi (PW 9) has not been mentioned this fact

        in the First Information Report. (c) Similarly, it is difficult for

        this Court to believe that these ladies could have identified the

        accused persons by names, which is also apparent from the

        misidentification made by PW 5. (d) Regarding the muslim

        accused persons, it has been admitted by PW 9 that she had no

        occasion to meet them or talk to them or even visit their Tola or

        see them in the market place. Under such circumstances, this

        Court finds it difficult to believe that she could have identified

        these persons by names. The prosecution case developed by

        PWs 9 and 5 regarding identification is unreliable.                  The

        identification and version of P.W. 9 and P.W. 5 may be

        examined from another angle.                  Since, this Court finds the

        prosecution version that P.W. 9 and P.W. 5 escaped from the

        clutches of the accused persons, they could not have been eye

        witness to the first part of the occurrence. If, in fact they were

        dragged to the open field of Yogendra Rishideo, then there was

        no way that they could have escaped and saved themselves,

        especially as the witnesses have stated that the appellants were

        carrying torches.

        in which five persons were killed, what has been argued is that

        these persons who are not known to the prosecution witnesses

        4 &amp; 5, or for that matter PW 9, could have identified them in

        the late night without any means of identification unless they

        had any special knowledge and occasion to know the accused

        persons. This Court takes into consideration that prosecution

        witnesses 2, 4 and 5 have altogether misidentified 09 accused

        persons i.e. Lalit Yadav, Sulo Mian, Shamshad Mian, Nakta

        Mian, Dinesh Yadav, Bishwamohan Purve, Arbind Purve and

        Manoj Yadav and, therefore, finds that they cannot be convicted

        on the basis of their evidence whereas this Court has already

        discussed the other reasons for not relying on these eye-

        witnesses, while discussing their evidence earlier in this

        judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_30">        22.              Another good reason for not believing the evidence

        of PWs 2, 4, 5 and 9 is that none of the witnesses have

        disclosed the source of identification. They have not stated that

        it was a moonlit night or that it was a dark night. This is

        another factor which would lead this Court to disbelieve their

        evidence.

<p id="p_31">        23.                   The defence raised on behalf of the appellants

        which has been disclosed by way of suggestions put to the

        witnesses, is that, the witnesses have named the accused

        persons out of enmity. They deny that there was a ceiling

        proceeding. They have been made accused on the basis of the

        fact that they are bona fide purchasers and are in possession of

        the land. It has been suggested that the appellants have been

        named at the instance of Kartik Yadav. The persons of Rishideo

        Tola work for Kartik Yadav who bears enmity with these

        appellants. The defence has led evidence by examining DWs 1,

        2 and 3. The defence witnesses have been examined to show

        that in fact accused Lalit Yadav was present on the night of

        occurrence. The witnesses have also stated that Kartik Yadav

        had ensured through his Bataidars to rope in the accused

        persons. Some of whom had purchased land of Indu Bhushan.

        Apparently Kartik Yadav wanted to purchase the land of Indu

        Bhushan but for some reason he was unsuccessful and as such

        he got the case instituted.

<p id="p_32">        24.                    Learned counsel for the State has argued that

        these cases would be covered by the judgment of the Supreme

        court in the case <a href="/doc/32790580/" id="a_15">Masalti vs. State of U.P</a>., AIR 1965 SC 202,

        according to which the court ought to believe the identification

        if two reliable witnesses claim to have identified the persons

        participating in a case of rioting or for that matter in case, such

        as, the present one. The main issue is that the court must find

        that the evidence of the witnesses is reliable. Once this court

        has held for various reasons that the witnesses cannot be relied

        upon to substantiate the case made out by them in the First

        Information Report and through their evidence, the question of

        believing the identification of such witnesses does not arise.

        Besides which in a case of rioting/carnage, the mob is divided

        into groups, which indulge in acts of arson and murder at

        different places, and is not possible that every witness can see,

        all parts of the occurrence.

<p id="p_33">        25.                      It may be clarified that the examination of

        witnesses lead this court to the conclusion that the evidence of

        the eye witnesses in this case, is not reliable and in fact, could

        not have identified the accused persons. In the circumstances

        this court cannot conclude that the accused persons named in
