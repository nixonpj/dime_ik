</pre>
<p id="p_1">        Heard the learned Counsel on either side and perused the documents 
placed on record.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2. According to the petitioners, the subject properties belong to them
and as such, they are all acquired by the second respondent for National
Highways project. For the said acquisition, compensation amount was fixed and
the same was also awarded. Being dissatisfied with the compensation awarded, 
all the petitioners have, individually, submitted representations on
29.05.2018, followed by reminders dated 15.09.2018, seeking enhancement of 
compensation; alternate place for survival; and Government job to anyone of
their family members. As no response is forthcoming, they are before this
Court.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3. Learned Government Advocate, on instructions, would submit that the
acquisition proceedings were carried out as per law and compensation amount
was also fixed. If the petitioners are not satisfied with the compensation
awarded, as per <a href="/doc/1163443/" id="a_2">Section 3(G)</a><a href="/doc/1713036/" id="a_3">5</a> of the National Highways Act, they have to
prefer an application before the Arbitrator, being the District Collector /
first respondent in this case, for enhancing the compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4. At this juncture, learned Counsel for the petitioners submitted that
since the petitioners have already submitted their representations seeking
enhancement, the first respondent / District Collector shall be directed to
dispose of the same, within a stipulated time limit.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and also taking
into account the limited scope of the relief sought for, these writ petitions
are disposed of, with a direction to the petitioners to enclose a copy of
their representations along with a copy of this order to the first
respondent, within a period of two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy
of this order. On receipt of the same, the first respondent shall consider
the same and pass appropriate orders, on merits and in accordance with law,
after affording due opportunity of personal hearing to the parties concerned,
within a period of six weeks thereafter. No costs.
