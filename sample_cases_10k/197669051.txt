C.M.A.(MD)No.867 of 2017

C.M.P.(MD) No.9276 of 2017  


1.Veeraswamy  
2.Pradeep Kumar

Vs.


Kamalam                                                 ... Respondent        

Prayer: Appeal filed under Order 43 Rule 1(r) of C.P.C to set aside the fair
and decreetal order passed in I.A.No.256 of 2016 in O.S.No.53 of 2016 dated
19.10.2016 on the file of the Learned District Judge, Kanyakumari District at
Nagercoil.

!For Appellants         : Mr.G.Ramanathan  

^For Respondent         : Mr.S.Sivakumar         
                                        

:JUDGMENT   
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        The respondent herein filed O.S.No.53 of 2016 on the file of the
District Judge, Kanyakumari District at Nagercoil, seeking the relief of
declaration and injunction in respect of the suit property.  The appellants
in this civil miscellaneous appeal are defendants in the said suit.
</p><p id="p_2">        2.The respondent's husband Ramasamy and the 1st  appellant herein are 
brothers.  They jointly filed O.S.No.279 of 2003 on the file of the District
Munsif, Kuzhithurai, seeking relief of partition and separate possession.
The suit schedule property in O.S.No.53 of 2016 was one of the items in the
suit schedule property of O.S.No.279 of 2003.  The husband of the respondent
along with the 1st appellant Veerasamy sought allocation of 1/3rd share.
Preliminary decree was passed in the said suit. Final decree was also passed
on 04.12.2013.   It is seen that thereafter the said Ramasamy executed
settlement deed dated 09.09.2015 in favour of the respondent herein.  Based
on the said settlement deed, the present suit for declaration and injunction
has been laid.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.The case of the respondent herein is based on the assignment of the
mortgage deed of the year 1976 in his favour.  But there is no whisper about
the said mortgage, when the respondent's husband along with the 1st appellant
filed the partition suit in the year 2003.  But, the Trial Court took note of
the fact that counter was not filed in spite of  grant of sufficient
opportunity.  On this score, the interim injunction earlier granted was made
absolute by order dated 19.10.2016.  It is this that is challenged in this
civil miscellaneous appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5.It is true that the appellants herein did not file any counter before
the Court below. But on that sole ground, I am not inclined to sustain the
order passed by the Trial Judge granting injunction in favour of the
respondent herein.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        6.I went through the materials on record.  They are enclosed in the
typed set.  The authenticity of the same cannot be impeached.  It is seen
that the respondent's husband was a co-plaintiff with the 1st appellant
herein.  They have jointly filed  the partition suit in O.S.No.279 of 2003.
Final decree came to be passed on 04.12.2013.  The subject matter of the
present injunction application was one of the suit items which was
partitioned.  When the suit item had already been partitioned, the husband of
the respondent could not have executed the settlement deed on 09.09.2015 
after the final decree was passed.  That apart the husband of the respondent
and the 1st appellant herein are brothers.  The 2nd respondent and the 3rd
appellant are the sons of Thankaswamy, who was the defendant in O.S.No.279 of 
2003.  Thus originally they have been co-owners.   Of course, after partition
there has been severance of status of co-ownership. If the final decree in
O.S.No.279/2003 is to be ignored, there cannot be an injunction against co-
owners.  If the said final decree is accepted, then the validity of the
settlement deed dated 09.09.2015 becomes doubtful.  The respondent is in a
catch-22 situation.  I have, therefore, no option, but to set aside the order
dated 19.10.2016 made in I.A.No.256 of 2016 in O.S.No.53 of 2016.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        7.Accordingly, I.A.No.256 of 2016 in O.S.No.53 of 2016 stands
dismissed.  It is however made clear that the Trial Judge shall dispose of
the suit uninfluenced by the reasoning or finding given in this order.  The
findings set out above are only for the limited purpose of deciding this I.A.
With this clarification, this Civil Miscellaneous Appeal stands allowed.  No
costs.  Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
