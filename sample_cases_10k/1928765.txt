</p><p id="p_2">            2.    By these applications filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C., the
            petitioners have prayed for quashing the order dated 8.1.2007
            passed by Sessions Judge, Deoghar in Criminal Revision No.170 of
            2006 whereby he has dismissed the revision which was filed for
            setting aside the order dated 6.7.2006 passed by S.D.J.M., Deoghar
            in P.C.R. Case No.192 of 2003 taking cognizance of the offence
            under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_2">Section 420</a> I.P.C.
</p><p id="p_3">            3.    The complainant-O.P. No.2 filed Complaint Case being
            P.C.R. Case No.192 of 2003 in the Court of C.J.M, Deoghar against
            the petitioners and others alleging inter alia that one Mahabir
            Prasad Khowala was holding registered Power of Attorney on
            behalf of Jugal Kishore Khowala in respect of the land in question
            and on the basis of the said Power of Attorney, he entered into an
            agreement of sale of the entire lands with Krishna Mohan Chaubey
            and the complainant. The said Power of Attorney holder received
            entire consideration amount of Rs. 20 Lakhs from the complainant.
            As per the agreement of sale, it was agreed inter alia that the owner
            Jugal Kishore Khowala will extend full cooperation and the power
            of attorney holder shall execute necessary sale deeds. The
            agreement for sale was witnessed by petitioners Savitri Devi
            Khowala and Dinesh Kumar Khowala. Further allegation was that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2</span>


              when the complainant and his co-purchaser started negotiating for
              execution of sale deed, they came to know that one Vinod Kumar
              Khowala was having a Power of Attorney duly executed by the
              original owner. It further revealed that on the basis of the said
              Power of Attorney, Vinod Kumar Khowala executed agreement for
              sale in the name of different persons. It was alleged that when the
              complainant approached Mahabir Prasad Khowala in his residence
              and wanted to know why such fraud was played upon them, the
              accused persons did not give proper response. All the accused
              persons said to have members of the same family and they alleged
              to have committed fraud upon the complainant.
</p><p id="p_4">              4.    On the basis of the allegation made in the complaint petition
              coupled with the statements recorded on Solemn Affirmation, the
              Chief Judicial Magistrate took cognizance of the offence under
              <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_3">Section 420</a> I.P.C. The said order was challenged before the Sessions
              Judge in Criminal Revision. The learned Sessions Judge after
              considering the complaint petition and the evidence brought on
              record, found that prima facie case of fraud was made out and
              consequently, revision application was dismissed.
</p><p id="p_5">              5.    It has not been disputed by the petitioners that on the basis
              of power of attorney, the power of attorney holder entered into an
              agreement with the complainant and received a sum of Rs.20 Lakhs
              and again power of attorney was executed in respect of the same
              land and on the basis of another power of attorney, the same land
              was being transferred to other persons by entering into an
              agreement. Prima facie case of fraud has been made out on the
              basis of allegation and the evidence brought on record. In my view,
              therefore, it would not be proper at this stage to interfere with the
              order passed by the Court below and to quash the same in exercise
              of power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_4">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_6">                           For the reasons aforesaid, the applications are
              dismissed.
