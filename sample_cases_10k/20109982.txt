Per: Rajendra Menon, Acting Chief Justice:

<p id="p_3">02.          Petitioners/students prosecuting a course studying in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  2</span>

L.L.B. from Government Law College, Dewas have filed this writ

petition and it is their grievance that in the examination conducted

for the second semester in the subject of Jurisprudence and Family

Law, they were declared as failed. Thereafter they were declared as

failed in the subject of Law Relating to Equity and Trust and

Labour Law in the fourth semester. They sought revaluation or

rechecking of answer sheets for the aforesaid subjects in which

they failed in the second and fourth semester. As no change in the

marks were indicated to them, they filed this writ petition seeking

a mandamus to appoint an independent examiner for rechecking of

their answer sheets in the subject for rechecking. They further want

direction to permit them to appear in the fifth semester

examination.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">03.        Except making vague allegations to say that their

answer sheets in the failed subjects were not valued properly no

material is adduced before us to show as to what is the error in the

valuation done by the experts. Revaluation of answer sheets are

done only if statutory rules permit so. In the absence of statutory

provision being available no mandamus can be issued for

revaluation of the answer sheets. This is settled principle of law

and in this regard reference can be made to the judgment of this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   3</span>

Court in the case of Neha Indurkhya Vs. Board of Secondary

Education, Bhopal reported in 2003 (3) MPLJ 368 and various

other cases. That being so, for directing revaluation of the answer

sheets in question petitioners are required to demonstrate by

adducing prima facie material that the revaluation have been done

in arbitrary, negligent or callous manner. In the absence of all these

factors being not established revaluation cannot be directed by this

Court. That being so, for the present we see not case made out for

directing revaluation.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">04.        However, now in view of the law laid down by the

Supreme Court in the case of Central Board of Secondary

Education and another Vs. Aditya Bandopadhaya and others

reported in (2011) 8 SCC 497, the petitioners can obtain the

answer sheets under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_1">Information Act</a> and based on the

same can point out errors, if any, in the valuation to the examining

Authority and it is for the examining Authority to consider the

grievance of the petitioner with regard to revaluation and take a

decision in the matter. However, even after such representation the

petitioners have any grievance still subsisting they may seek

recourse to such remedy as may be available under law for

ventilating their grievance.

present finding no case is made out. Accordingly, the petitions

stand dismissed.
