<p id="p_1">L...I...T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J

R.C. Lahoti, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_3">    On	4.3.1983,  the plaintiff-appellant filed a suit	 for
declaration of title and recovery of possession and issuance
of permanent preventive injunction restraining the defendant
from  interfering with the possession of the plaintiff	over
the  suit  property  described as khasra No.41/1  area	1.09
acres  (0.441  hectares)  situated   in	 Village   Patharia,
District  Damoh.  According to the plaintiff, the  defendant
had illegally dispossessed the plaintiff from his possession
over  110x80  ft.  area of land out of the suit property  on
20.8.1981.   The  defendant in his written statement  denied
all  material  averments and in addition submitted that	 the
defendant  has been in possession of the suit property since
1940-41,  i.e.	 since the times of his grand  father.	 The
suit  filed by the plaintiff was alleged to have been barred
by  limitation	in view of the same having been	 filed	more
than  12  years	 after	the date  of  dispossession  of	 the
plaintiff.  A plea of the defendant having acquired title by
adverse possession was also raised in the written statement.
</p>

<p id="p_4">    The	  trial	 Court,	 on  an	  evaluation  of  oral	 and
documentary  evidence  adduced	by the parties,	 found	that
ownership  in the suit property vested in the plaintiff	 and
the  defendant	had forcibly occupied the disputed  area  of
110x80	ft.  sometime in the year 1980-81.  The	 defendants
plea  of adverse possession was negatived and the suit filed
by  the	 plaintiff  was held to have been filed	 within	 the
period	of  limitation.	  On  these findings  the  suit	 was
decreed in its entirety.
</p>
<p id="p_5">    The	  defendant  preferred	an   appeal.   The   learned
additional  district Judge held that in so far as  ownership
over  the  suit	 land is concerned, the same vested  in	 the
plaintiff.   However,  he found that the possession  of	 the
land  was given to the plaintiff by the State Government  on
6.11.68	 but  the plaintiff has not shown to have taken	 any
steps for dispossessing the defendant and the plea raised by
the  plaintiff of the defendant having forcibly occupied the
land  in dispute on 20.8.1981 did not appear to be  tenable.
On  these findings the appeal was allowed and in reversal of
the  judgment  and  decree of the trial Court the  suit	 was
directed to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">    The	 plaintiff preferred a second appeal which has	been
dismissed  in limine by the High Court passing a brief order
that  the matter stood concluded by findings of fact and  no
substantial  question  of law arose for determination.	 The
aggrieved plaintiff has filed this appeal by special leave.
</p>
<p id="p_7">    On 4.5.1999 this Court directed a notice to be issued to
the  defendant-respondent on the limited question as to	 why
the  matter  should  not be remanded to the High  Court	 for
deciding the appeal after framing the question of law.
</p>
<p id="p_8">    We	have  heard the learned counsel for the parties	 and
perused	 the  judgments	 of the trial Court  and  the  first
appellate Court.  We have also perused the application dated
12.1.2001   filed   in	this  Court   on   behalf   of	 the
plaintiff-appellant setting out the substantial questions of
law  which in his submission arose in the case and on  which
the High Court ought to have heard the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_9">    What  is  a substantial question of law involved in	 the
case?	Section	 100  of the Code of Civil  Procedure,	1908
(hereinafter,  the code, for short) as substituted by  the
Code  of  <a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_1">Civil Procedure Amendment Act</a>, 1976 (104 of  1976)
w.e.f.	1.2.1977 reads as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_10">		100.	  Second Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_11">    (1)	 Save as otherwise expressly provided in the body of
this  Code or by any other law for the time being in  force,
an  appeal  shall  lie to the High Court from  every  decree
passed in appeal by any Court subordinate to the High Court,
if  the	 High  Court is satisfied that the case	 involves  a
substantial question of law.
</p>
<p id="p_12">    (2)	 An  appeal  may  lie under  this  section  from  an
appellate decree passed ex parte.
</p>
<p id="p_13">    (3)	 In an appeal under this section, the memorandum  of
appeal shall precisely state the substantial question of law
involved in the appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_14">    (4) Where the High Court is satisfied that a substantial
question  of law is involved in any case, it shall formulate
that question.
</p>
<p id="p_15">    (5)	 The  appeal  shall  be heard  on  the	question  so
formulated  and the respondent shall, at the hearing of	 the
appeal,	 be allowed to argue that the case does not  involve
such question:
</p>
<p id="p_16">    Provided  that  nothing  in this  sub-section  shall  be
deemed	to  take away or abridge the power of the  Court  to
hear,  for  reasons to be recorded, the appeal on any  other
substantial  question of law, not formulated by it, if it is
satisfied that the case involves such question.
</p>
<p id="p_17">    The	 High  Court cannot proceed to hear a second  appeal
without formulating the substantial question of law involved
in  the	 appeal and if it does so it acts illegally  and  in
abnegation  or	abdication of the duty cast on	Court.	 The
existence of substantial question of law is the sine qua non
for  the  exercise  of the jurisdiction	 under	the  amended
<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_2">Section	 100</a> of the Code.  [See Kshitish Chandra Purkait Vs.
Santosh	 Kumar Purkait &amp; Ors., (1997) 5 SCC 438, Panchugopal
Barua  Vs.   Umesh  Chandra Goswami, (1997) 4  SCC  713	 and
Kondila	 Dagadu	 Kadam Vs.  Savitribai Sopan Gujar  &amp;  Ors.,
(1999) 3 SCC 722].
</p>
<p id="p_18">    At	the  very outset we may point out that the  memo  of
second	appeal	filed by the plaintiff-appellant before	 the
High  Court suffered from a serious infirmity.	<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_3">Section	 100</a>
of  the Code, as amended in 1976, restricts the jurisdiction
of  the	 High  Court  to  hear	 a  second  appeal  only  on
substantial  question  of  law involved in the	case.	An
obligation  is	cast on the appellant to precisely state  in
the  memorandum	 of appeal the substantial question  of	 law
involved  in the appeal and which the appellant proposes  to
urge  before  the  High	 Court.	  The  High  Court  must  be
satisfied  that a substantial question of law is involved in
the  case and such question has then to be formulated by the
High  Court.   Such  questions or question may	be  the	 one
proposed by the appellant or may be any other question which
though	not proposed by the appellant yet in the opinion  of
the  High  Court  arises  as involved in  the  case  and  is
substantial  in	 nature.  At the hearing of the appeal,	 the
scope  of  hearing  is	circumscribed  by  the	question  so
formulated  by the High Court.	The respondent is at liberty
to  show that the question formulated by the High Court	 was
not  involved  in  the	case.  In  spite  of  a	 substantial
question  of law determining the scope of hearing of  second
appeal	having been formulated by the High Court, its  power
to hear the appeal on any other substantial question of law,
not  earlier formulated by it, is not taken away subject  to
the  twin  conditions being satisfied:	(i) the	 High  Court
feels  satisfied  that the case involves such question,	 and
</p><p id="p_19">(ii)   the  High  Court	 records   reasons  for	  its	such
satisfaction.
</p>
<p id="p_20">    Even  under	 the old <a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_4">Section 100</a> of the  Code  (pre-1976
amendment), a pure finding of fact was not open to challenge
before	the  High Court in second appeal.  However  the	 Law
Commission  noticed a plethora of conflicting judgments.  It
noted  that in dealing with second appeals, the Courts	were
devising and successfully adopting several concepts such as,
a  mixed  question of fact and law, a legal inference to  be
drawn  from  facts proved, and even the point that the	case
has  not been properly approached by the Courts below.	This
was  creating confusion in the minds of the public as to the
legitimate  scope  of  second  appeal under  S.100  and	 had
burdened  the High Courts with an unnecessarily large number
of second appeals.  <a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_5">Section 100</a> was, therefore, suggested to
be  amended so as to provide that the right of second appeal
should	be  confined  to cases where a question	 of  law  is
involved  and  such  question of law is a  substantial	one.
(See   Statement  of  Objects	and  Reasons).	 The  Select
Committee to which the Amendment Bill was referred felt that
the  scope  of second appeals should be restricted  so	that
litigations  may not drag on for a long period.	 Reasons, of
course,	 are  not required to be stated for formulating	 any
question  of law under sub-section(4) of <a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_6">Section 100</a> of	 the
Code;	though such reasons are to be recorded under proviso
to  sub-section	 (5) while exercising power to hear  on	 any
other  substantial  question  of  law, other  than  the	 one
formulated under sub- section(4).
</p>

<p id="p_21">    The	 phrase substantial question of law, as	 occurring
in  the amended <a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_7">Section 100</a> is not defined in<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_8"> the Code</a>.	 The
word  substantial, as qualifying question of law, means	 -
of  having  substance,	essential,  real,  of  sound  worth,
important  or  considerable.   It  is to  be  understood  as
something  in  contradistinction  with -  technical,  of  no
substance  or consequence, or academic merely.	However,  it
is  clear that the Legislature has chosen not to qualify the
scope  of  substantial	question of law by  suffixing  the
words of general importance as has been done in many other
provisions  such  as  <a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_9">Section  109</a> of the  Code	 or  <a href="/doc/780609/" id="a_10">Article
133(1)(a)</a>  of the Constitution.	 The substantial question of
law  on	 which	a  second appeal shall	be  heard  need	 not
necessarily  be	 a  substantial question of law	 of  general
importance.   In Guran Ditta &amp; Anr.  Vs.  T.  Ram Ditta, AIR
1928  Privy Council 172, the phrase substantial question of
law  as	 it  was employed in the last clause  of  the  then
existing  Section  110 of the C.P.C.  (since omitted by	 the
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_11">Amendment  Act</a>,	 1973) came up for consideration  and  Their
Lordships  held that it did not mean a substantial  question
of  general  importance	 but a substantial question  of	 law
which  was involved in the case as between the parties.	  <a href="/doc/1681739/" id="a_12">In
Sir  Chunilal  V.   Mehta  &amp; Sons  Ltd.	  Vs.	The  Century
Spinning  and Manufacuring Co., Ltd</a>., (1962) Supp.3 SCR 549,
the   Constitution  Bench  expressed   agreement  with	 the
following view taken by a Full Bench of Madras High Court in
Rimmalapudi  Subba  Rao Vs.  Noony Veeraju, ILR 1952  Madras
264:-
</p>
<p id="p_22">    ..when  a question of law is fairly arguable,  where
there  is room for difference of opinion on it or where	 the
Court  thought	it necessary to deal with that	question  at
some  length and discuss alternative view, then the question
would  be a substantial question of law.  On the other	hand
if  the question was practically covered by the decision  of
the highest Court or if the general principles to be applied
in  determining	 the question are well settled and the	only
question  was of applying those principles to the particular
fact  of the case it would not be a substantial question  of
law.
</p>

<p id="p_23">    and	 laid  down the following test as proper  test,	 for
determining  whether a question of law raised in the case is
substantial:-
</p>
<p id="p_24">     The  proper test for determining whether a question  of
law raised in the case is substantial would, in our opinion,
be  whether it is of general public importance or whether it
directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties
and if so whether it is either an open question in the sense
that it is not finally settled by this Court or by the Privy
Council	 or  by	 the  Federal  Court or	 is  not  free	from
difficulty or calls for discussion of alternative views.  If
the  question is settled by the highest Court or the general
principles  to	be applied in determining the  question	 are
well  settled and there is a mere question of applying those
principles  or	that the plea raised is palpably absurd	 the
question would not be a substantial question of law.
</p>
<p id="p_25">    In	Deputy	Commr.,	 Hardoi, in charge Court  of  Wards,
Bharawan Estate Vs.  Rama Krishna Narain &amp; Ors., AIR 1953 SC
521,  also it was held that a question of law of  importance
to  the parties was a substantial question of law  entitling
the appellant to certificate under (the then) <a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_13">Section 110</a> of
the Code.
</p>
<p id="p_26">    A  point of law which admits of no two opinions may be a
proposition  of law but cannot be a substantial question  of
law.   To  be  substantial,  a question	 of  law  must	be
debatable,  not	 previously settled by law of the land or  a
binding	 precedent, and must have a material bearing on	 the
decision  of the case, if answered either way, in so far  as
the  rights of the parties before it are concerned.  To be a
question  of law involving in the case there must be first
a  foundation for it laid in the pleadings and the  question
should	emerge from the sustainable findings of fact arrived
at by court of facts and it must be necessary to decide that
question  of law for a just and proper decision of the case.
An  entirely new point raised for the first time before	 the
High  Court is not a question involved in the case unless it
goes  to the root of the matter.  It will, therefore, depend
on  the	 facts	and  circumstance of  each  case  whether  a
question  of  law is a substantial one and involved  in	 the
case, or not;  the paramount overall consideration being the
need   for   striking  a   judicious  balance  between	 the
indispensable  obligation  to do justice at all	 stages	 and
impelling  necessity of avoiding prolongation in the life of
any lis.
</p>
<p id="p_27">    A  perusal of the judgment of the trial Court shows that
it  has	 extensively  dealt with the  oral  and	 documentary@@
	 JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
evidence  adduced by the parties for deciding the issues  on@@
JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
which  the  parties  went to trial.  It also found  that  in
support	 of  his plea of adverse possession on the  disputed
land, the defendant did not produce any documentary evidence
while  the  oral  evidence  adduced  by	 the  defendant	 was
conflicting  in nature and hence unworthy of reliance.	 The
first  appellate  Court	 has,  in  a  very  cryptic  manner,
reversed   the	finding	 on   question	of  possession	 and
dispossession  as  alleged by the plaintiff as also  on	 the
question  of adverse possession as pleaded by the defendant.
The  appellate	Court has jurisdiction to reverse or  affirm
the findings of the trial Court.  First appeal is a valuable
right of the parties and unless restricted by law, the whole
case is therein open for rehearing both on questions of fact
and  law.   The	 judgment  of	the  appellate	Court  must,
therefore,  reflect  its conscious application of mind,	 and
record	findings  supported  by reasons, on all	 the  issues
arising along with the contentions put forth, and pressed by
the  parties for decision of the appellate Court.  The	task
of  an	appellate Court affirming the findings of the  trial
Court  is an easier one.  The appellate Court agreeing	with
the  view of the trial Court need not restate the effect  of
the  evidence  or reiterate the reasons given by  the  trial
Court;	 expression of general agreement with reasons  given
by  the	 Court,	 decision of which is  under  appeal,  would
ordinarily  suffice  (See  Girijanandini Devi  &amp;  Ors.	 Vs.
Bijendra  Narain  Choudhary, AIR 1967 SC 1124).	  We  would,
however,  like	to sound a note of caution.   Expression  of
general agreement with the findings recorded in the judgment
under appeal should not be a device or camouflage adopted by
the appellate Court for shirking the duty cast on it.  While
writing	 a  judgment  of reversal the appellate	 Court	must
remain	conscious of two principles.  Firstly, the  findings
of  fact  based	 on conflicting evidence arrived at  by	 the
trial  Court  must weigh with the appellate Court,  more  so
when the findings are based on oral evidence recorded by the
same  presiding	 Judge	who   authors  the  judgment.	This
certainly  does not mean that when an appeal lies on  facts,
the appellate Court is not competent to reverse a finding of
fact  arrived at by the trial Judge.  As a matter of law  if
the  appraisal	of the evidence by the trial  Court  suffers
from  a	 material irregularity or is based  on	inadmissible
evidence or on conjectures and surmises, the appellate Court
is  entitled  to  interfere with the finding  of  fact	(See
Madhusudan  Das Vs.  Smt.  Narayani Bai &amp; Ors., AIR 1983  SC
</p><p id="p_28">114).	The rule is __ and it is nothing more than a rule of
practice  __ that when there is conflict of oral evidence of
the  parties on any matter in issue and the decision  hinges
upon the credibility of witnesses, then unless there is some
special	 feature about the evidence of a particular  witness
which  has  escaped the trial Judges notice or there  is  a
sufficient  balance of improbability to displace his opinion
as to where the credibility lies, the appellate Court should
not  interfere	with  the finding of the trial	Judge  on  a
question   of  fact.(See  Sarju	  Pershad  Ramdeo  Sahu	 Vs.
Jwaleshwari  Pratap  Narain Singh &amp; Ors., AIR 1951 SC  120).
Secondly,  while  reversing a finding of fact the  appellate
Court  must  come  into close quarters	with  the  reasoning
assigned  by the trial Court and then assign its own reasons
for arriving at a different finding.  This would satisfy the
Court  hearing	a  further appeal that the  first  appellate
Court  had discharged the duty expected of it.	We need only
remind	 the  first  appellate	 Courts	 of  the  additional
obligation cast on them by the scheme of the present <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_14">Section
100</a>  substituted  in<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_15">  the Code</a>.	 The first  appellate  Court
continues,  as	before, to be a final Court of facts;	pure
findings  of  fact remain immune from challenge	 before	 the
High  Court in second appeal.  Now the first appellate Court
is  also a final Court of law in the sense that its decision
on a question of law even if erroneous may not be vulnerable
before	the  High  Court  in   second  appeal  because	 the
jurisdiction  of  the  High  Court  has	 now  ceased  to  be
available  to  correct	the errors of law or  the  erroneous
findings  of the first appellate Court even on questions  of
law unless such question of law be a substantial one.
</p>
<p id="p_29">    Reverting  back to the facts of the case at hand,  prima
facie  we  find the first appellate Court did not  discharge
the  duty  cast on it as a Court of first appeal.  The	High
Court having noticed failure on the part of the appellant in
not  discharging  the  statutory obligation cast on  him  by
sub-section  (3)  of <a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_16">Section 100</a> of the Code, on account  of
the  substantial  question  of law involved  in	 the  appeal
having	not  been  stated,  much   less	 precisely,  in	 the
memorandum  of	second appeal, ordinarily an opportunity  to
frame  such  question  should  have  been  afforded  to	 the
appellant unless the deficiency was brought to the notice of
the  appellant previously by the High Court Registry or	 the
court  and  yet the appellant had persisted in his  default.
That   was  not	 done.	 In   our  opinion,  the   following
substantial  question  of law does arise as involved in	 the
case and worth being heard by the High Court:-
</p>
<p id="p_30">    Whether  on	 the pleadings and the material	 brought  on
record by the defendant, the first appellate Court was right
in  holding that the case of adverse possession was made out
by  the	 defendant and the suit filed by the  plaintiff	 was
liable to be dismissed as barred by time under <a href="/doc/948485/" id="a_17">Article 65</a> of
the  <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_18">Limitation	 Act</a>,  1963, more so when such	finding	 was
arrived at in reversal of the findings of the trial Court?
</p>
<p id="p_31">    The appeal is allowed.  The case is remitted back to the
High  Court  for  hearing  and deciding	 the  second  appeal
afresh.	  We  make it clear that we have not  expressed	 any
opinion either way on any of the issues arising for decision
in  the	 case.	We also make it clear that our	framing	 the
question  of law involved in the appeal shall not take	away
the  jurisdiction  of  the High Court vesting  in  it  under
provisio  to sub-section(5) of Section 100 of the C.P.C.  to
formulate any other question of law involved in the case The
second	 appeal	 shall	be  decided   by  the	High   Court
uninfluenced  by  any of the observations  made	 hereinabove
which  have been made solely to support our opinion that the
appeal did not merit a summary dismissal by the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_32">    The	 appeal	 stands	 disposed  of in  the  terms  stated
hereinabove.  No order as to the costs.@@
