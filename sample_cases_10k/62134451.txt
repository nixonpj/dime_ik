               person.

                                               JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       Vide this judgment, I propose to dispose of the above titled criminal complaint u/s 138 of
<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_2">Negotiable Instruments Act</a>. The brief facts of the case are as follows: -
</p><p id="p_2">1.     That the accused being close relative of the complainant, took friendly loan of Rs.6 lacs
       from the complainant with promise that the accused will return the same on or before
       month of April, 2006. The accused issued three cheques for Rs.2,00,000/- each in favour
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">02406R0744832006                               -1-</span>
                              Kamlesh Kumari v. Satya Bhan Sharma

     of the complainant with promise that the same will be honoured. Out of the three cheques,
     cheque bearing no.024270 for Rs.2,00,000/- dated 6.4.2006 is drawn on Punjab National
     Bank, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi from account no.17183 and cheque no.024271 for Rs.
     2,00,000/- dated 26.4.2006 is drawn on Punjab National Bank, Branch at New Delhi from
     account no.024271. Both the said cheques bearing no.024270 and 024271 are Ex.CW1/A
     (colly).
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.   That the complainant presented both the said cheques in her bank i.e. Bank of Baroda,
     Nehru Nagar, New Delhi for encashment. However, cheque no.024270 dated 6.4.2006 for
     Rs.2,00,000/- was dishonoured by banker of the accused with return memo dated
     17.7.2006 for the reason "Funds Insufficient" and similarly, the cheque no.024271 dated
     26.4.2006 for Rs.2,00,000/- was also dishonoured by the banker of the accused with return
     memo dated 19.7.2006 for the reason "Funds Insufficient". The cheque return memo dated
     17.7.2006 is Ex.CW1/B and the cheque return memo dated 19.7.2006 is Ex.CW1/C.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.   That on 19.7.2006, when the intimation regarding dishonour of cheque no.024271 was
     received by the complainant, she contacted the accused for payment of the cheque amount
     but it seemed that the accused was deliberately and intentionally avoiding the payment of
     the amount of the cheque. The complainant through his counsel also served a legal
     demand notice dated 26.7.2006 upon the accused by registered post as well as UPC. The
     copy of legal notice is Ex.CW1/D, postal receipt is Ex.CW1/E and UPC receipt is
     Ex.CW1/F. The legal notice send by the complainant through UPC was deemed by the
     complainant to have been received upon the accused as the complainant's counsel has not
     received the A.D. card. The complainant and accused have also been in contact
     telephonically and thus, the accused has full knowledge regarding the legal demand
     notice, but the accused has failed to make payment of the amount of cheques in question
     to the complainant within the period stipulated in the legal demand notice. Therefore, the
     complainant has filed the present complaint against the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.   Accordingly, the summoning order was passed against the accused on 28.08.2006 and on

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">02406R0744832006                           -2-</span>
                              Kamlesh Kumari v. Satya Bhan Sharma

     appearance of the accused, the notice under <a href="/doc/429078/" id="a_3">section 251</a> Cr.P.C. was served upon the
     accused on 27.5.2008, to which the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.   Thereafter, the complainant filed her evidence by way of affidavit, which is dated
     16.12.2008. The accused, however, failed to cross-examine the complainant on the said
     affidavit. Even though, the said affidavit was not duly tendered before the court, the same
     being in original and duly attested by a seal of Oath Commissioner is being read as part of
     evidence of the complainant alongwith pre-summoning evidence by way of affidavit filed
     by the complainant, in view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/138755618/" id="a_4">section 145</a> of N.I. Act. After the accused
     failed to cross-examine the complainant despite several opportunities, the matter
     proceeded for recording statement of accused u/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a>. The statement of accused u/s
     313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a>. was recorded and all the incriminating evidence were put to the accused. In
     the said statement, the accused stated that he has never taken any loan from the
     complainant. He also mentioned that he never issued any cheque to the complainant. The
     accused also stated that the complainant is related to him as being his sister-in-law and
     that he had kept certain blank signed cheques at his home, which have been
     misappropriated by the complainant. The accused also stated that the handwriting on the
     cheques in question are not his own, except for the signatures. He further mentioned that
     he never received the legal demand notice, which has been filed by the complainant on
     record. The accused also mentioned that he is an innocent person and has been falsely
     implicated in the present complaint. The accused thereafter examined two defence
     witnesses i.e. DW-1 Vinay Sharma and DW-2 Manju Sharma.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.   DW-1 Vinay Sharma stated in his examination-in-chief that he is the brother of the
     complainant and brother-in-law of the accused. He also stated that he has cordial
     relationship with both the parties and he frequently visits their residences. He mentioned
     in his deposition that the complainant has never spoken to him about any loan given by
     her to the accused. He further stated that he became aware about the present dispute
     between the complainant and the accused only last year i.e. on or about year 2010. He also

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">02406R0744832006                           -3-</span>
                               Kamlesh Kumari v. Satya Bhan Sharma

     mentioned in his statement that there has been no meeting in his presence between the
     complainant and the accused regarding any settlement of dispute and that there might have
     been some talks regarding any dispute between the parties with the father of the said
     witness. He also mentioned that according to his knowledge, the accused has never taken
     any loan from him or from any other person. DW-1 was, then, cross-examined by counsel
     for the complainant, wherein he stated that he is maternal brother of the complainant and
     the accused is his real brother-in-law. He also mentioned that he has not visited the
     residence of the complainant for last about 3/4 years and has not visited the residence of
     the accused for last about 1 or 2 years. Thereafter, the said witness denied all other
     suggestions put to him by counsel for the complainant, wherein, the knowledge of present
     loan in question was suggested by Ld. Counsel for the complainant. The witness also
     categorically denied the suggestions testing the veracity of his statement.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.   DW-2 Manju Sharma mentioned in her examination-in-chief that the accused is her
     brother-in-law (JEEJA) and that she also frequently visits the residence of the accused i.e.
     almost on every Sundays. She further stated that in March, 2006, she visited the accused
     on a Sunday and it was found that in one of the rooms, there were three cheques lying on
     the table, which had signatures of the accused and the amount mentioned on them. The
     name of the payee and the date were, however, not mentioned on the said cheques as per
     the statement made by the said witness. She further stated that she made an inquiry from
     the accused regarding the said cheques. The accused informed her that he has kept the said
     cheques for the purchase of certain property in Meerut and that he is waiting for the
     person, to whom the said cheques are to be handed over. The witness further deposed that
     the complainant, who is her cousin and daughter of her BUA, also came to the residence
     of the accused on the same day and they had tea and snacks at the house of the accused on
     the said date. The witness also stated that after the complainant left from the house of the
     accused on the said date, the accused informed her that the cheques are missing from the
     table where they were left. The witness further deposed before the court that the accused
     thereafter called up the complainant to inquire about the cheques, but the complainant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">02406R0744832006                            -4-</span>
                               Kamlesh Kumari v. Satya Bhan Sharma

     refused any knowledge about the said cheques, and that the cheques were never found
     thereafter, even though, DW-2 kept on inquiring from the accused regarding the said
     cheques. She further stated that the two cheques filed in the present complaint are out of
     the said three cheques, which were lost from the residence of the accused on that
     particular day and that she can also recognize the signatures of the accused and the
     amount mentioned on the said cheques, which is in the handwriting of the accused. DW-2
     was, then, cross-examined by Ld. Counsel for the complainant. In her cross-examination,
     she stated that she came to know about the present complaint in the month of March, 2006
     and somewhere around Holi festival, however, she cannot recall the exact date. She also
     mentioned that she is unaware whether any reply to the legal demand notice or to the court
     summons is given by the accused in the present complaint. She further stated that no
     complaint regarding the loss of cheques has been lodged by the accused or by herself
     since the complainant is also one of their relatives. In the remaining part of her cross-
     examination, she admitted ignorance regarding knowledge of any complaint being filed by
     the accused for the lost cheques, or whether under any law, any complaint regarding the
     loss of cheques is to be lodged by any party. She also seemed unaware as to whether the
     complainant had visited her father referring about the present dishonoured cheques. All
     other suggestions testing the veracity of the said witness were also denied by DW-2.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.   I have perused the entire record and heard the submissions of both the parties. Ld. Counsel
     for the accused has moved an application u/s 73 read with <a href="/doc/1025384/" id="a_7">section 45</a> of Indian Evidence
     Act, praying that the correctness and genuineness of the handwriting of the accused on the
     body of the cheques be ascertained by the court in view of the said provisions. I have
     perused the said application. The opinion on the said application shall be expressed in the
     course of the present judgment. Ld. Counsel for the accused also filed written submissions
     which are on record in CC No.913/10, which is one of the connected complaints between
     the parties pertaining to the same cause of action.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.   At the outset, it is pertinent to mention the law in respect of <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_8">section 138</a> of N.I. Act. In

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">02406R0744832006                             -5-</span>
                                 Kamlesh Kumari v. Satya Bhan Sharma

      order to determine the question whether offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_9">Section 138</a> of the Act
      is made out against the accused, it is necessary to prove all the following ingredients:
</p>
<p id="p_11">         i. There is legally enforceable liability / debt.
</p><p id="p_12">         ii. The drawer of the cheques issued the cheques to satisfy part or whole of the debt or
             other liability.
</p><p id="p_13">         iii. The cheques so issued have been returned due to insufficiency of funds or exceeds
              arrangement.
</p><p id="p_14">         iv. Payment not made by the accused despite service of the legal demand notice.
</p>
<p id="p_15">10.   Moreover, the <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_10">Negotiable Instruments Act</a> also raises certain presumptions in favour of the
      holder in due course of a negotiable instrument. As per <a href="/doc/517539/" id="a_11">section 118</a> (a) of the said Act,
      "Until the contrary is proved, the following presumptions shall be made:-
</p><p id="p_16">      (a) of consideration - that every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for
      consideration, and that every such instrument, when it has been accepted, endorsed,
      negotiated or transferred, was accepted, endorsed, negotiated or transferred for
      consideration;"
</p>
<p id="p_17">11.   <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_12">Section 139</a> of the Act stipulates and as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         "It shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the holder of a cheque
         received the cheque of the nature referred to in <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_13">section 138</a> for the discharge, in whole
         or in part, or any debt or other liability."

<p id="p_18">12.   Under the light of these provisions and the provisions of the Law of Evidence, I have
      examined the evidence placed on record on behalf of both the parties. Perusal of the
      record shows that the cheques in question have been dishonoured for the reason "Funds
      Insufficient". In view of <a href="/doc/177946336/" id="a_14">section 147</a> of Negotiable Instruments Act, the bank slip denoting
      the reason for dishonour of the cheque is the prima-facie evidence, which leads to a
      presumption of the fact of dishonor of such cheque, until and unless, the said fact is
      disproved in the course of the trial. Accused neither led any evidence to show that the
      cheques in question were dishonoured for any other reason nor he rebutted the
      genuineness and admissibility of the bank returning memos. The main defence of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">02406R0744832006                               -6-</span>
                                 Kamlesh Kumari v. Satya Bhan Sharma

      accused was that he had kept the cheques at his home which were allegedly stolen by the
      complainant and misappropriated by her and therefore, there does not arise any liability
      against the accused. The accused tried to support the said defence by arguing that the
      complainant is also one of his relatives and a frequent visitor to his residence. The accused
      also supported the said defence by examining two witnesses in his defence. However,
      perusal of the entire deposition of DW-1 shows that he is unaware about any transaction
      between the complainant and the accused. He even mentioned in his cross-examination
      that he has not visited the residence of the complainant for last 3/4 years and the residence
      of the accused for last about 1-2 years. The said witness appears to be completely
      oblivious to any money transaction between the complainant and the accused including
      the transaction in question. Therefore, the deposition of the said witness does not appear to
      be a relevant piece of evidence. Since no transaction has taken place in the presence of the
      said witness, therefore, the deposition of the said witness also does not come to any
      support of the defence.
</p>
<p id="p_19">13.   The only other witness examined by the accused was DW-2 Manju Sharma, to whom, the
      accused is related as being her brother-in-law (Jeeja). In her statement, the said witness
      has stated that in the month of March, 2006, when she had visited the accused at his
      residence, she found certain cheques lying on the table and when she inquired from the
      accused regarding the said cheques, the accused informed her that the said cheques are for
      purchase of certain property in Meerut. The said witness also mentioned that even the
      complainant had visited the residence of the accused on the same day and that she had met
      the complainant and they even had tea and snacks at the residence of the accused on the
      particular day. In her statement, the witness has also averred that after the complainant had
      left from the residence of the accused, the accused informed her that the cheques have
      been missing from the table, where they were kept lying. She also mentioned that the
      accused called up the complainant to inquire about the cheques, however, the complainant
      has refused any knowledge about the said cheques. From the said statement of the DW-2,
      it is clear that the accused came to know about the fact that the cheques have been missing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">02406R0744832006                              -7-</span>
                               Kamlesh Kumari v. Satya Bhan Sharma

      from his residence on the same day itself. However, nothing has been brought on record
      by the accused to show that he had lodged any complaint in any police station or before
      any court regarding the loss of cheques or that the cheques have been stolen by the
      complainant. It is also clear from the entire material on record that no instructions were
      also given by the accused to his banker for stopping payment of the said cheques despite
      the fact that he had become aware that the cheques have been lost/stolen. The cheques
      have been dishonoured for the reason "Funds Insufficient", which as observed earlier, is a
      prima-facie evidence of the fact of dishonor of the cheques in question.
</p>
<p id="p_20">14.   The only other argument led by the accused in his defence is that the cheques in question
      do not bear his handwriting except for the signatures. Ld. Counsel for the accused has
      accordingly moved an application under <a href="/doc/770022/" id="a_15">section 73</a> of Indian Evidence Act (incorrectly
      mentioned as <a href="/doc/718585/" id="a_16">section 73</a> of Cr.P.C. on the application of the accused) read with <a href="/doc/1025384/" id="a_17">section 45</a>
      of Indian Evidence Act. I have perused the said application and have also read the
      provisions of <a href="/doc/1194598/" id="a_18">section 73</a> as well as 45 of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_19">Indian Evidence Act</a>. I would like to

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                       Such persons are called experts.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">15.   It is clear from bare reading of the said provisions that not just the court has been
      empowered to make comparison of disputed and admitted signatures of a party, but the
      court can also take the opinion of expert in comparing and analyzing the handwriting on
      any document. <a href="/doc/1458526/" id="a_23">Section 46</a> and <a href="/doc/1463645/" id="a_24">47</a> of Indian Evidence Act are also relevant, which give
      due importance to the opinion expressed about any handwriting by any expert or any other
      person, who is acquainted with the handwriting of the alleged person for the purpose of
      <a href="/doc/770022/" id="a_25">section 73</a> of the Indian Evidence Act. <a href="/doc/770022/" id="a_26">Section 73</a> of the Indian Evidence Act also enables
      the court to take specimen handwriting of the person, who prays that his handwriting be
      compared with the disputed handwriting on an alleged document. In the present
      application, the prayer of the accused was only that the court should compare the
      handwriting of the accused on the cheque in question with the specimen handwriting
      which the accused was willing to give before the court. No prayer as to the effect that the
      alleged document be sent for an expert opinion was made in the said application. As per
      the settled position of law, under the provision of <a href="/doc/770022/" id="a_27">section 73</a> of Indian Evidence Act, as a
      rule of prudence the expert opinion may be sought for analyzing any handwriting or any
      signature of a party. In the present case, it appears that no purpose would have been served
      by sending the cheques in question for expert analysis as signatures on the cheques in
      question are already admitted by the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_22">16.   Further, <a href="/doc/232831/" id="a_28">section 20</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act, is a relevant provision which talks
      about 'Inchoate Instruments". The said provision reads as under: -

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">02406R0744832006                             -9-</span>
                                Kamlesh Kumari v. Satya Bhan Sharma

                another a paper stamped in accordance with the law relating to negotiable
                instruments then in force in India, and either wholly blank or having written
                thereon an incomplete negotiable instrument, he thereby gives prima facie
                authority to the holder thereof to make or complete, as the case may be, upon it
                a negotiable instrument, for any amount specified therein and not exceeding the
                amount covered by the stamp. The person so signing shall be liable upon such
                instrument, in the capacity in which he signed the same, to any holder in due
                course for such amount: provided that no person other than a holder in due
                course shall cover from the person delivering the instrument anything in excess
                of the amount intended by him to be paid thereunder.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_23">      It is clear from the said provision that when a person signs and delivers to any person a
      document which is either wholly blank or having written thereon an implied negotiable
      instrument, he thereby gives prima-facie authority to the holder to make or complete the
      same. The said provision makes the person, who has signed the said instrument liable for
      the said instrument in his capacity in which he signs the same, to any holder in due course
      for the said amount as mentioned on the instrument. The provision also comes with a
      proviso which states that no person other than a holder in due course shall recover from
      the person delivering the instrument anything in excess of the amount intended by him to
      be paid thereunder. In view of the said provision, it is clear that if the accused had kept a
      blank signed cheque at home, which was misplaced, he had in fact given authority to the
      person who finds the said cheque to fill details on the same and present it for encashment.
      The accused, thus, becomes liable to the holder in due course for the amount mentioned
      on the cheques in question. The accused has also not adduced any evidence to show that
      the complainant is not the holder in due course of the said cheques. Therefore, the fact that
      the details on the cheques in question are not in the handwriting of the accused does not
      hold a good defence in favour of the accused in view of <a href="/doc/232831/" id="a_30">section 20</a> of the Negotiable
      Instruments Act.
</p>
<p id="p_24">17.   From the entire material on record, the accused could not bring any evidence to show that
      the cheques in question were not issued in discharge of any legally enforceable debt or

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">02406R0744832006                             -10-</span>
                               Kamlesh Kumari v. Satya Bhan Sharma

      liability. The only defence taken was that the complainant being a relative of the accused
      was within her capacity to misuse the cheques, which may have been found lying at the
      house of the accused, does not appear to be a satisfactory defence to rebut the strong
      presumption of law lying in favour of the complainant. Moreover, as observed earlier, the
      fact that no complaint was lodged by the accused against the complainant or any other
      person regarding the loss of the cheques despite the fact that it came to his knowledge that
      the cheques have been misplaced on the very same day on which he had kept them lying
      on a table at his residence, also weakens the defence of the accused. Thus, the
      presumption that the cheques in question were issued in discharge of a liability stands
      duly proved.
</p>
<p id="p_25">18.   As held in various caselaws, the standard of proof on the part of the accused and that of
      the prosecution is different in a criminal trial. Whereas, prosecution must prove the guilt
      of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt, the standard of proof so as to prove a defence
      on the part of the accused is 'preponderance of probabilities'. Inference of preponderance
      of probabilities can be drawn not only from the materials brought on record by the parties
      but also by reference to the circumstances upon which he/she relies (cited from, <a href="/doc/673245/" id="a_31">Krishna
      Janardhan Bhat v. Dattatraya G. Hegde</a> (2008) 4 SCC 54). Moreover, in the decision of
      <a href="/doc/1891718/" id="a_32">Drum Manufacturing Co. v. Amin Chand Pyarelal</a> (1993) 3 SCC 35, after analysing
      various judgments, the Apex Court observed that the position of law which emerges is that
      once execution of the promissory note is admitted, the presumption under <a href="/doc/371095/" id="a_33">Section 118</a> (a)
      would arise that it is supported by a consideration. Such a presumption is rebuttable. The
      defendant (or the accused) can prove the non-existence of a consideration by raising a
      probable defence. Furthermore, in the recent judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in
      <a href="/doc/150051/" id="a_34">Rangappa v. Sri Mohan</a> (2010) INSC 373 (decision dated 07.05.2010), after analysing
      the law laid down in previous judgments, it was held that the presumption mandated by
      <a href="/doc/334170/" id="a_35">Section 139</a> of the Act does indeed include the existence of a legally enforceable debt or
      liability. This is a rebuttable presumption, even though this initial presumption lies in
      favour of the complainant. If the accused is able to raise a probable defence which creates
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">02406R0744832006                             -11-</span>
                                 Kamlesh Kumari v. Satya Bhan Sharma

      doubt about the existence of a legally enforceable debt or liability, prosecution can fail.
</p>
<p id="p_26">19.   Moreover, the accused also did not lead anything in defence to show that the legal demand
      notice was not served upon him. In view of the presumption of law and also the settled
      position of law that once the notice is dispatched on the correct address of the accused,
      unless and until the contrary is proved by the addressee, service of the notice is deemed to
      have been effected at the time at which the letter would have been delivered in the
      ordinary course of business (in judgment of <a href="/doc/272690/" id="a_36">C.C. Alavi Haji v. Palapetty Muhammed &amp;
      Anr</a>. 2007 Cr.L.J. (SC) 3214: 2007 (7) SCR 326 (emphasis supplied)). Thus, in the
      absence of any contrary evidence, it can be deemed that the notice was served upon the
      accused. Further the provisions of <a href="/doc/147127/" id="a_37">Section 101</a> of the Evidence Act provide that the
      burden of proof of the facts rests on the party who substantially asserts it and not on the
      party who denies it. In fact, burden of proof means that a party has to prove an allegation
      before he is entitled to a judgment in his favour. <a href="/doc/192696/" id="a_38">Section 103</a> provides that burden of proof
      as to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the court to believe in its existence,
      unless it is provided by any special law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular
      person. The provision of <a href="/doc/192696/" id="a_39">Section 103</a> amplifies the general rule of <a href="/doc/147127/" id="a_40">Section 101</a> that the
      burden of proof lies on the person who asserts the affirmative of the facts in issue. In the
      present case as well, the onus was upon the accused to establish that the notice was not
      served upon him, but no cogent evidence was brought by the accused to prove the same.
</p>
<p id="p_27">20.   Thus, in the present case, the accused was not able to sufficiently rebut the presumption
      lying in favour of the complainant. The ambiguities, discrepancies and contradictions in
      the depositions of the accused and the defence witnesses at various places further weaken
      the defence of the accused. The accused and the defence witnesses could also not
      substantiate their averments by way of documentary evidence. In view of the material on
      record, submissions of the Counsel for both sides, the admission by the accused of the
      signatures on the cheque in question as well as the prima facie evidence of the dishonour
      of the cheque in question for the reason "Funds Insufficient" and, above all, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">02406R0744832006                               -12-</span>
                               Kamlesh Kumari v. Satya Bhan Sharma

      presumption of the law lying in favour of the complainant, I am of the considered view
      that the the ingredients for offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_41">section 138</a> of Negotiable Instruments Act stands
      proved and the complainant has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt as against the
      accused. Accused has clearly failed to rebut the presumption of law. Apart from not
      raising a probable defence, accused was also not able to contest the existence of a legally
      enforceable debt or liability. I, therefore, hold accused Satya Bhan Sharma, guilty of the
      offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_42">Section 138</a> of Negotiable Instruments Act. Accused is convicted.

Act</a> vide judgment dated 09.10.2012. I have heard Ld. Counsel for complainant as well as Ld.
Counsel for the accused on the sentencing of the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_30">       Ld. Counsel for the accused submits that the accused is the sole bread earner of the family
and a family to take care of. It is further submitted that the accused has small children to look-
after and is also liable to maintain his wife. It is further submitted that the accused has never been
involved in any litigation in past and has absolutely clean antecedents. Ld. Counsel for the
accused prays that considering family background of the accused, his socio-economic status and
the nature of the offence, and the fact that he was only a victim of the circumstances, a lenient
view may be taken towards the accused and he be released on fine only.

been suffered by the complainant in contesting the present complaint. A lot of expense has been

                                Kamlesh Kumari v. Satya Bhan Sharma

suffered by the complainant in terms of money and time. It is also argued that the trial has
stretched for more than 6 years and the complainant has suffered great hardship in prosecuting
the present complaint. It is further argued that since the cheque amount is also huge and also
since the accused never made any efforts to compound the matter, therefore, it is prayed that
stricter punishment be imposed upon the accused, so as to create a deterrent effect in such
offences.

<p id="p_32">       I have perused the record of this case and after considering the submissions of both the
counsels, I am of the view that keeping in mind the age of the accused, his family background,
his antecedents, the nature of the offence, facts of the present case, the conduct of the accused
during the entire course of the trial and at the same time balancing the interests of both the
parties, I deem it proper to impose a sentence of fine of Rs. 5,50,000/- upon the accused and
a simple imprisonment for a period of three months. The entire fine shall be paid as
compensation to the complainant. In default of payment of fine, the accused shall be liable
to undergo a Simple Imprisonment of one month in addition to the substantive
imprisonment.
