                 IN THE HIGH COURT AT CALCUTTA
                CONSTITUTIONAL WRIT JURISDICTION
                         ORIGINAL SIDE


Present : The Hon'ble Justice Dipankar Datta


                              Smt. Arati Ghose &amp; anr.
                  ...Petitioners
                                     Versus

                               Satya Narayan Tripathi &amp; ors.
                                                    ...Respondents

For the petitioners            :   Mr. Pratap Chateerjee, Sr. Advocate,
                                   Mr. Malay Kumar Ghosh, Advocate,
                                   Mr. Nilay Sengupta, Advocate,
                                   Mr. Indranil Kanta, Advocate.

For the respondent 1           :   Mr. Ashis Kumar Bagchi, Advocate,
                                   Mr. Prabir Misra, Advocate,
                                   Mr. Amitava Roy, Advocate,
                                   Mr. Supriyo Roy, Advocate.

For the respondent 6 (State)   :   Mr. B.C. Ray, Advocate General,
                                   Mr. A.K. Chatterjee, Advocate,
                                   Mr. Suman Ghosh, Advocate.


Hearing concluded on : 16.2.2010

Judgment on : 22.2.2010

      The petitioners initiated proceedings under Section 6 of the West Bengal

Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 (hereafter the WBPT Act) before the learned Judge,

5th Bench, Court of Small Causes at Calcutta on December 8, 2004 for recovery

of possession of the premises in question from the respondent no.1, being the

defendant therein. The petitioners' claim was allowed and order for recovery of

possession was passed on May 15, 2006. Proceedings travelled upto the Supreme
                                            2


Court. The order for recovery of possession survived with certain modifications

whereafter it was put into execution. By order dated March 17, 2009, the learned

Judge dismissed the execution case relying on the decision of a learned Single

Judge of this Court in Tapas Biswas vs. Shyama Prosad Ghoshal : 2009 (1) CHN

183. The learned Judge held as follows :

             "Since the Hon'ble High Court held that Presidency Small Causes
      Court has no jurisdiction and the decree passed by the Presidency Small
      Causes Court, Calcutta after the amendment of 2005 is nullity, this court has
      no jurisdiction to proceed with the instant execution case any further
      because the court cannot execute a decree which is a nullity.
             As this court has no jurisdiction to try the eviction suit under West
      Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997, this Court has also no jurisdiction to
      execute the decree passed under the said Act due to inherent lack of
      jurisdiction.
                                  Hence, it is Ordered
      That the instant petition filed by the Jdr is hereby allowed on contest but
      without cost.
      The instant execution case shall not proceed any further.
      The decree holder/plaintiff is at liberty to make proper application in the
      original suit for return of the plaint.
                                                     Judge 5th Bench"


      This order is the subject matter of challenge in this writ petition dated April

1, 2009 wherein the petitioners have prayed for the following relief :

      "a) A declaration that Presidency Small Causes Court at Calcutta has and
      had, a jurisdiction to hear the Ejectment Suit No.281 of 2004(E) and all
      proceeding arising there from;
      b) A declaration be given for hearing of Ejectment Execution Case No.193 of
      2006 arising out of Ejectment Suit No.281 of 2004 (E) on merit;
      c) A writ of and/or in the nature of certiorari, do issue calling upon the
      Respondent No.5 to forthwith transmit to this Hon'ble Court all records
      relating to Ejectment Suit no.281 of 2004 (E) and Ejectment Execution Case
      No.193 of 2006 so that conscionable justice may be dune by quashing
      and/or set aside the order No.48 dated 17.3.2009, passed by the Learned
      Judge, 5th Bench, Presidency Small Causes Court at Calcutta in Ejectment
      Execution Case No.193 of 2006, arising out of Ejectment Suit No.281 of 2004
      (E)."
                                             3


      It appears that the writ petition was considered on a number of days

between May 4, 2009 and October 23, 2009 by a learned Judge of this Court. In

view of the importance of the issue involved herein, Mr. Balai Chandra Ray, the

learned Advocate General for the State was requested to assist the Court.

      The writ petition has since been listed before me for final hearing. The rival

parties and Mr. Ray have been heard.

      Mr. Bagchi, learned Advocate for the respondent no.1/judgment debtor

contended that this Court ought not to pass any orders on the writ petition, as

prayed for, since the jurisdiction of the Court of Writ (Single Bench) is excluded

by the provisions contained in the West Bengal Land Reforms and Tenancy

Tribunal Act, 1997 (hereafter the LRTT Act). He referred to the provisions

contained in Sections 2(r)(vi), 6, 7, 8 and 11 of the LRTT Act in support of his

submission.

      On merits, he contended that the learned Judge who allowed the

application of the petitioners not having been appointed as Controller in terms of

Section 38 of the WBPT Act, he had usurped jurisdiction to decide the lis and the

order passed by him is a nullity.

      Mr. Ray supported the argument of Mr. Bagchi.

      Countering   the   objection,   Mr.       Chatterjee,   learned   Senior   Advocate

representing the petitioners contended that the objection raised by his adversary

is not well-founded. He referred to the Division Bench decision of this Court in

<a href="/doc/1383675/" id="a_1">Pashupati Adhikary vs. Pradyut Kumar @ Tarapada Adhikary</a> : 2003 (4) CHN 347

as well as the provisions of the WBPT Act, as it originally stood and as it stands
                                         4


now after various amendments including the latest amendment thereof brought

about by the West Bengal Premises Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 2009 (hereafter

the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_2">Amendment Act</a>) with effect from June 9, 2009 in support of his submission

that the order passed by the learned Judge allowing the application of the

petitioners praying for eviction of the respondent no.1 and for recovery of

possession ought not to be considered a nullity.

      In his usual fairness, he invited my attention to two Division Bench

decisions of this Court [<a href="/doc/1648448/" id="a_3">Dipak Kumar Singh vs. State of West Bengal</a> : 2008(2)

CHN 943, and Gopika Projects Private Limited vs State of West Bengal &amp; ors. :

2009 (4) CHN 652] wherein, however, the views taken are contrary to the

contentions urged by him. Relying upon the decision of the Supreme Court in

<a href="/doc/1443146/" id="a_4">State of West Bengal vs Ashis Kumar Roy</a> : (2005) 10 SCC 110, the Division

Bench in Dipak Singh (supra), it was submitted, held that the law laid down in

Pashupati Adhikary (supra) is no longer good law. The view taken in Dipak Singh

(supra), he further submitted, has been followed in Gopika Projects (supra)

whereby the decision in Tapas Biswas (supra) has been overruled.

      According to him, however, none of these two decisions stand in the way of

granting relief to the petitioners on the basis of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_5">Amendment Act</a> which,

though had come into effect from June 9, 2009, was not brought to the notice of

the Division Bench while it decided Gopika Projects (supra).

      The contentions raised on behalf of the parties have duly exercised my

consideration.
                                          5


      It is noticed that in terms of Section 6 of the WBPT Act, as originally

enacted, proceedings for an order for recovery of possession of any premises was

required to be initiated by the landlord by an application in the prescribed

manner and considered by the Controller, as defined in <a href="/doc/1523203/" id="a_6">Section 2(a)</a> and

appointed in the manner prescribed by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_7">Section 38</a> thereof. By Section 2(i) of the

West Bengal Premises Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 2005, the words "by the

Controller" in <a href="/doc/582772/" id="a_8">Section 6(1)</a> have been replaced with the words "by the Civil Judge

having jurisdiction" with retrospective effect from March 19, 2005. Also, by

Section 3(1) of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 2006, the

words "except on a suit being instituted by such landlord" have replaced the words

"except on an application made to him by the landlord in the prescribed manner"

with effect from June 1, 2006.

      In my reading of the Division Bench decision dated November 19, 2009 of

this Court in Gopika Projects (supra), an order or decree passed by a Civil Court

in connection with and/or on proceedings initiated by a landlord under the

WBPT Act for recovery of possession of premises in occupation of his tenant

would be open to challenge before the Tribunal constituted under the LRTT Act

and that the revisional/appellate jurisdiction of the Civil Courts superior to the

Court that passed the order/decree would stand excluded.

      Relevant paragraphs from the decision in Gopika Projects (supra), to this

effect, read as follows:

      "87. Similarly, the West Bengal Land Reforms and Tenancy Tribunal Act,
      1997 as we have found from its Preamble, was brought in the statute book
      by the Legislature in its wisdom, for the purpose of adjudication and trial
      regarding disputes, claims, objections and applications relating to or arising
                                            6


      out of land reforms or tenancy in land etc. etc. and for the exclusion of the
      jurisdiction of all Courts. We would be of the view that no more would the
      Civil Court be treated as a sanctum sanctorum in this respect and the
      jurisdiction of the Tribunal can be spurned.
      ******
</pre><p id="p_1">      90. One has to proceed a little further to the salutary provisions of section 7,
      8 and 10 of the West Bengal Land Reforms and Tenancy Tribunal Act, 1997
      which speak of the powers and exclusion of jurisdiction of other Courts.
</p><p id="p_2">      91. Immediately we will find that no other interpretation can be effected so
      as to exclude the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_3">      92. At once it will be clear that there has been exclusion of jurisdiction in
      respect of Orders passed by the Civil Court in such type of Matters and the
      only recourse would be before the Tribunal."
</p>
<p id="p_4">      However, as correctly submitted by Mr. Chatterjee, it does not appear that

the latest amendment introduced by the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_9">Amendment Act</a> was brought to the

notice of the Division Bench. I consider it appropriate to reproduce below the

             The Bill seeks to amend the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997
      (West Ben. Act XXXVII of 1997), with a view to empowering the Court of
      Small Causes constituted under the <a href="/doc/997218/" id="a_17">Presidency Small Causes Courts Act</a>,
      1882 and the City Civil Court established under the City Civil Courts Act,
      1953, to have jurisdiction to try and dispose of the eviction cases since the
      said Act has not empowered the said Courts to have jurisdiction to try and
      dispose of the eviction cases, although many such cases have already been
      filed and disposed of by the said Courts.

      In view of <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_18">Sections 2</a>, <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_19">3</a> and <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_20">4</a> of the Amendment Act, the deficiencies in the

WBPT Act have been sought to be cured. I have little doubt in my mind that the

<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_21">Amendment Act</a> was introduced to overcome the consequences that would ensue

consequent upon the decision of this Court in Tapas Biswas (supra) which,

however, stands overruled by the decision in Gopika Projects (supra).</blockquote><p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">      It is worthy of being noted that while the WBPT Act obtained the assent of

the President of India, the Governor of the State of West Bengal assented to

introduction of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_22">Amendment Act</a>. <a href="/doc/1666903/" id="a_23">In Mohammed Abdul Khader vs. Govt. of

Andhra Pradesh</a> : AIR 1985 Andhra Pradesh 217, a Division Bench of the Andhra

Pradesh High Court held that although the parent Act may have received the

assent of the President but it does not mean that every Bill seeking amendment

of the parent Act should be reserved by the Governor for consideration and

assent of the President. The learned Judges distinguished the Special Bench

decision of this Court (cor. Hon'ble S.P. Mitra, C.J., Hon'ble Sabyasachi Mukharji

and Hon'ble Salil Kumar Datta, JJ.) in <a href="/doc/1701013/" id="a_24">Ananda Kumar Chakraborty vs. State of

West Bengal</a>, AIR 1977 Calcutta 73. Hon'ble Sabyasachi Mukharji, J. (as His

Lordship then was) speaking for the Bench, having regard to the fact that the

amending Act sought to enlarge the period of time within which the empowered

officer can suo motu take steps for revision of the record of rights, thereby

fundamentally affecting the procedure for rectification of record of rights which is

inextricably connected with the scheme of acquisition, and the provisions

contained in <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_25">Article 31A</a> of the Constitution, ruled that without the assent of the

President the same is unenforceable in law. In the process, Their Lordships of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                           9</span>


Special Bench distinguished the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/18546/" id="a_26">S. Ahmed vs.

State of Mysore</a> : AIR 1975 SC 1443. There, the writ petitions filed under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_27">Article

32</a> of the Constitution were dismissed holding that the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_28">Amending Act</a>, though did

not receive Presidential sanction as required under <a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_29">Article 304(b)</a> thereof, only

varied the form of restrictiveness without appreciably adding to the content of the

parent Act and that if the substance of statutory rules is converted into statutory

provisions, that did not really amplify or increase the restrictions already there.

</p><p id="p_10">      I had not called upon the parties to address me on the question as to

whether the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_30">Amendment Act</a> is constitutionally valid or not and hence no

argument was advanced in this behalf. Nonetheless, having regard to one of the

tests applied by the Special Bench in Ananda Kumar Chakraborty (supra) in

holding the amending Act unenforceable, I am prima facie of the view that

validity of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_31">Amendment Act</a> is not free from doubt since it seeks to expand the

ambit of the WBPT Act and validates certain acts without receiving Presidential

assent.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      The people of our country are governed by the rule of law. The Preamble of

the Constitution epitomises the promise of the people of the country that they

shall strive to secure justice, - social, economic and political and equality of

status and of opportunity. Law, therefore, should not be uncertain, be it enacted

by the legislature or declared by the judiciary, so as to result in chaos or

confusion. As in the present case, the landlord/decree-holder having succeeded

till the final tier is faced with a situation where non-interference with the order

impugned would compel him to start proceedings for eviction afresh and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                          10</span>


tenant despite having suffered a decree would stand to reap the benefit of such

anomalous legal position. I am sure, that would not at all be just and make a

mockery of the Preambular promise of securing justice and equality to the people

of the country.
</p>
<p id="p_12">        I am conscious of the issues that have arisen for determination by me on

this petition. At the same time, I am of the firm view that more serious questions

in the field of landlord-tenant dispute for recovery of possession under the WBPT

Act have arisen in view of the amendments to such Act made from time to time

and the decision in Gopika Projects (supra). These issues, which are of

substantial importance, require to be addressed first.

</p><p id="p_13">        Justification   for the course of action I intend to adopt, despite

constitutional validity of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_32">Amendment Act</a> not being under challenge, is that

being a Court empowered to exercise Constitutional Writ Jurisdiction I ought not

to shut my eyes to the myriad problems likely to surface as a consequence of the

law being uncertain. I would fail the oath taken by me while assuming office as a

Judge of this Court to uphold the Constitution if I proceed to tread on the safe

path of deciding the lis before me without expressing concern for the uncertain

laws.
</p>
<p id="p_14">        The law declared by this Court in Gopika Projects (supra) and the statutory

law, post amendment, if valid, in my opinion, cannot be reconciled and, if I may

say so, is in apparent conflict. Having regard thereto, it would not be prudent on

my part to consider the controversy raised in this writ petition on merits unless

the conflict is resolved.

</p><p id="p_16">      In view of possible stalemate situation that might follow in respect of

proceedings before Civil Courts, either pending or terminated, as on date, arising

out of landlord-tenant disputes for recovery of possession under the WBPT Act,

the primary issue that is required to be addressed is :
</p>
<p id="p_17">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">      1. The West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 having received the

      assent of the President of India, whether the West Bengal Premises

      Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 2009 assented to by the Governor of West

      Bengal is constitutionally valid and enforceable as law ?</blockquote><p id="p_18">



</p><p id="p_19">      Depending on and/or irrespective of the answer to the preceding issue, to

my mind, the following further questions may be addressed :



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">      a). Whether on the face of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy

      (Amendment) Act, 2009 which went unnoticed in Gopika Projects

      (supra), the decision therein ought to be considered good law ?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">      b). Since Section 6(1) of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997

      refers to "order or decree", whether "order" mentioned in <a href="/doc/582772/" id="a_33">Section 6</a> (a)

      of the West Bengal Land Reforms and Tenancy Tribunal Act, 1997 would

      include a "decree"? If not, which forum would be competent to entertain

      a challenge to such decree?</blockquote><p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">      c). Having regard to settled law that right of appeal must be conferred

      by statute, whether an order or decree passed by a learned Judge of a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                     12</span>


Civil Court in connection with a suit instituted under the West Bengal

Premises   Tenancy    Act,   1997        is   appealable   before   the   Tribunal

constituted in terms of the West Bengal Land Reforms and Tenancy

Tribunal Act, 1997 despite no right for preferring appeal thereagainst

having been conferred by Section 43 of the West Bengal Premises

Tenancy Act, 1997 or by any other provision thereof?
</p>
<p id="p_22">d). Whether the expression "decree" in Section 6(1) of the West Bengal

Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 would have the same meaning as defined in

Section 2(2) of the Civil Procedure Code and further as to whether the

provisions of such Code would regulate a suit for eviction to be tried by a

Civil Judge having jurisdiction right from commencement till termination

thereof in the absence of any such provision in this behalf in the

aforesaid Act ?
</p>
<p id="p_23">e). What would be the effect of a decree for recovery of possession

passed by a learned Civil Judge who was never appointed as Controller

in terms of Section 38 of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act for the

purpose of Chapter III thereof ?
</p>
<p id="p_24">f). Whether any final or interlocutory order passed in a suit for eviction

by a Civil Judge having jurisdiction exercising power in terms of the West

Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997 can be challenged before this Court

(Single Bench) either under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_34">Article 226</a> or <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_35">Article 227</a> of the Constitution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                          13</span>


      having regard to the provisions in Sections 7 and 8 of the West Bengal

      Land Reforms and Tenancy Tribunal Act ?
</p>
<p id="p_25">

      The questions/issues formulated above are a few out of many and

necessarily may not cover the whole ground of controversy. However, in my

humble view, these are some questions of law of substantial importance and,

accordingly, I do hereby, in the interest of justice and keeping in mind the

provisions contained in Rule 53 of the Writ Rules, direct that the cause papers be

placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice at once for considering the desirability

of constituting an appropriate Bench to address the same.
