<p id="p_1">             This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner against

the judgment dated 02.08.2017 passed by the learned Additional Sessions

Judge, Gurdaspur, affirming the judgment of conviction and order of

sentence passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Batala, dated

10.06.2014, whereby, the petitioner was convicted as under:-

</p><pre id="pre_2">Sr. No.    Sections                           Sentence
   1       304-A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a> Rigorous imprisonment for two years and a fine of

                     imprisonment for one month.

             Both the sentences were ordered to run concurrently.

             When the case came up for initial hearing before this Court on

23.10.2017, this Court had issued notice of motion only on the quantum of

sentence as the counsel for the petitioner had stated that he does not press

the revision petition on merits.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             Custody certificate of the petitioner has been filed in Court,

which indicates that apart from the present FIR, in which he has been

convicted and sentenced, there is no other criminal case registered or

pending against him.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             Counsel for the petitioner contends that keeping in view the

fact that the petitioner is the sole bread winner and 37 years of age with a

family of three minor children and wife along with aged parents, the

sentence which has been imposed by the Courts below is on the higher side.

He, therefore, states that because of the sentences imposed upon the

petitioner and he being in custody, the whole family is suffering. He,

therefore, prays for a lenient view to be taken by this Court with regard to

sentences.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             Having considered the submissions made by the counsel for the

petitioner as also the facts and circumstances of the present case, the present

revision petition which has been preferred by the petitioner having been

limited to the extent of quantum of sentence has been considered. In the

totality of the assertions of the counsel for the petitioner and keeping in

view the fact that the petitioner is a young person with a family to support

and also the fact that he has already undergone a total sentence of 6 months

and 8 days, this Court upholds the conviction of the petitioner, but is

inclined to reduce the sentence and thus, the sentence of the petitioner

under <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_3">Sections 304-A</a> and <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_4">279</a> of the Indian Penal Code is reduced to

9 months (actual) from 2 years, with compensation under <a href="/doc/875650/" id="a_5">Section 357</a> of the

Code of Criminal Procedure to the extent of `50,000/- to be paid to the

legal representatives of deceased Sunny Kumar. However, the sentence of

fine shall remain intact. The amount of compensation be deposited by the

petitioner prior to his release in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate,

Gurdaspur, who shall release the same to the legal representatives of

victim/deceased Sunny Kumar after proper identification.
