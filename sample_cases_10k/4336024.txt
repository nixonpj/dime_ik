                      2. Vivek                                               ... Respondents


                             This case is taken up for settlement before the National Lok Adalat. Both
                      the parties are present. Mr.T.S.Arthanareeswaran, learned counsel for claimant is
                      present and Mr.T.Ravichandran, learned counsel for the insurance company is
                      present. After mutual discussion, negotiation, mediation and conciliation between
                      both parties, they arrived at a compromise to settle the matter as follows:-


                                                TERMS OF SETTLEMENT
                             The compensation has been claimed by the appellant for the injuries
                      suffered by her in an accident. The Tribunal has awarded in M.C.O.P.No.352 of
                      2013 for a sum of Rs.5,95,000/- and has also directed the insurance company,
                      after paying the amount to the injured, can claim the amount from the owner of
                      the vehicle.


                              2. Both the parties are present before us. After detailed deliberation and
                      negotiation, the parties have accepted to settle the claim of Rs.4,75,000/-
                      (Rupees Four lakh and seventy five thousand only) with apportioned interest at
                      the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the application till the date
                      of payment and the same is awarded. The insurance company is directed to
                      deposit the said amount within a period of four (4) weeks from the date of
                      receipt of a copy of this order. The direction regarding the right of the recovery
                      of the said amount from the owner of the vehicle would continue.


                             3. The Tribunal is directed to transfer the amount through RTGS/NEFT to
                      the parties concerned on proper identification in accordance with the terms of
                      the award, without insisting on any formal permission petition. The Civil
                      Miscellaneous Appeal is disposed of accordingly at the SR stage. There shall be
                      no order as to costs.
