JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.         This is a petition under <a href="/doc/1032616/" id="a_3">Section 276</a> of the Indian Succession

Act for grant of probate in respect to the Will dated 17.7.1980 executed

by late Smt. Maya Kaur.        Briefly stated, the facts as stated in the

petition are that Smt. Maya Kaur expired on 25.8.1989. During her life

time, she executed a Will dated 17.7.1980 bequeathing property

bearing No.GC-14, G-Block, Hari Nagar, New Delhi, to the petitioner

and respondent no.2 Shri Ajit Pal Singh. Petitioner and respondents

no.3 to 6 are the daughters of the deceased, while respondent no.2 is

the son of the deceased.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">2.         Citation was published in newspaper 'National Herald', but

no one appeared from general public to file any objection. Notices of

petition were given to the respondents. Respondents no.5 and 6 did

not appear despite service of notices. They were proceeded ex parte.

Respondents no.2 to 4 filed joint common objections challenging the

Will. They have stated in their objections that the deceased had the

desire to execute the Will in favour of her only son Shri Ajit Pal Singh.

She talked to the petitioner in this regard, who was residing with her,

but the petitioner with malafide intention brought her in court premises

on 17.7.1980 and got executed documents viz. Agreement to Sell,

GPA, Will and Receipt etc. showing sale of property in her favour for a
 (PC No.226/06)                                 (<a href="/doc/4767/" id="a_4">Harjit Kaur vs. State &amp; Ors</a>.)

consideration of Rs.69,600/-. The petitioner during the life time of the

deceased mother filed a suit on 20.10.1985 for permanent injunction

against her deceased mother and brother Shri Ajit Pal Singh for

restraining them from interfering and dispossessing the petitioner from

property No.GC-14/WZ-146, G-Block, Hari Nagar, New Delhi. In the

Written Statement, the deceased stated that she was an uneducated

lady and was asked to sign certain documents without knowing or

understanding the contents. The contents of documents were neither

read over to her nor she was made to understand the same. She had

stated in the written statement that the Will has been bequeathed by her

in favour of her only son with the right to the petitioner and her son

'Bawa' to live in the house till some alternative arrangement was made

by her when her son would be able to earn. She denied having taken a

sum of Rs.69,600/- as had been alleged by the petitioner. She has

further stated in the written statement that she had been supporting the

petitioner and her son because she was a divorcee and had no place to

live. The said civil suit was dismissed in default on 03.9.1985. It has

been stated that the petitioner is not entitled for probate.



</p><p id="p_4">3.         Petitioner filed rejoinder to the written statement/ objections

reiterating the averments which she had made in her petition. She has

denied    that   the   Will   has   been    procured     mischievously     by

misrepresentation.

<p id="p_8">5.             In order to prove her case, the petitioner produced two

6.         PW2 is Shri Avtar Singh Sohal, Advocate.             He is the

</pre>attesting witness to the Will. He has proved the Will Ex.PW2/1.<p id="p_10">



</p><p id="p_11">7.         In their evidence, respondents examined three witnesses

RW1 Ajit Pal Singh (respondent no.2),         RW2 Smt. Inderjeet Kaur

(respondent no.4) and RW3 Smt. Harjinder Kaur. All three of them

have filed their affidavits Ex.R1 to Ex.R3 respectively. They have filed

similar affidavits stating therein about the averments made in their

objections, the same are not being reproduced for the sake of brevity.



</p><p id="p_12">8.         Both sides preferred to file written arguments. I have gone

through the written submissions. My issuewise findings are as under.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">ISSUES NO. 1 &amp; 2</span>

</p><p id="p_13">9.         I will take up both the issues together as both these issues

are inter linked. It has been submitted on behalf of the petitioner that in

order to prove the Will, the petitioner has examined herself and the

attesting witness Shri A.S. Sohal.     There is no suggestion in cross

examination to the witnesses that Smt. Maya Kaur did not execute the

Will. The only suggestion put to PW1 is that the deceased wanted to

execute the Will in favour of her son Shri Ajit Pal Singh. The said

suggestion was denied by the petitioner. No evidence has been led by

the respondents to prove that the deceased wanted to execute the Will

in favour of Shri Ajit Pal Singh. It has been submitted that execution of
 (PC No.226/06)                               (<a href="/doc/4767/" id="a_7">Harjit Kaur vs. State &amp; Ors</a>.)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                         : 6:</span>


the Will has been admitted by the respondents. The onus to prove the

fraud or misrepresentation was on the respondents. They have not

given the particulars of the alleged fraud/ misrepresentation nor have

led any evidence to prove the same. It has also been submitted that in

the partition suit, the petitioner had filed her written statement

Ex.PW1/5. Thus, it came to the knowledge of the respondents that their

existed a Will of deceased, but they did not take any step for

cancellation of the Will by filing any suit or proceedings. The petitioner

has also challenged the affidavit filed in evidence by the respondents. It

has been submitted that the affidavits have not been filed in accordance

with requirement of Order 19 CPC and, therefore, affidavits filed by way

of evidence by the respondents are no affidavits in the eyes of law.

Petitioner has highlighted certain contradictions in the testimony of

respondents.     It has been submitted that the stand taken by the

respondents is false to their knowledge and that the Will stands proved.



</p><p id="p_14">10.        In their written submissions, the respondents have stated

that the Will dated 17.7.1980 was procured by the petitioner by

misrepresentation, fraudulently and mischievously and it came to the

knowledge of the respondents when the petitioner filed Suit No.101/85

for the grant of permanent injunction against her mother, brother and

brother-in-law. It has been stated that the mother of petitioner was alive

at that time and had filed her written statement denying any sale and

has explained in detail how the petitioner had played fraud upon her.
</p><p id="p_15"> (PC No.226/06)                               (<a href="/doc/4767/" id="a_8">Harjit Kaur vs. State &amp; Ors</a>.)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                         : 7:</span>


She had categorically stated in her written statement that she never

wanted to bequeath any part of the property in the house in favour of

petitioner and wanted to give the same to her only son. It has also

been stated that certified copy of written statement filed in Suit

No.101/85 could not be obtained by respondents because the record

has been destroyed in Record Room fire.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">11.        The onus to prove the Will is on the propounder and in the

absence of suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of the

Will, proof of testamentary capacity and the signature of the testator as

required by law is sufficient to discharge the onus. Where, however,

there are suspicious circumstances, the onus is on the propounder to

explain them to the satisfaction of the court before the court accepts the

Will as genuine. In order to prove the Will dated 17.7.1980, petitioner

has examined Shri Avtar Singh Sohal (attesting witness).           He has

deposed that the testatrix had signed the Will in his presence and had

requested him and Raghbir Singh to witness the Will. He identified the

signature and thumb impression of Smt. Maya Kaur at points A and B

on Will Ex.PW2/1, which according to him, were put in his presence by

the testatrix after understanding the contents of the Will. He identified

his own signature at point C and that of Shri Raghbir Singh at point B.

According to him, the Will was signed by the testatrix of her own free

will, accord and after understanding the contents of the same in his

presence as well as in the presence of other witness. He proved the
 (PC No.226/06)                             (<a href="/doc/4767/" id="a_9">Harjit Kaur vs. State &amp; Ors</a>.)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                          : 8:</span>


site plan attached with the Will as Ex.PW2/2. In cross examination, he

has stated that he is not aware as to who drafted and typed the Will.

He stated that he is not aware whether the Will was read over to Maya

Kaur or not by the person, who drafted it. According to him, the Will

was not read over in his presence.
</p>
<p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">12.        So far as the execution of the Will dated 17.7.1980 is

concerned, the same is not disputed by the respondents. Their main

objection is that the petitioner has procured the Will by fraud and

misrepresentation taking advantage of the fact that her mother was not

much educated. Their case is that the testatrix wanted to execute the

Will in favour of her son Ajit Pal Singh, but the petitioner took her to

court and got executed the sale documents of the property including the

Will in question fraudulently.
</p>
<p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">13.        In case of fraud, undue influence and coercion, the party

pleading it must set forth full particulars and the case can only be

decided on the particulars as laid. General allegations are insufficient

even to amount to an averment of fraud of which anybody ought to take

notice, however, strong the language, in which they are couched, and

the same applies to undue influence and coercion. In case of <a href="/doc/1479755/" id="a_10">Surender

Pal &amp; Ors. vs. Dr. Saraswati Arora &amp; Anr</a>., AIR 1974 SC 1999, it has

been held that where the caveator alleges undue influence, fraud and

coercion, the onus is on him to prove the same and if the caveator does
 (PC No.226/06)                               (<a href="/doc/4767/" id="a_11">Harjit Kaur vs. State &amp; Ors</a>.)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                         : 9:</span>


not discharge the burden, which rests upon him in establishing the

suspicious circumstances, which show that the Will had been obtained

by fraud or undue influence, probate is liable to be granted.



</p><p id="p_22">14.         Two things have to be proved in order to raise the

presumption of undue influence. Firstly, that the relationship between

the parties was such, that one was in a position to dominate the Will of

other. Secondly, that the position was used to obtain unfair advantage.

If these two things are proved, then a presumption of undue influence is

raised and the burden is cast upon the party to show that he has not

taken advantage of his position.
</p>
<p id="p_23">

</p><p id="p_24">15.         In this case, the petitioner has set forth the particulars of

fraud, misrepresentation/ undue influence. In cross examination, PW1

has admitted that she got divorce in 1964 and at that time, she had a

minor child. She has admitted that she was not having a place to reside

and, therefore, her mother took her to her house and gave one room to

live.   She has admitted in cross examination that she had filed an

injunction Suit No.1/85 against her mother in 1985. She has admitted

that the written statement was filed in the suit on behalf of her mother

stating that she does not want to give anything to her and that she had

got the documents fraudulently executed from her. The copy of written

statement has not been filed in this case, but that is understandable as

the record has been destroyed in Record Room fire, however, the fact
 (PC No.226/06)                                (<a href="/doc/4767/" id="a_12">Harjit Kaur vs. State &amp; Ors</a>.)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                         : 10 :</span>


remains that even during her life time, the testatrix herself had stated

before the court that the documents were got fraudulently executed

from her by the petitioner. Usually, the Will speaks from the death of

the testator, but in this case, the testatrix herself during her life time

pleaded fraud in the execution of Will in court proceedings filed against

her by the petitioner. What else could have been a better evidence

than this to prove the fraud in the execution of the Will? It has been

proved in evidence that the testatrix had allowed the petitioner to live at

her house as she had no other place to live after her divorce. Being the

daughter &amp; while living with the deceased, petitioner was in a position to

dominate the Will of her mother.       She played an active role in the

execution of the Will by accompanying her mother to court at the time of

execution of the Will. The possibility that she had used her position by

fraudulently getting the Will executed in her favour to her advantage

cannot be ruled out. In my view, in such a situations, it shall be highly

unsafe to rely on such a Will when the testatrix herself during her life

time challenged its genuineness. The very fact that the petitioner had

filed an injunction suit against her mother also proves that the relations

between petitioner and her mother were sour. In such a situation, it is

difficult to accept that she would execute the Will in favour of petitioner.

Under these circumstances, I am of the view that the Will dated
