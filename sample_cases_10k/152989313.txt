       IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA AT BANGALORE

           DATED THIS THE 3RD DAY OF JANUARY, 2013

                             BEFORE

        THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ASHOK B. HINCHIGERI

          WRIT PETITION No.27452/2012 (KLR-RR/SUR)

BETWEEN:

Muniraju,
S/o late Byrappa,
Age: 58 years,
Occ: Agri. &amp; Plumber,
R/o Gejjagadahalli Village,
Dasanapura Hobli,
Bangalore North Taluk-560 091.                        ...Petitioner

           (By Sri Hemant R.Chandangoudar, Advocate)

AND:

1.     The Special Deputy Commissioner,
       Bangalore District, K.G.Road,
       Bangalore-01.

2.     The Assistant Commissioner,
       Bangalore North Sub Division,
       Podium Block, Ambedkar Veedhi,
       Bangalore - 01.

3.     The Tahasildar,
       Bangalore North Taluk,
       Taluk Office, Bangalore - 01.           ... Respondents

            (By Sri R.B.Sathyanarayana Singh, HCGP)
                                 2


      This writ petition is filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution of India praying to quash the order dated
14.10.2009 passed by the respondent No.3 vide Annexure-K, the
order dated 23.9.2010 passed by the respondent No.2 vide
Annexure-L and the order dated 7.7.2012 passed by the
respondent No.1 vide Annexure-M and etc.

     This writ petition coming on for preliminary hearing in 'B'
group this day, the Court made the following:

                            ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner has raised a challenge to the Special

Tahsildar's order, dated 14.10.2009 (Annexure-K), the Assistant

Commissioner's order, dated 23.9.2010 (Annexure-L) and the

Deputy Commissioner's order, dated 7.7.2012 (Annexure-M).


</p><p id="p_2">      2.   The case of the petitioner in brief is that the land

measuring 2 acres standing at Survey No.11 of Gejjagadahalli

Village, Dasanapura Hobli, Bangalore North Taluk was granted to

one Sri Bettaiah under 'Grow More Food Scheme' vide grant-

order, dated 28.2.1962. The saguvali chit was issued to the said

Bettaiah on 31.3.1962. He sold it to Sri Byrappa by a registered

sale deed, dated 10.8.1970.     The name of the said purchaser

Byrappa was shown in the revenue records. The petitioner is the

son of the said Byrappa. The petitioner claims that the land has

fallen to his share in a family partition arrangement.     He has

sought the mutation entry in his favour in respect of the land in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                        3</span>


question.     The Special Tahsildar turned down the petitioner's

request suspecting that the land may not have been granted at

all.   Further, his order states that the petitioner has not

produced any original documents. The appeal filed against the

Special     Tahsildar's   order   is       dismissed   by   the   Assistant

Commissioner.      The Deputy Commissioner has also upheld the

orders passed by the Special Tahsildar and the Assistant

Commissioner by dismissing the petitioner's revision petition.


</p><p id="p_3">       3. This petition is filed for the relief of quashing the three

aforesaid orders and for the consequential direction in the nature

of mandamus for effecting the mutation entry in favour of the

petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">       4. Sri Hemant R.Chandangoudar, the learned counsel for

the petitioner submits that the petitioner produced the copies of

the grant-order and the saguvali chit.           He further submits that

subsequently the original grant-order was also placed before the

Special Tahsildar. However, he did not take the same on record.


</p><p id="p_6">       5. Sri R.B.Sathyanarayana Singh, the learned High Court

Government Pleader appearing for the respondents submits that

the impugned orders are passed on account of the failure of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        4</span>


petitioner to produce the originals. He submits that for the right

reasons the Special Tahsildar has formed the view that there is

no grant-order.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">          6. What is involved is the petitioner's precious right in the

immoveable property.            I am therefore of the considered view

that one more opportunity has to be given to the petitioner to

produce        the   original   grant-order,    without   going     into   the

controversy of whether it was produced or not produced.


</p><p id="p_9">          7.   For yet another reason too, I find that the matter

requires reconsideration.         It is not in dispute that the name of

the petitioner's father Byrappa was indeed reflected in the

revenue records in respect of the lands in question. If Byrappa

had not purchased the land from the original grantee, namely,

Bettaiah, there would have been no occasion for the revenue

authorities to show Byrappa's name in the revenue records. As

the petitioner only claims under Byrappa, it can be safely held

that his rights cannot be worse than the rights of Byrappa.


</p><p id="p_10">          8. The perusal of the Special Tahsildar's order reveals that

it   is    passed    on   surmises    and      conjectures.   The    revenue

authorities have to hold the enquiry with all seriousness for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  5</span>


ascertaining as to whether the land was granted or not granted.

If no records are available in the Special Tahsildar's office, the

contemporary records are to be obtained from the other

Government offices. The revenue authorities are not justified in

shutting out the petitioner on the ground that no grant-order is

available. They have to verify whether the copies of the grant-

orders made by the Deputy Commissioner were sent to the

offices of the Assistant Commissioner and the Special Tahsildar,

whether any amounts prescribed for the grant of land were

demanded from Bettaiah, who is said to be the original grantee,

as per the petitioner's version and were paid by him before the

issuance of the saguvali chit.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">      9. For all the aforesaid reasons, I allow this writ petition by

quashing the impugned orders and by directing the Special

Tahsildar to hold fresh enquiry in the matter. The petitioner is

directed to appear before the Special Tahsildar on 18.1.2013

without waiting for any notice from him. Further, the petitioner

is directed to produce the original grant-order before the Special

Tahsildar.   The Special Tahsildar shall take a decision on the

petitioner's request for effecting the mutation entry in his favour
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   6</span>


as expeditiously as possible and in any case within an outer limit

of three months from 18.1.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

costs.
