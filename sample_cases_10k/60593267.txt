Vijayapura in M.V.C.No.2182/2014 and enhance the

    This appeal coming on for admission this day,
RAGHVENDRA S. CHAUHAN J., delivered the following:

                      JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     Having suffered a fracture of the proximal shaft of

right femur, having been granted a compensation of

Rs.3,04,580/- along with 9% per annum, the appellant

has approached this court for enhancement of the

compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.    The brief facts of the case are that on

24.09.2014, the appellant, Yogesh @ Appa, was going

along with his friend Balasaheb Hari Phulare on a

motorcycle.   Their other friends, namely Anil Bhosale

and Vikas Bhosale, were also accompanying them on

another motorcycle.    While they were going on the

Kamati Kural Road, they stopped the motorcycle, and

they were standing on the left side of the motorcycle,

approximately 200 meters from the Dileep Petrol Pump,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             3</span>




at that time one Truck, bearing Reg.No.RJ-19/GA-3641,

came from behind, in a rash and negligent manner and

dashed against the petitioner, and his friend.    Due to

the impact, the appellant suffered injuries on different

parts of his body.   Immediately he was rushed to the

Yashodhara Super Specialty Hospital, Solapur where he

was an indoor patient for twenty-two days.             He

underwent operation for fractures suffered by him. Not

only a steel rod was implanted, but also nailing was

done. Thus, for his medical treatment he had to shell

out Rs.2,50,000/-.     According to him, prior to the

accident he was working as laundry man: after the

accident he finds it difficulty to carry on the said work.

Having recovered from the injuries sustained in the

accident, the appellant filed a claim petition before the

learned Tribunal.    In order to support his case, he

examined himself as PW1, and Dr. S.S.Nagathan as

PW2, and submitted four documents.          Although the

Insurance Company did not examined any witness, it

submitted four documents.        After adjudication, the

learned Tribunal granted the compensation as above
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   4</span>




mentioned.       Hence,    this   appeal   for   enhancement.



</p><p id="p_4">     3.      The learned counsel for the appellant has

raised the following contentions before this court:-


</p><p id="p_5">     Firstly, despite the fact that the appellant who was

a young man on his twenty-two years, he had suffered

grievous injuries on his head and in his eye, despite the

fact that he will continue to suffer pain throughout his

life, yet the compensation paid in the category of pain

and suffering is merely Rs.20,000/-.             Therefore the

compensation in the said category should be enhanced

by this court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">     Secondly, even for loss of amenities, life comforts,

and expectancy of life, a meager amount of Rs.20,000/-

has been granted as compensation by the learned

Tribunal. Therefore, the compensation in the said

category also deserves to be enhanced by this court.


</p><p id="p_8">     Thirdly, the learned Tribunal has granted a

compensation       of     Rs.1,42,900/-    for   the   medical
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                5</span>




expenses.     But the said amount also includes the

compensation for the categories of nourishing food and

attendant. Considering the fact that the appellant had

pleaded that he had incurred medical expenses to the

tune     of   Rs.2,50,000/-,       the   compensation     of

Rs.1,42,900/- does not include any compensation for

"attendant, and nourishing food". Considering the fact

that the appellant was hospitalized for twenty-two days,

considering the fact that he would be immobile for a few

months, and he would require an attendant, and

nourishing food when recovering, no compensation has

been paid to the appellant under the category of

"attendant,   and   nourishing     food".   Therefore    the

compensation is to be paid for the said category also.


</p><p id="p_9">       Fourthly, despite the fact that the accident had

occurred in the year 2014, in spite of the fact that

according to the Schedule prepared by this court for

assessing the notional income of an injured, the learned

Tribunal has ignored the said Schedule. For according

to the Schedule the notional income for an accident of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              6</span>




2017 is Rs.7,500/-.      But the learned Tribunal has

assess the notional income as merely Rs.6,000/-.

Therefore, while assessing "the loss of future income" on

account   of   permanent     disability,   the    income    of

Rs.7,500/-     should   be   taken,   instead      of   merely

Rs.6,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">     Lastly according to Dr. S.S.Nagathan (PW2), the

appellant has suffered 23 to 29% disability relating to

right lower limb. Thus for the whole body, the disability

should be taken as 10%. However, the learned Tribunal

has taken the disability as only 8%. Therefore the loss

of future income needs to be recalculated by this court.


</p><p id="p_12">     4.      On the other hand, the learned counsel for

the insurance Company, Mr. Shivanand Patil, has

pleaded that a      compensation award           is just and

reasonable.    Moreover, a compensation award is not

meant to be a bonanza for the claimant. According to

the learned counsel, the compensation paid for the

category of "pain and suffering" and "loss of amenities"

as Rs.20,000/- each is more than just and reasonable.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             7</span>




Therefore, the learned counsel has supported the

impugned award.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">      5.    Heard the learned counsel for the both the

parties, and perused the impugned award.


</p><p id="p_15">      6.    Admittedly    the      appellant    was    only

twenty-two years old when he met with the accident.

Undoubtedly, he had suffered injuries both in the head,

in his lower limb.   The fracture of the femur would

continue to cause pain during the mansoon throughout

his life.   Therefore the compensation paid in the

category of "pain and suffering" i.e. merely Rs.20,000/-

needs to be enhanced from Rs.20,000/- to Rs.40,000/-.


</p><p id="p_16">      7.    Undoubtedly    while     the   appellant   was

recovering from his injuries, since he has suffered

fracture of femur bone, the appellant required an

attendant to look after his daily needs.       Moreover, in

order to the hasten the recovery, the appellant required

nourishing food. According to the appellant, he had

incurred Rs.2,50,000/- for his medical treatment. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                    8</span>




learned Tribunal has granted him merely Rs.1,47,900/-

for the medical expenses including future medical

expenses, "attendant, and nourishing food". Therefore,

obviously no compensation has been paid for "an

attendant and nourishing food" that the appellant had

required during his recovery period.                Therefore, this

court        grants   the    appellant       a   compensation     of

Rs.10,000/- for "the attendant and nourishing food".


</p><p id="p_17">        8.      In catena of cases, this court has directed

the Tribunals to follow the Schedule prepared by this

court while assessing the notional income of an injured

or a deceased person. According to the Schedule, for an

accident 2014, the notional income is Rs.7,500/- per

month. However the learned Tribunal has assessed the

notional income as just Rs.6,000/-.                  Therefore the

notional       income   is   increased       from   Rs.6,000/-    to

Rs.7,500/-.
</p>
<p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">        9.      According     to       the   testimony    of     the

Dr. S.S.Nagathan as PW2. The appellant has suffered a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                               9</span>




disability of 29% in the lower limb. Therefore the extent

of disability for the whole body is 10%, yet the learned

Tribunal has taken the extent of disability as 8%.

Therefore, even the extent of disability needs to be

enhanced from 8% to 10%.           Hence the loss of future

income needs to be re-calculated by this Court. It is as

under:
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">      7500 X 12 X 18 X 10% = Rs.1,62,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">      10.    Therefore the compensation in category of

"loss of future income" on account of permanent

disability   is   enhanced        from   Rs.1,03,680/-   to

Rs.1,62,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">      11.    For the reasons stated above, the impugned

award is modified as under:
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><pre id="pre_2">                            As awarded by     As awarded
