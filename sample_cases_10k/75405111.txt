                                      W.P. 20818(W) of 2010


         Ms. Sabita Khutia,
                                ... for the petitioner

         Mr. Chowdhury F Ali,
                                      ... for the State


         1.</pre><p id="p_1">          The petitioner is a retired assistant teacher of a non-
         Government aided school. He claims interest on delayed payment of
         gratuity.
</p>

<p id="p_2">         2.          Ms.    Khutia,    learned   Advocate   for   the    petitioner       has
         placed before this Court a decision dated 01.07.2008 passed by the
         Hon'ble Justice Tapen Sen while disposing of W.P. No. 10750(W) of
         2007.
</p>

<p id="p_3">         3.              I find from the said order that the submission of the
         learned Advocate General for the State of West Bengal, Mr. B.C.
         Roy has been recorded to the effect that he "very frankly and
         fairly stated that so far as the gratuity is concerned, it has to
         be paid on the date the person retires with the only exception
         that it can be withheld in cases where a departmental action is
         pending against the concerned employee."
</p>

<p id="p_4">         4.          The stand of the State Government that gratuity is due
         and payable from the date of retirement and not from any other
         date and that pending departmental action could only be a bar for
         release of gratuity, is the correct position in law.
</p>

<p id="p_5">         5.          It further appears from the said order that an order
         dated    28.03.2005    passed    by   the   Division   Bench    of   this    Court
         presided over by the Hon'ble the Chief Justice was taken into
         consideration wherein the State Government agreed to                 awarding of
         interest by the Court on delayed payment of gratuity @ 10% per
         annum.    His    Lordship,    further   noticing   the   said    order      of   the
         Division Bench, held that interest of justice would be sub-served
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                  2</span>




if   interest      @     10%    per     annum    from       the    date   of   retirement      is
directed to be made over to the petitioner. The operative part of
the order reads as follows:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "However, this Court makes it clear that such interest must
      certainly be handed over and paid to the Petitioners on the
      expiry of the 90th (ninetieth) day from the date of receipt of
      a copy of this Order along with a copy of this Writ Petition
      which must be served (as has been submitted by the learned
      Advocate         General        himself)       upon     the     Secretary,       Finance,
      Government of West Bengal. Once such service is made upon the
      Secretary referred to above, the said officer will take all
      necessary steps to ensure compliance of this Order within the
      time       fixed     by    this     Court       as     above     failing     which,      an
      additional interest @ 2%                             per annum will be payable to
      the petitioners."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_6">6.           I    have     been       informed       that    the    said   order       has   been
accepted by the State Government and no appeal has been preferred
thereagainst.
</p>

<p id="p_7">7.           The       said     order    having      attained        finality,     I    find   no
reason to take a different view. There shall be similar order on
this petition regarding grant of interest on delayed payment of
gratuity as passed in W.P. No. 10750(W) of 2007.
</p>

<p id="p_8">8.           The petitioner is granted liberty to serve a copy of
this order along with a copy of the writ petition on the Director
of Pension, Provident Fund and Group Insurance, who shall hand
over the cheque for the amount constituting interest at 10% per
annum with effect from the date of retirement of the petitioner
till release of gratuity, within four months from date of such
receipt, failing which additional interest @ 2% will be payable to
the petitioner.
</p>

<p id="p_9">9.           The writ petition stands disposed of without any order
as to costs.

<p id="p_10">10.       Urgent   certified   photostat   copy   of   this   order,   if
applied for, be supplied to the parties at an early date.
</p>
