<p id="p_1">Dr. Mukundakam Sharma, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">1. Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">2. The present appeals are directed against the judgment and order dated

   3.7.2006 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of

   Allahabad.     By the common judgment and order, we propose to

   dispose of both the said appeals.

</p><p id="p_6">3. The High Court by the said order allowed the Writ Petition filed by

   Mohd. Sohrab Khan and set aside the Office Memo dated 20.05.2004

   issued by the University regarding appointment of Merajuddin

   Ahmed, as a Lecturer in Chemistry in University Polytechnic, Aligarh

   Mulsim University, Aligarh.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">4. Mohd. Sohrab Khan filed the said Writ Petition challenging the

   aforesaid appointment and also seeking for a direction that he be

   appointed to the said post on the basis of his selection by the

   Selection Committee. Since by the said judgment and order the High

   Court set aside the appointment of the appellant Merajuddin Ahmed

   but, however, as High Court did not grant a direction as sought for by

   Mohd. Sohrab Khan, therefore, two appeals came to be filed in this

   Court on which we have heard the counsel appearing for the parties.

   We have also heard the learned counsel appearing for the Aligarh

   Muslim University.      In order to deal with the contentions raised in

   both the appeals, it would be necessary to deal herein with some of

   the relevant facts leading to the filing of the writ petition.



</p><p id="p_9">5. Aligarh Muslim University issued an advertisement through

   Advertisement No. 2 of 2004 dated 6.2.2004 whereby it called for

   applications for filling up about 79 posts in the University.    One of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 Page 2 of 15</span>
   the said posts which was advertised was the post of Lecturer in

   Chemistry in University Polytechnic, Aligarh Muslim University.

   Qualification that was laid down by the University as essential

   qualification was a First Class Masters' Degree in the appropriate

   branch of teaching post in Humanities and Sciences. Both Mohd.

   Sohrab Khan as also Merajuddin Ahmad submitted their applications

   to be considered as against the aforesaid post which was advertised

   namely Lecturer in Chemistry. Mohd. Sohrab Khan had a First Class

   Masters' Degree in Chemistry (Pure) whereas Merajuddin Ahmad was

   holding a First Class Masters Degree in Industrial Chemistry.



      The University Authority, however, called both of them for the

interview.   The Selection Committee which was constituted for the

purpose of selecting the suitable candidate selected Merajuddin Ahmad

on the ground that he would be more suitable to the aforesaid post as he

holds a Masters Degree in Industrial Chemistry which according to them

would be best suited to teach the particular subject for the University

Polytechnic, Aligarh Muslim University.       The University Authority

accepted the aforesaid recommendation of the Selection Committee and

issued an order of appointment in favour of Merajuddin Ahmad.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              Page 3 of 15</span>
</p><p id="p_10">6. Mohd. Sohrab Khan, being aggrieved by the aforesaid order passed

   by the Aligarh Muslim University filed a writ petition in the High

   Court of Allahabad.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">7. The Division Bench of the High Court of Allahabad heard the

   aforesaid Writ Petition and by a judgment and order dated 3.7.2006

   allowed the aforesaid writ petition holding that the aforesaid

   appointment of Merajuddin Ahmad to the said post is not legal as he

   did not possess the minimum qualification. The High Court

   consequently set aside the order of appointment with a direction to the

   respondent-University to initiate fresh selection process for the

   aforesaid post giving liberty to the University to reconsider the

   essential qualification for the post, in question. The High Court while

   coming to the aforesaid conclusion clearly recorded that the

   University award degrees separately in both subjects Chemistry as

   well as Industrial Chemistry and that both the subjects are distinct and

   separate.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

      By referring to the course structure of Graduate and Post Graduate

classes in Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry, the High Court came to

the conclusion that the courses of the aforesaid two subjects are quite

different and distinct and in the light of the aforesaid findings, it also

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               Page 4 of 15</span>
recorded that degree of M.Sc. in Industrial Chemistry cannot be equated

with the degree of M.Sc. in Chemistry.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">      The High Court referred to the decision of this Court in Dr. Bhanu

Prasad Panda Vs. Chancellor, Sambalpur University and Others [(2001)

8 SCC 532] for coming to the conclusion that the eligibility

qualifications cannot be ignored. The High Court of Allahabad held that

the facts of the present case are similar to that of the abovementioned

case wherein there was an advertisement for the post of Lecturer in

Political Science and it was held that the person having degree in Public

Administration cannot be appointed.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">8. The contention that is raised on behalf of Merajuddin Ahmad is that

   the selection committee being constituted of experts on the subjects

   was the only competent authority to decide that the person holding

   Masters Degree in Industrial Chemistry is best suited for teaching the

   subject for which advertisement was issued and the High Court acted

   illegally and without jurisdiction in interfering with the aforesaid

   opinion of the experts by substituting its own decision.



      It was also submitted that the Masters Degree in Industrial

Chemistry is as good as Masters Degree in Chemistry for the post for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               Page 5 of 15</span>
which the advertisement was issued and that a person having Masters

Degree in Industrial Chemistry was better suited for teaching the said

subject. Learned counsel also invited our attention to the course contents

which the teacher appointed to the said post was required to teach.

Relying on the same, he submitted that a candidate having Masters

Degree in Industrial Chemistry would have been better suited to teach the

said subjects constituting the course contents.



</p><p id="p_18">9. Learned Counsel appearing for Mohd. Sohrab refuted the aforesaid

   submissions and contended that for teaching Chemistry to Diploma

   students only the basic knowledge of Chemistry is required and

   therefore a person holding a Masters Degree in pure Chemistry is

   better suited to teach the said subject. It was also submitted by him

   that Masters Degree in Industrial Chemistry is quite distinct and

   separate from pure Chemistry which is a separate subject altogether

   and therefore recommendation made by the Selection Committee and

   the appointment made by the University was against the requirements

   and norms laid down in the advertisement issued by the University

   and therefore the same was rightly set aside by the High Court.



      Learned Counsel also submitted that since Mohd. Sohrab Khan

was placed at serial No. 2 and the appointment of Merajuddin Ahmad

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                Page 6 of 15</span>
was found to be illegal and therefore non est and nullity, Mohd. Sohrab

Khan who was placed at serial No. 2 could have directly been appointed.

It was submitted that as the same has not been done the second part of

the judgment of the High Court be set aside and a direction by this Court

to appoint Mohd. Sohrab Khan on the said post be issued.



</p><p id="p_19">10.According to the advertisement issued by the University, post in

   Chemistry had fallen vacant and in order to fill up the said post,

   applications were invited.    In the advertisement it is clearly stated

   that what is advertised is a post of lecturer in Chemistry. Therefore, it

   would be necessarily assumed that candidates possessing a Masters

   Degree in pure Chemistry should submit their application as against

   the     aforesaid post.
</p>
<p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">11.We have gone through the aforesaid advertisement which was issued

   for filling up various posts and on scrutiny, we find that whenever and

   wherever the University desired to fill up a post at variance with the

   main subject, it is specifically notified and indicated in the said

   advertisement. For example, advertisement which find place at Serial

   No. 59 was for filling up the post of Lecturer in Civil Engineering

   (Environmental Engg.) for University Polytechnic for which

   qualification which was necessary and essential was mentioned as

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                Page 7 of 15</span>
   First Class Bachelor's Degree in Environmental / Civil Chemical /

   Petroleum / Biochemical Engineering/ Architecture.



</p><p id="p_22">12.Many more posts advertised in the said advertisement specifically

   indicate that whenever the University desired to have a post filled up

   in a particular branch of the Humanities and Science Department, it

   specifically indicated as such in the said advertisement.      If it was

   necessary for the University to fill up the post from the stream of

   Industrial Chemistry, it would have so indicated in the advertisement

   itself for in subsequent years, we find specific advertisement has been

   issued by the same University for filling up the post of Lecturer in

   Industrial Chemistry by issuing an advertisement specifically in

   that regard.
</p>
<p id="p_23">

</p><p id="p_24">13.There is no doubt with regard to the fact that it is the University

   Authority who knows best as to what is their requirement. Aligarh

   Muslim University was founded by <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_1">Central Act</a> called the <a href="/doc/892594/" id="a_2">Aligarh

   Muslim University Act</a>. It also has a statute made under <a href="/doc/1757215/" id="a_3">Section 28</a>

   (1) of the said Act. Statute 22 of the University deals with the Boards

   of Studies. One of the functions of the said Board of Studies is to

   recommend to the Faculty in the manner prescribed in the ordinances,

   the field of study of each post at the time of its creation.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                 Page 8 of 15</span>
</p><p id="p_25">14.Statute 21 on the other hand deals with the powers and functions of

   the Faculties. The aforesaid recommendation of the Board of Studies

   is to be decided by the Faculties at Statute 21 of the University and

   therefore, it is confirmed by the Academic Council under Statute 19

   of the University, and therefore it is to be approved by the Executive

   Council under Statute 17(2)(1) of the University.         After such a

   repeated multi-tier exercise, the essential qualification is earmarked

   for a particular post and then it is advertised.   It is also established

   from the records and there is no dispute with regard to the fact that

   pure Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry are two different and

   separate subjects.
</p>
<p id="p_26">

</p><p id="p_27">15.Learned counsel appearing for Merajuddin Ahmad strongly relied

   upon the course contents.    A bare look at the same would indicate

   that what is dealt therein is not Industrial Chemistry but Engineering

   Chemistry.      We are not informed as to whether Engineering

   Chemistry is considered to be at par with Industrial Chemistry.



</p><p id="p_28">16.Learned Counsel appearing for the University on our enquiry fairly

   stated before us that the aforesaid post which was advertised to be

   filled up in the aforesaid manner is at present vacant and the same is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                               Page 9 of 15</span>
  being manned by appointing a Guest Lecturer who holds a Masters

  Degree in pure Chemistry.
</p>
<p id="p_29">

</p><p id="p_30">17.If the requirement was to have a person having Masters Degree in

  Industrial Chemistry, then in that event the post would have been

  manned through a Guest Lecturer from the Industrial Chemistry

  stream.   Therefore, it cannot be accepted that the person holding a

  Masters Degree in Industrial Chemistry would be better suited for

  appointment as against the said post.
</p>
<p id="p_31">

</p><p id="p_32">18.The post advertised was meant for a person belonging to the pure

  Chemistry Department for if it was otherwise, then it would have been

  so mentioned in the advertisement itself that a person holding a

  Masters Degree in Industrial Chemistry should only apply or that a

  person holding such a degree could also apply alongwith other

  persons. It was not so mentioned in the advertisement and therefore,

  except for Merajuddin Ahmad, no other degree holder in Industrial

  Chemistry had applied for becoming a candidate as against the

  aforesaid post.
</p>
<p id="p_33">

</p><p id="p_34">19.According to us, the Selection Committee as also the University

  changed the rule in the midstream which was not permissible. The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                              Page 10 of 15</span>
   University can always have a person as a Lecturer in a particular

   discipline that it desires to have, but the same must be specifically

   stated in the advertisement itself, so that there is no confusion and all

   persons who could be intending candidates, should know as to what is

   the subject which the person is required to teach and what essential

   qualification the person must possess to be suitable for making

   application for filling up the said post.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">20.We are not disputing the fact that in the matter of selection of

   candidates, opinion of the Selection Committee should be final, but at

   the same time, the Selection Committee cannot act arbitrarily and

   cannot change the criteria/qualification in the selection process during

   its midstream. Merajuddin Ahmad did not possess a degree in pure

   Chemistry and therefore, it was rightly held by the High Court that he

   did not possess the minimum qualification required for filling up the

   post of Lecturer Chemistry, for pure Chemistry and Industrial

   Chemistry are two different subjects.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">21.The advertisement which was issued for filling up the post of Lecturer

   in Chemistry could not have been filled up by a person belonging to

   the subject of Industrial Chemistry when the same having been

   specifically not mentioned in the advertisement that a Masters Degree



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                Page 11 of 15</span>
   holder in the said subject would also be suitable for being considered.

</p><p id="p_39">         There could have been intending candidates who would have

   applied for becoming candidate as against the said advertised post,

   had they known and were informed through advertisement that

   Industrial Chemistry is also one of the qualifications for filling up the

   said post.   The Selection Committee during the stage of selection,

   which is midway could not have changed the essential qualification

   laid down in the advertisement and at that stage held that a Masters

   Degree Holder in Industrial Chemistry would be better suited for

   manning the said post without there being any specific advertisement

   in that regard. The very fact that the University is now manning the

   said post by having a person from the discipline of pure Chemistry

   also leads to the conclusion that the said post at that stage when it was

   advertised was meant to be filled up by a person belonging to pure

   Chemistry stream.
</p>
<p id="p_40">

   SCC 154] at para 14 it was held by this Court that norms of selection

   cannot be altered after commencement of selection process and the

   rules regarding qualification for appointment, if amended, during

   continuation of the process of selection do not affect the same.

   Further at para 15 it was held that the power to relax the eligibility


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                               Page 12 of 15</span>
   condition, if any, to the selection must be clearly spelt out and cannot

   be otherwise exercised. The said observations are extracted herein

   below:
</p>
<p id="p_42">    "14. The High Court has committed an error in holding that the
    amended rule was operative. As has been fairly conceded by
    learned counsel for Respondent 1 applicant it was the
    unamended rule which was applicable. Once a process of
    selection starts, the prescribed selection criteria cannot be
    changed. The logic behind the same is based on fair play. A
    person who did not apply because a certain criterion e.g.
    minimum percentage of marks can make a legitimate grievance,
    in case the same is lowered, that he could have applied because
    he possessed the said percentage. Rules regarding qualification
    for appointment if amended during continuance of the process
    of selection do not affect the same. That is because every statute
    or statutory rule is prospective unless it is expressly or by
    necessary implication made to have retrospective effect. Unless
    there are words in the statute or in the rules showing the
    intention to affect existing rights the rule must be held to be
    prospective. If the rule is expressed in a language which is fairly
    capable of either interpretation it ought to be considered as
    prospective only. (<a href="/doc/1730767/" id="a_5">See P. Mahendran v. State of Karnataka</a>
    (1990) 1 SCC 411 and <a href="/doc/747426/" id="a_6">Gopal Krushna Rath v. M.A.A. Baig</a>
    (1999) 1 SCC 544.)

</p><p id="p_43">    15. Another aspect which this Court has highlighted is scope for
    relaxation of norms. Although the Court must look with respect
    upon the performance of duties by experts in the respective
    fields, it cannot abdicate its functions of ushering in a society
    based on rule of law. Once it is most satisfactorily established
    that the Selection Committee did not have the power to relax
    essential qualification, the entire process of selection so far as
    the selected candidate is concerned gets vitiated. <a href="/doc/1364553/" id="a_7">In P.K.
    Ramachandra Iyer v. Union of India</a> (1984) 2 SCC 141 this
    Court held that once it is established that there is no power to
    relax essential qualification, the entire process of selection of
    the candidate was in contravention of the established norms
    prescribed by advertisement. The power to relax must be clearly
    spelt out and cannot otherwise be exercised."

<a href="/doc/128748631/" id="a_8">In Krushna Chandra Sahu (Dr) v. State of Orissa</a>, [(1995) 6 SCC 1], at

para 34 it was held by this Court the Selection Committee does not even


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                               Page 13 of 15</span>
have the inherent jurisdiction to lay down the norms for selection nor can

such power be assumed by necessary implication. In the said case

reference was made to the decision in <a href="/doc/1364553/" id="a_9">P. K. Ramachandra Iyer v. Union

of India</a> [(1984) 2 SCC 141], wherein at para 44 it was observed:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">    "By necessary inference, there was no such power in the ASRB
    to add to the required qualifications. If such power is claimed, it
    has to be explicit and cannot be read by necessary implication
    for the obvious reason that such deviation from the rules is
    likely to cause irreparable and irreversible harm."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_45">23.After analysing the present issue in the light of the abovesaid legal

   proposition laid down by this Court we hold that the High Court was

   justified in rejecting the candidature of Merajuddin Ahmad as against

   the said post which was advertised for pure Chemistry stream.

   However, with the appointment of Merajuddin Ahmad to the said

   post, the list recommended by the Selection Committee and approved

   by the other competent authority has lapsed.     We, therefore, uphold

   the order passed by the High Court giving liberty to the University to

   lay down the qualification necessary for filling up the aforesaid post.

   The University shall now advertise the said post by laying down exact

   essential qualification indicating the particular subject and subjects-

   stream which is required to be possessed for making an application to

   fill up the said post and therefore proceed to appoint a Lecturer

   suitable for the   aforesaid post.
