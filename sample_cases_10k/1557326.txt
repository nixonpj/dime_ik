ORAL ORDER</pre> 

 

<p id="p_1">(Per
: HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE K.A.PUJ)
 


 


 
	  

The
	Commissioner of Central Excise, Bhavnagar has filed this Tax Appeal
	under <a href="/doc/54762929/" id="a_1">Section 35-G</a> of the Central Excise Act, 1944 proposing to
	formulate the following substantial question of law for the
	determination and consideration of this Court :-
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_2"> Whether
CESTAT was correct in holding that the decision of the Commissioner
(Appeals) to impose penalty equivalent to the amount of duty confined
under <a href="/doc/92590795/" id="a_2">Section 11AC</a> of the Act is not warranted and accordingly
allowing the appeal of the respondent ? 
</p> 


		
 


 


 
	  

<p id="p_3">Heard
	Mr. Y. N. Ravani, learned Standing Counsel appearing for the Revenue
	and perused the orders passed by the authorities below.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_4">The
	Assistant Commissioner of the Central Excise, after issuance of the
	show-cause notice passed an order on 31.10.2007 confirming the
	demand of Rs.62,373/- under Rule 14 of the Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004
	read with <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_3">Section 11</a> A of the Central Excise Act, 1944.  He also
	directed that the respondent   assessee to pay interest at the
	appropriate rate on the amount reversed from the date of detection
	of the case to the date of payment i.e. 25.12.2004 to 31.12.2004
	under Section 11 AB of the Central Excise Act, 1944.   He further
	imposed the penalty of Rs.10,000/- on the respondent   assessee
	under <a href="/doc/17002337/" id="a_4">Section 25</a> (1) (b) of the Central Excise Rules, 2002 and also
	imposed penalty of Rs.10,000/- under Rule 15 (1) of the Cenvat
	Credit Rules, 2004.  While passing the said order, he has
	specifically held that since there is no case of clandestine removal
	of finished goods on records and also no suppression of facts and
	circumstances to evade payment of duty of excise are noticed, he did
	not find any short levy or short payment of duty of excise and
	hence, penal action against the respondent   assessee under
	Section 11 AC of the Act was not attracted.  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_5">The
	Revenue, being aggrieved by the said order, preferred Appeal before
	the Commissioner (Appeals) who has observed in his order dated
	27.05.2008, on the basis of the statement of Mr. Hitesh Chimanlal
	Shah, Manager and Authorized Signatory of the respondent  
	assessee recorded during the investigation that it was clear that
	the respondent was aware of the shortage of goods and yet, they
	continued to avail Cenvat Credit on the goods not actually received
	and also the respondent was not reversing the proportionate Cenvat
	Credit on their own volition and paying / reversing the same only on
	being caught by the department.  He has further observed that the
	malafide intention of the respondent was, therefore, established and
	the facts of the case satisfied the ingredient for imposition of
	penalty under Section 11 AC of the Act.  He, therefore, modified the
	order in original to the extent of imposing the penalty equal to the
	amount of duty confirmed.  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_6">This
	order was challenged by the respondent   assessee before the
	Tribunal and the Tribunal vide its order dated 02.06.2009 upheld the
	order of Assistant Commissioner holding therein that there was no
	admission of clandestine removal which is a serious charge in the
	present case also.  The Tribunal, therefore, held that the decision
	of the Commissioner (Appeals) to impose penalty under Section 11 AC
	is not warranted under the circumstances and accordingly set aside
	the order of the Commissioner (Appeals).  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_7">We
	have considered the submissions made by Mr. Ravani and also perused
	the orders of the authorities below.  We are of the view that the
	learned Assistant Commissioner has clearly recorded the finding that
	there is no clandestine removal nor there is short levy of duty and
	hence, he has not invoked the penal provisions under <a href="/doc/92590795/" id="a_5">Section 11AC</a> of
	the Act.  Even otherwise, when Section 11 AC is not applicable,
	there is no question of levying any penalty under that Section.  The
	Commissioner has simply relied on the statement of Mr. Hitesh C.
	Shah.  However, on the basis of the said statement, it cannot be
	said that there was an intention to evade the payment of duty.  We
	are, therefore, of the view that the Tribunal has rightly set aside
	the order passed by the Commissioner (Appeals).
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_8">Even
	the original Adjudicating Authority as well as the final fact
	finding authority have come to the conclusion that when ingredients
	of Section 11 AC are not satisfied, there is no question of levying
	any penalty under that Section.  
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_9">In
	view of the above, we see no justification in interfering in the
	order passed by the Tribunal.  We are of the view that no question
	of law, much less any substantial question of law, arises out of the
	order of the Tribunal and hence, we dismiss this appeal.
