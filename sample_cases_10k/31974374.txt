</p><p id="p_3">     It is submitted by the counsel for the applicant that the
applicant is the mother in law of the deceased. There is no
allegation that the deceased was ever harassed or treated with
cruelty because of non fulfillment of any demand of dowry. It is
submitted that the deceased was suffering from Tuberculosis
and proper treatment was not given to her and whenever the
relatives of the deceased had requested that proper treatment
should be provided to the deceased, then it was replied by the
applicant and other co-accused persons that since sufficient
dowry has not been given and until and unless money is paid to
the accused persons they would not keep the deceased
properly. It is submitted that there is no allegation against the
applicant that he had ever demanded any dowry or had
harassed the deceased. In fact the deceased was suffering from
Tuberculosis and it appears that she committed suicide only
because of her disease. The applicant is in jail since 25.07.2017
and trial is likely to take sufficiently long time. There is no
possibility of her absconding or tampering with the prosecution
