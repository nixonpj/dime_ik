                                  JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.      This  is a suit  filed under Order 37 of CPC by plaintiff for 

        recovery   of   a   liquidated   sum   of   Rs.11,625/­   along   with 

        interest.   After   the   summons   of   the   suit   were   issued   to 

        defendant in the prescribed form as defined under Order   37 

        (2) (Sub Rule 2) defendant has not entered her appearance. 

</p><p id="p_2">2.      Defendant remained absent despite service of summons upon 

        her   on   20.12.2010   at  D­1/96,   Rabindra   Nagar,   New 

        Delhi­110003 .
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.      I   have   heard   learned   counsel   for   plaintiff   at   considerable 

        length and have perused the record. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.      The suit is instituted through Shri Chandra Shekhar on behalf 

        of plaintiff company which is dealing in International Mobile 

        Rental   Services.   It   is   stated   that   defendant   had   applied   for 

        International Mobile Connection in South Delhi and procured 

        the   Standard   Application   form   containing   the   terms   &amp; 

        conditions   regarding  the usage of  connection  and agreed  to 

        abide by the same. As per the accounts maintained by plaintiff 

        company,   an   outstanding   amount  of   Rs.11,625/­   is  due  and 

        payable by the defendant towards the International Mobile No.

         07956678750 but despite repeated reminders and request, the 

        defendant intentionally and deliberately failed to pay the same 

        with ulterior motives. The suit is based on an agreement form 

        dated   25.04.2007   which   is   placed   on   record   in   original   by 

        plaintiff hence the same is covered within the provisions of 

        Order 37 CPC and is also tendered within limitation. 

</p><p id="p_5">5.      There   is   no   relief   claimed   by   plaintiff   which   does   not   fall 

        within the ambit of the provisions of Order, 37 CPC.     

</p><p id="p_6">6.      It is useful to refer the relevant provisions of law which are as 

        under:­

            Order XXXVII Rule  3(1) CPC.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            (1)     In   a   suit   to   which   this   Order   applies,   the 

            plaintiff   shall, together with the summons under 

            rule 2, serve on the defendant a copy of the plaint 

            and annexures thereto and the defendant may, at 

            any time within ten days of such services, enter an 

            appearance either in person  or by pleader and, in 

            either  case,  he  shall  file in  court     an   address  for 

            service of notice on him.

             Order XXXVII Rule 2(3) CPC.
</p>
<p id="p_9">            (3) The defendant shall not defend the suit referred 

            to  in  sub­ rule(1) unless he enters an appearance 

            and   in   default   of   his   entering   an   appearance   the 

            allegations   in   the   plaint   shall   be   deemed   to   be 

            admitted   and   the  plaintiff  shall   be   entitled   to   a 

            decree   for   any   sum,   not   exceeding   the   sum 

            mentioned in the summons, together with interest 

            at the rate specified, if any,   up to the date of the 

            decree   and   such   sum   for   costs   as   may   be 

            determined by the Hon'ble High Court   from time 

            to   time   by   rules   made   in   that   behalf   and   such 

            decree may be executed forthwith.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.      In view of the above mentioned provisions of law, it is clear 

        that if the defendant makes default in entering her appearance 

        within ten days from the date of service of summons upon her 

        the allegations as levelled in the plaint shall be deemed to be 

        admitted and the plaintiff shall be entitled to a decree.  As per 

        record,   the   defendant   stood   served   with   the   summons   in

         prescribed performa by way of affixation on 20.12.2010. Till 

        date, no appearance has been entered into by the defendant and 

        accordingly the allegations levelled in the plaint are deemed to 

        be admitted by the defendant, entitling the plaintiff to a decree 

        straightway.
</p>
<p id="p_11">8.      Hence,   in   the   given   circumstances,   suit   of   the  plaintiff  is 

        decreed with costs against defendant.  Defendant  is  directed 

        to pay a sum of Rs.11,625/­ to  the plaintiff with interest @8% 

        per annum   from the date of filing of the suit till the date of
