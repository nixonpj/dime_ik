(Vikash Kumar Shukla Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh &amp; othrs.)



22/11/2013.
          Shri V.K. Shukla, learned counsel for
the petitioner.
          Shri Sanjeev Kumar Singh, Panel
Lawyer for the respondent nos. 1 to 5/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">          Shri Sanjay Singh, learned counsel for
respondent No. 6.
</p><p id="p_2">          Shri K.C. Ghildiyal, learned counsel for
the interveners.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            Challenging the order Annexure P/7
dated     11/06/2012,      the   petitioner       an    elected
Sarpanch has filed this writ petition and                    it is
stated     that     the      order     passed          by     the
Commissioner is unsustainable. It is seen that in
the matter of distribution of             benefits under a
statutory schemes, certain irregularities are said
to have been committed. Based on the complaint
received, action is proposed to be taken against
the petitioner, a Sarpanch and the Secretary and
certain     government        officials    also    who        are
involved in the matter.
</p><p id="p_4">            It is the case of the petitioner that on
the complaint initially an inquiry was conducted
by the Sub Divisional Officer and vide his report
Annexure P/2 dated 31/01/2012 the SDO had
found that no irregularity was committed and
therefore, the matter was closed. Thereafter,
another inquiry       was     conducted by         the      Naib
Tehsildar     and    report      Annexure         P/4       dated
31-01-2012/ 04-02-2012 was submitted wherein
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                           W.P. No. 9038/2012.                 2</span>


(Vikash Kumar Shukla Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh &amp; othrs.)



allegations of irregularities were made against
the petitioner. It is stated that this report was
forwarded for inquiry at the instance of the Chief
Executive     Officer       vide    Annexure      P/5      dated
06/03/2012. It is stated that inspite of three
inquiry have been conducted, further inquiry as
directed     by     the     impugned        order     by     the
Commissioner is unsustainable.
</p><p id="p_5">            It is emphasized by Shri V.K. Shukla,
learned     counsel         for    petitioner       that     the
Commissioner has directed for taking action
which is impermissible as no action can be taken
now in the light of exoneration in the earlier
inquiries conducted.
</p><p id="p_6">            Shri K.C. Ghildiyal, and Shri Sanjay
Singh, learned counsel refuted the same and
submitted that Commissioner has only directed
for conducting a proper inquiry into the matter,
it is pointed out that the officers who have
conducted      the    inquiry       and    exonerated        the
petitioner were also involved in the matter. It is
further     stated        by      the     interveners       that
Commissioner has got some inquiry conducted
into the matter through Deputy Director and the
report Annexure I/1 dated 11/06/2012 submitted
in   the   office    of     the    Commissioner,        certain
irregularities       have      been     pointed     out     and
therefore , it is the case of the interveners that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                           W.P. No. 9038/2012.                3</span>


(Vikash Kumar Shukla Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh &amp; othrs.)



on these grounds rerferred, interference into the
matter is not called for.
</p><p id="p_7">           Having heard the rival contentions, it
is seen that by the impugned Annexure P/7 dated
11/06/2012 the Commissioner, Rewa has only
issued    certain    directions.      According      to   the
petitioner the directions contained in this order
Annexure P/7 is unsustainable for the reasons
that in inquiries, more than three                   already
conducted petitioner has been exonerated. The
respondents      have     refuted    the    aforesaid     and
submitted     that   in    a   further     inquiry   by   the
Commissioner himself there are indication                 that
the petitioner and other officers are involved in
the matter. It is the case of the respondents that
it is a case where the Commissioner has taken
into consideration all the facts and the inquiries
report before he took a decision. It is seen that
while issuing the directions as contained in
Annexure P/7, the Commissioner Rewa has not
taken into account various inquiries report which
come on record. That being so the matter is
remanded back to the Commissioner, Rewa with
the following directions:-
</p><p id="p_8">   1. The order Annexure P/7 dated 11/06/2012
      shall be kept in abeyance and on petitioner
      filing certified copy of this order along with
      relevant objections and documents before
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  W.P. No. 9038/2012.               4</span>


      (Vikash Kumar Shukla Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh &amp; othrs.)



            the Commissioner, Rewa, he shall look into
            the matter afresh, if it is found by the
            Commissioner, Rewa, based on documents
            that a detailed inquiry is to be conducted,
            he may do so however, if on being satisfied
            about the exoneration of the petitioner in
            the earlier inquiry, he shall be free to
            record his reasons for the same and pass
            appropriate orders in the matter.
</p><p id="p_9">         2. The Commissioner shall take into account
            all   the    three    inquiry    reports   afresh   in
            accordance with law before arriving at a
            conclusion..
</p><p id="p_10">         3. A speaking order after such consideration
            shall be passed within a period of two
            months from the date of filing certified copy
            of this order.
</p><p id="p_11">         4. It is made clear that this Court has not
            expressed any opinion on merits of the
            claim.
</p><p id="p_12">                  With     the     aforesaid     direction,   writ
      petition is disposed of accordingly.
