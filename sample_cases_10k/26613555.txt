                           THOMAS P. JOSEPH, J.

                          O.P.(C) No. 204 OF 2013
                   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

               Dated this the 17th day of January, 2013

                                J U D G M E N T
</pre>


<p id="p_1">       Since the learned counsel for the petitioner/plaintiff submitted that

respondents 1 and 2 are sailing with the petitioner, notice is not issued to

them. Respondents 3 to 6/defendants 3 to 6 who contest the case appear

through counsel.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       2.    Ext.P10, order dated 02.01.2013 in O.S.No.209 of 2010 of the

Second Additional Sub Court, Thrissur is under challenge in this original

petition at the instance of petitioner/plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_3">       3.    Plaintiff filed the suit claiming right over the property as per an

unregistered Will dated 06.11.1992 allegedly executed by the late Thressia.

Petitioner prayed for a declaration that Will dated 14.06.2005, also (said to

be) executed by the said Thressia is not binding on the petitioner or the suit

property and prayed for partition.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       4.    Respondents 3 to 6 denied execution of the Will dated

06.11.1992 and relied upon Will dated 14.06.2005.

</p><p id="p_5">       5.    Petitioner    filed  application     in   the    trial court to direct

respondents 3 to 6 to produce original of the Will dated 06.11.1992, a

photocopy of which she had produced in the trial court. Respondents 3 to 6

replied that they are not in possession of original of the said Will (apart from

their contending that no such Will was duly executed).

O.P.(C).No.204 of 2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      -2-</span>



</p><p id="p_6">      6.     In the proof affidavit of the petitioner, she wanted the

photocopy of the Will dated 06.11.1992 to be marked in evidence. The trial

court refused and passed Ext. P10 order.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      7.     Learned counsel for petitioner submits that Ext.P10, order is

wrong in that petitioner had laid the foundation for adducing secondary

evidence as required under Secs. 65(a) and 66 of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1">Evidence Act</a> (for short

'the Act') and that in the said circumstances, it was open to the petitioner to

prove photocopy of the Will dated 06.11.1992 in accordance with Sec. 68 of

the said Act. Learned counsel has placed reliance on the decision in Rajesh

Kumar Bhati v. Additional District Judge, Jodhpur &amp; Ors.

[AIR 2009 RAJASTHAN 137].
</p>
<p id="p_8">      8.     In response it is contended by the learned counsel for

respondents 3 to 6 that photocopy of the Will dated 06.11.1992 (allegedly

executed by the late Thressia) cannot be exhibited in evidence since it does

not insure accuracy of the copy. It is also contended that since the dispute is

concerning due execution and attestation of the Will, original alone can be

marked in evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      9.     I am unable to accept the latter part of the contention raised by

the learned counsel for respondents 3 to 6.           There may be various

contingencies were original of the Will is not available in which case parties

relying on the Will may have to be permitted to adduce secondary evidence,

of course after complying with the requirements of Sec. 65 of the Act and in

the manner provided under Sec. 68 of the said Act.

O.P.(C).No.204 of 2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        -3-</span>



</p><p id="p_10">       10.   Certainly the photocopy of the Will could not be marked through

the petitioner/PW1 since she is not an attester to that Will. The Will can be

proved only in the manner prescribed by Secs. 68, 69 or 71 of the Act.

Therefore photocopy of the disputed Will could not be marked through PW1.

</p><p id="p_11">       11.   But, that does not mean that photocopy of the Will could not be

marked in evidence provided that petitioner has laid the foundation for

adducing secondary evidence as provided under <a href="/doc/487818/" id="a_2">Section 65</a> of the Act and

further that petitioner is able to insure accuracy of photocopy of the Will.

That is the view taken in the decision referred supra. Therefore, petitioner

has to be permitted to prove photocopy of the disputed Will dated

06.11.1992 in the manner above stated. At the same time, I make it clear

that if disputed, it is for the petitioner to adduce appropriate evidence to

insure accuracy of the photocopy.
</p>
<p id="p_12">       In the light of the above, Ext. P10 order to the extent stated above

cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_13">       Resultantly, the Original Petition is allowed as under.

       Ext.P10 order is set aside to the extent stated hereunder:

</p><p id="p_14">       1.    It is open to the petitioner to exhibit in evidence and

       prove the photocopy of the Will dated 06.11.1992 in the

       manner provided under Secs. 68, 69 or 71 of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_3">Evidence

       Act</a> and as circumstances warranted.
</p>
<p id="p_15">       2.    Petitioner, before attempting to adduce secondary

       evidence of the disputed Will has to comply with Sections 65

O.P.(C).No.204 of 2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    -4-</span>



</p><p id="p_16">      (a) and 66 of the said Act.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      3.    Petitioner, by adducing appropriate evidence as

      circumstances    warranted,  has  to  insure  accuracy of

      photocopy of the disputed Will.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      4.    The acceptability and the probative value of the

      document shall be considered while deciding the suit.




</p><p id="p_19">                                                      Sd/-
