                    Mr. Syed Nurul Arefin,
                    Mr. Rahul Singh,
                    Ms. Udita Ghosh.
                               ....for the petitioner.

                    Mr. Arijit Dey.
                                 .....for the K.M.C.


                    This is an application under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the

              Constitution of India against the alleged creation of

              structures made by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation

              on the property of the writ petitioner.

                    It is the case of the writ petitioner that the Kolkata

              Municipal Corporation had come to the premises of the

              writ petitioner and informed him that they wanted to

              clean the water pond (in his premises) for better health

              and hygiene purposes. Subsequent to the same, the

              petitioner     alleges   that      the   Kolkata        Municipal

              Corporation has illegally constructed some structures

              including fencing and sitting platforms around the pond

              without      the   consent   and   permission      of   the   writ

              petitioner or any of the other co-sharers.
                           2


      On 14th December, 2017 this Court had directed

the Kolkata Municipal Corporation to file a detailed

report on the action taken by the Kolkata Municipal

Corporation on the following points as mentioned

below :-

      a)    The   various      actions     taken    by   the

            Corporation       with   reference      to   the

            schedule property;

      b)    Whether the Corporation had taken any

            permission      from     the    owner    before

            carrying out the above activities on the

            schedule property;

      c)    Whether any order was passed by the

            Corporation for carrying out the various

            activities;

      d)    All documents/orders in relation to the

            above activities;

      Today a one page document has been handed over

to this Court by the counsel appearing on behalf of the

Kolkata Municipal Corporation which states as follows: -

      " Regarding the above W.P., this is to report

that the Parks &amp; Square Department of the Kolkata

Municipal Corporation did not execute any work at
                               3


the above mentioned location and also there is no

future   program     for     construction       at     the   above

mentioned premises".

      The above document does not in any manner

qualify as a report that had been sought by this Court

as specific questions had been put to be answered in the

report. The kind of perfunctory report filed in Court

today is absolutely disapproved and counsel appearing

on behalf of the Corporation should take steps to ensure

that the same is not done in future.

      Be that as it may, the report clearly states that

the Parks and Square Department of the Kolkata

Municipal Corporation has not executed any works on

the above mentioned location and also that they have no

future   programme     for    construction      on     the   above

premises.

      The   stand   taken         by   the   Kolkata    Municipal

Corporation is quite bizarre as on earlier occasions

when the matter was heard by this Court contrary

statements had been made by the counsel appearing on

behalf of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation.

      In any event, the position that we have arrived at

today, based on the report filed by the Corporation, is
                           4


that they have neither carried out any construction nor

do they intend to carry out any construction in the

premises.

      Accordingly, the writ petitioner is allowed to

demolish the said constructions that have been allegedly

carried out by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation.

      The writ petitioner shall inform the respondent</pre>

<p id="p_1">no.4 as to when he shall carry out the demolition work

and the respondent no.4 is directed to deploy police

personnel to assist the writ petitioner at the time of

demolition.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      With the above directions, this writ petition is

disposed of without any order as to costs.

</p><p id="p_3">      Urgent photostat certified copy of this order shall

be given to the parties upon compliance of usual

formalities.
</p>
