</p> 
<p id="p_3">As per version of the F.I.R. marriage of the applicant had taken place with the deceased in the year 2012. It is alleged that as additional dowry there was a demand of one motorcycle and due to non fulfillment of the said demand, deceased was tortured. It is further alleged that information was received by the complainant regarding the death through neighbour that the deceased was killed and her body was concealed somewhere. When the complainant and family members went to in-laws place of the deceased, then they had seen that the house was locked. A doubt was created that the deceased was killed and the body was concealed. 
</p> 
<p id="p_4">On the basis of the information, investigation proceeded. It is submitted by learned counsel for the applicant that infact deceased was not living at his house. She was at her father's place because a case of divorce was pending between the parties. On the date of occurrence, deceased had consumed some poison and parents of the deceased with the help of some unknown persons carried her by jeep and left her at the house of the applicant. Then she was taken to P.H.C. Kadipur, Sultanpur for treatment from where she was taken for further treatment and when she was taken to District Hospital, Sultanpur deceased died. As per post mortem report, contusion 0.5 X 0.5 C.M. was found right side neck, 9 C.M. below the right ear but cause of death was not ascertained and Viscera was preserved. As per Viscera report Aluminum Phosphide was found. Learned counsel for the applicant has failed to explain the injury sustained by her on her neck. He has also failed to place on record any document to show that she was taken to District Hospital, Sultanpur for treatment. Applicant is husband and allegation of demand of dowry are there. 
</p> 
<p id="p_5">Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, I do not find it to be a fit case for granting bail. Accordingly, the bail application is hereby rejected.
