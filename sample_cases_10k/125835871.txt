ORAL ORDER</pre>
 


 


 


<p id="p_1">	Challenge
in this appeal
from order
is order dated 5.11.2012 passed by learned 12th
Additional Senior Civil Judge and Additional C.J.M., Surat below
Exh.5 application in Special Civil Suit No.84 of 2011, whereby the
learned
trial Judge
was pleased to reject application Exh.5 for interim relief filed by
the present appellant   original plaintiff.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_2">	Since
order passed in Civil Application No.962 of 2013 has been complied
with, learned advocate appearing for the respective parties submits
that parties to the suit may be directed to maintain status quo
position qua the suit property, but at the same time, learned
trial Judge
may be directed to expedite the hearing of the suit, so that lis
between the parties can be resolved at an early point of time. 
Considering the facts of the case and issue involved in the matter,
the
learned trial Judge is directed to decide and dispose of the suit on
merit and in accordance with law as early as possible but not later
than one year from the date of receipt
of the order of this Court.  Both the parties to the proceedings are
hereby directed to cooperate with the learned trial Judge and shall
not seek unnecessary adjournment.  The learned
trial Judge
is directed to deposit the amount in cumulative FDR initially for a
period of one year in the name of the present appellant   original
plaintiff
and original FDR shall be kept with the Registry of the Court.  It is
also clarified that if the suit is not disposed of within stipulated
time, then the learned
trial Judge
shall renew the FDR for appropriate period.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_3">	While
parting with the order, it is clarified that this Court has examined
the impugned order passed by the learned trial Judge within the
limited scope of provisions of Order 43 Rule 1(r) of the Code,
whereas the main controversy involved in the suit is at large before
the trial Court to be adjudicated through full-fledge trial. 
Therefore, the learned trial Judge shall not be influenced by any
observations recorded in the impugned order and observations recorded
by this Court herein above while deciding the suit at the end of
trial.  The findings recorded either by the trial Court or by this
Court at inter locutory stage of the suit are tentative in its nature
and the learned trial Judge shall decide the case on its merit and as
per evidence that may be led during the course of trial and decide
the suit in accordance with law. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_4">	With
the aforesaid observations and directions, the appeal from order
stands disposed of.  Direct service is permitted.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_5">	In
view of disposal of appeal from order, civil application does not
survive and the same stands disposed of accordingly.
</p>
