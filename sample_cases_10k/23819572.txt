passed.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioners that the

award passed by the Labour Court is contrary to the Circulars

issued by the petitioners, whereby, in case anyone is required to

work on weekly holidays, he can avail compensatory leave within

three days and is not entitled to any payment for the days he

worked on holidays and, therefore, the award passed by the

Labour Court being contrary to the said provisions, the petition

deserves to be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_14">     On 01.04.2019 time was granted to the petitioners to

ascertain as to whether the workman was accorded compensatory

leave qua 167 days he had worked on weekly holidays.

submissions that the petitioners are not in possession of any

material in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_16">     A perusal of the order passed by the Labour Court indicates

that from the record produced before it, it was established that

the workman had worked for 167 days on weekly holidays. Once

the said aspect was established, the workman was entitled for

payment for the days he had worked on weekly holidays. As the

petitioners have failed to establish that the workman was given
