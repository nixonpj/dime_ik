Brief reasons for the decision of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.                       It is in allegation against accused that on 06.08.02 at 

about 08:05 p.m. near the Liquor Vend, Service Road, Trilokpuri, he was 

apprehended by PW1(HC Amar Chand) &amp; PW2(Ct. Bhagat Singh) with a 

buttondar   knife   in   contravention   of   the   notification   of   the   Delhi 

Government. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.                       The charge was framed against the accused U/s 25 of 

<a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_3">Arms Act</a> by the Ld. Predecessor on 26.10.05. The accused pleaded not 

guilty and claimed trial.   
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.                       The   prosecution   has   examined   the   aforesaid 

witnesses alongwith the IO(PW3). The accused did not lead any evidence 

in defence. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.                       The   Ld.   APP   has   prayed   for   conviction   on   the 

testimony of PW1 &amp; PW2 to the effect that as they were  on patrolling 

duty in the area of Motherdairy, Trilok Puri on 06.08.02 at about 07:45 

p.m., they received a secret information that a boy was present near the 

liquor vend with the intention to commit an offence.  A raiding party was 

formed.     The  accused   was     apprehended  at   the  instance  of   the  secret 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">FIR No. 320/02, PS Trilok Puri                                         Page No. 2 of 5</span>
 informer. The search of his trousers yielded a buttondar knife.  The knife 

was seized vide memo Ex. PW1/B whereas the sketch of the same was 

prepared and exhibited as Ex. PW1/A. The FIR was registered on the 

rukka   Ex.   PW1/C   prepared   by   PW1.     The   IO(HC   Bhim   Singh足PW3) 

reached the spot and was presented with the accused.  The accused came 

to be arrested vide arrest memo Ex. PW1/F and his personal search was 

recorded vide memo Ex. PW1/G. It was argued by the Ld. Prosecutor that 

all witnesses had identified the accused and verified his arrest alongwith 

recovery of knife.  Further, that the knife had been identified as Ex. P1.

</p><p id="p_6">5.                        The counsel for the accused instead argued that the 

purported recovery is concocted.   It was submitted by the Ld. Defence 

Counsel   that   no   public   witness   was   incorporated   in   the   investigation 

despite availability.  
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.                        The   court   has   considered   the   allegations   reflected 

from the evidence of PW1 &amp; PW2. It would be appropriate to observe 

that the allegations are highly stereo typed in nature where policemen on 

patrolling duty receive a secret information regarding the presence of a 

person with a weapon at a particular spot and the said   person is then 

apprehended with a knife.  As is the case in most such matters, no effort 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FIR No. 320/02, PS Trilok Puri                                            Page No. 3 of 5</span>
 was made by the police officials to join public persons.  It is notable that 

various persons were present at the spot as PW1, PW2 &amp; PW3 admitted 

the presence of public persons.  Even otherwise, being  in the vicinity of 

a Mother dairy outlet and the time of incident being around 07:45 p.m., 

the presence of passersby was only to be expected.  It would have been 

appropriate for the IO to record the statements of some of these persons. 

However, the police witnesses provided the routine explanation inter足alia 

that public persons were asked to join proceedings but none agreed.  This 

explanation is not credible as no written notice was served upon the said 

persons to at least verify their identity. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.                       The court also concurs with the submission of the 

Ld. Defence Counsel inter足alia that the FIR number and other particulars 

find mention on the seizure memo and sketch of the knife, though the 

same were prepared before the actual registration of the FIR.   PW1 &amp; 

PW2   had   deposed   that   PW1   dispatched  the   rukka  after  preparing  the 

seizure memo and the sketch of the knife.  Yet, the particulars of the FIR 

found  mention  on  the seizure memo and the sketch of  the knife. The 

possibility of manipulation of documents and hence false implication of 

the accused cannot be ruled out.  
</p>
<p id="p_9">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FIR No. 320/02, PS Trilok Puri                                      Page No. 4 of 5</span>
</p><p id="p_10"> 8.                       The inception of the case itself remained in doubt. 

The allegations are based on highly cryptic information received from an 

unnamed secret informer.  It was not brought forth in evidence as to what 

was   the   information   received   regarding   the   purported   motive   of   the 

accused in supposedly reaching the spot armed with a knife.  The secret 

informer   was   not   examined   in   evidence   and   the   prosecution   version 

seems absolutely convenient to the IO and other police officials.  It is as 

if the accused readily planted himself into a trap and got caught with a 

knife.   Again  the  failure to join public witnesses must be seen in the 

context of the above infirmity.  
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.                       The accused is granted the benefit of doubt and is 

acquitted.
