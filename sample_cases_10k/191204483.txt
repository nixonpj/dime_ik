seeking his release on bail in Crime No.134/2018 of

<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.    I have heard the learned counsel for the

petitioner and the learned High Court Government

Pleader for respondent-State.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">     3.    The brief facts of the case are that:

     The complainant is second wife of the deceased.

She got married with the deceased about ten years ago.

The deceased had several cases in Banasavadi police
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                           -3-</span>




station and he had gone to jail on several occasions.

Subsequently, he was released on bail about one year

back.   About three weeks prior to the incident, there

was     a   quarrel   between     the   deceased     and

accused No.1 - Nagaraja. It is alleged that her husband

had assaulted accused No.1. Because of the said act,

accused No.1 and his associates were grinding axe

against the deceased. Accused No.13 was a friend of

accused No.1. The deceased and accused No.1 were

living in a room in Kolar. The complainant visited the

room of her husband in Kolar to meet him. On

17.05.2018 at about 5.00 p.m., the deceased told to

complainant that he is going to see his children from his

first wife and accordingly he went along with accused

No.13 and one Abhi in a car. At 11.40 p.m., she received

a telephone call stating that her husband was murdered

near petrol bunk. She immediately rushed to the scene

of occurrence and reached there at 2.30 a.m. There she

saw the dead body of her husband and several injuries
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             -4-</span>




on his face, abdomen, legs and hands. When she asked

Abhi, who had accompanied the deceased in a car, she

came to know that they were going from Rayasandra

towards Kodathi Gate and when they reached Kodathi

Gate, accused Nos.1, 3, 4 and 5 came in a Scorpio car

and obstructed the car and accused No.13 and other

accused on account of previous enmity assaulted him

with longs, choppers and knives etc., and committed

murder of the deceased. On the basis of which, a case

has been registered and charge sheet has also been

filed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">         4.   It is the submission of the learned counsel

for petitioner - accused No.5 that already charge sheet

has been filed and CWs-2 to 4 are eye witnesses to the

alleged incident. But they have not specifically stated

that the petitioner - accused No.5 was present at the

spot. He has also submitted that they have stated

omnibus       statement   that    accused   persons   have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              -5-</span>




assaulted.    Even   description      of   the    accused    who

assaulted    whom    has    also    not    been    stated.   Test

identification   parade    has     also    not   been   held   in

accordance with law. It has to be held in police station.

He further submitted that one Arun was also along with

deceased and he has been left out from the charge

sheet. He further submitted that the main witness was

one Abhi, who accompanied the deceased in a car, and

his statement has not been recorded and no other overt

act has been held in this behalf. He further submitted

that petitioner - accused No.5 is no way concerned to

the alleged crime. He is ready to abide conditions

imposed by this Court and ready to offer surety.               On

these grounds, he prays to allow the petition and to

release petitioner-accused No.5 on bail.


</p><p id="p_8">      5.     Per contra, learned High Court Government

Pleader vehemently argued and submitted that there is

extra judicial confession made by the accused to one
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                          -6-</span>




Bramhachari and Yogesh, wherein that he clearly stated

that they have purchased lethal weapons and have

assaulted the deceased. He further submitted that

petitioner - accused No.5 has assaulted with iron long

and caused grievous injuries to his chest and other

parts of the body. Even Post Mortem report clearly

indicates that the deceased has sustained grievous

injuries and succumbed to the said injuries. He

submitted that there are three eye witnesses to the

alleged incident. If the petitioner-accused No.5 is

enlarged on bail, he may abscond and may not be

available for trial. On these grounds, he prays to

dismiss the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">     6.    I have carefully and cautiously gone through

the contents of the complaint and other materials,

which has been produced along with the petition.


</p><p id="p_11">     7.    As could be seen from the contents of the

complaint and statement of eye witnesses i.e., CWs-2 to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                -7-</span>




4, they stated that they have witnessed the alleged

incident. But they have not specifically stated that who

assaulted with which weapon on which part of the body

of the deceased and they have also not stated the

specific role of the petitioner-accused No.5 in the

alleged    incident.    One   Abhi     has   accompanied       the

deceased     and       he   stated    that   accused      persons

intercepted the car and thereafter, they assaulted the

deceased. But in the charge sheet materials, he has not

been mentioned as a witness and his statement has not

been recorded. That witness is considered to be a

material    and    fatal    witness    to    the   case   of   the

prosecution. If his statement is not before the Court

below, then under such circumstances, statements of

CWs-2 to 4 is also not going to help the case of the

prosecution in any manner. This Court is conscious of

the fact that brutal murder has taken place but without

there being any cogent and acceptable evidence it

cannot be said that it is the accused who has caused
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            -8-</span>




death of the deceased. Though in the charge sheet

papers it disclose that the said Abhi who accompanied

the deceased in the car could not be traced after the

incident, even till filing of the charge sheet, it is not a

ground to give an excuse to Investigating Agency and

during the said period, if he has not been traced and his

statement has not been recorded, then under such

circumstances, the benefit of doubt should be given to

the accused. Under such circumstance, there is no

specific overt-acts alleged against petitioner-accused

No.5. That too, already when the charge sheet is filed, I

feel that by imposing some stringent conditions, if the

accused petitioner is ordered to be released on bail, it is

going to meet the ends of justice.        In the light of

discussions held by me above, petition is allowed.

in Crime No.134/2018 of Varthur Police Station for the

offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1096965/" id="a_12">Sections 143</a>, <a href="/doc/1196530/" id="a_13">144</a>, <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_14">147</a>, <a href="/doc/763672/" id="a_15">148</a>,
