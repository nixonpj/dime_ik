                   --------------------------------------
                    Crl.R.P. No.1429 OF 2011
                      --------------------------------
               Dated this the 5th day of July 2011

                                 ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">             The Revision is directed against the conviction and

sentence of the petitioner for the offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_1">Section 138</a> of the

Negotiable Instruments Act (for short, <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_2">NI Act</a>).               The trial

Magistrate, on finding him guilty of the offence, convicted and

sentenced him to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of

four months and to pay a fine of Rs.55,000/- with default term of

imprisonment of three months.             In the appeal, the learned

Sessions Judge confirmed the conviction, modifying the sentence

till the rising of the Court with liability to pay compensation of

Rs.55,000/-    and    in   default     thereof     to   undergo simple

imprisonment for three months. Feeling aggrieved against the

conviction rendered, concurrently, with the modification as

aforesaid in the sentence by the learned Sessions Judge, the

revision has been filed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.   At the time of hearing, the learned counsel for the

revision petitioner fairly submitted that the defence canvassed as

to the denial of execution of cheque and also the transaction

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Crl.R.P.No.1429/2011             2</span>

thereto, had not been substantiated by any worthmentioning

evidence, and urged that reasonable time may be afforded to

settle the claim of the complainant arising under the cheque, and

thus to avoid incarceration imposed under the sentence passed

by the Court below. The learned counsel further submits that a

nonbailable warrant issued is now pending execution against the

petitioner in view of the nonpayment of the compensation within

the time and failure to appear before the Court as directed under

the judgment of the lower appellate court. The complaint is seen

lodged as early in 2005 and the cheque amount is shown to be

Rs.55,000/-.     On the face of the time lag as indicated above,

prima facie, the petitioner may not be entitled to any indulgence

from this Court.     However, having regard to the submissions

made by the learned counsel for the petitioner to show

indulgence, it is ordered that the Judicial First Class Magistrate

Court-VII, Thiruvananthapuram, which is now taking coercive

steps against the petitioner, shall keep in abeyance the execution

of the warrant ordered for a period of one month from today to

enable the petitioner to pay the amount ordered as compensation

and to appear before that Court on 06-08-2011 to serve out the

sentence of imprisonment for one day. In default of appearance

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl.R.P.No.1429/2011            3</span>

and also failure to pay the compensation awarded, the Magistrate

shall take appropriate steps for executing the warrant ordered

against the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      Subject to the above observations, the Revision is disposed

of.
