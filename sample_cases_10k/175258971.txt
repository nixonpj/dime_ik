                              Date : 05/12/2014

                                 ORAL ORDER</pre>


<p id="p_1">1.          Heard          learned    advocates       appearing      for   the
parties. The petitioner-employer has approached this Court
by way of this petition, challenging the award and order
dated   09.12.2013,          passed     by     the   Industrial      Tribunal,
Bhavnagar, in Reference (IT) No.42 of 1995, on the ground
that the Court ought not to have ordered regularization of
the workman, despite the fact that the workman had never
been worked regularly.
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.          Learned advocate appearing for the petitioner
employer    submitted         that     on      account   of   long     pending
litigations, the workman was continued in service. That
continuation cannot be held out to be long continuation of
service so as to make the workman eligible for permanent
absorption, as ordered by the Tribunal. Learned counsel
relying upon decision of Apex Court in case of State of
Rajasthan And Others Vs. Daya Lal And Others, reported in
(2011) 2 Supreme Court Cases 429, submitted that the long


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     Page 1 of 7</span>
           C/SCA/2264/2014                                                 ORDER




drown litigation and the time spent therein cannot be of
any avail to the workman for seeking permanency on the
basis of long employment.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.            Learned advocate appearing for the petitioner
employer further submitted that the matter has a chequered
history, as the workman was employed as a dailywager and
when his services were put an end, he raised industrial
disputes in which vide order dated 17.08.1991, he was
ordered    to      be       reinstated       on      the    same      post.       Pursuant
thereto,      the       workman's        reinstatement             was      made       as    a
dailywager and since then he was working as such. The
industrial         dispute       was      raised           seeking       benefits            of
regularization           and     other        benefits          available         to        the
permanent       employees.            This        reference        was      marked           as
Reference (IT) No.42 of 1995, wherein the Court rendered
decision      on        17.04.2004,          in      which      the      benefits            of
permanency       were        ordered.        This     order      of      Tribunal           was
assailed in S.C.A. No.8794 of 2004, in which this Court
vide order dated 22.07.2004 passed an interim order under
which the petitioners were directed to pay the wages based
upon the minimum scale of the post of Peon and accordingly
the    petition      had       been    thereafter           taken      up    for       final
hearing vide order dated 07.02.2013. This Court relying
upon    the      full        Bench      decision           in    case       of     Amreli
Municipality        Vs.        Gujarat       Pradesh         Municipal           Employees
Union, reported in 2004 (2) GLH 692, relegated the matter
for fresh consideration to the Tribunal and thereafter the
Tribunal rendered its decision on 09.12.2013, holding that
the    workman      was        entitled       to      be     treated        as     regular
employee, however, the wages and benefits in actual order



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       Page 2 of 7</span>
        C/SCA/2264/2014                                              ORDER




to be paid only from 2004 and earlier period was ordered
to be treated as notional to be used only for fixing pay
and wages etc.
            Thus, it was argued that these many years gone
into litigation, could not have been treated as long drown
service, which had been wrongly treated as entitling the
workman for seeking benefit of permanency.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.          Learned       advocate           appearing        for   the     workman
contended that the opportunity availed twice namely during
the course of the hearing of the Reference, which resulted
into the order passed in the year 2004, and after remand
in the year 2013, the employer did not show as to how and
in what manner the employment of the workman could be
treated as irregular or a back-door entry. The claim of
non observance of formality of recruitment would be of no
avail, as the workman was in fact engaged way back in the
year 1981, to be more precise on 07.08.1981, and he was
continued   till     1986,       when      his      illegal    termination      was
brought about. This termination of 11.09.1986 was illegal
and as such it was set aside by the court's order dated
17.08.1991 and he was reinstated and thereafter raised
industrial dispute for seeking benefits.
</p>

<p id="p_5">5.          Learned           advocate       for      the     workman       further
contended    that        in    absence        of     any    recruitment      rules
pleaded, there could not have been any pleadings qua so
called irregularities in employment.</p><pre id="pre_2">


6.          This    Court        is     of     the    considered      view     that
looking to the           rival contentions raised at the bar and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      Page 3 of 7</span>
           C/SCA/2264/2014                                                ORDER




</pre><p id="p_6">looking to the decision impugned in this petition, the
matter     requires           detail      considerations.              Hence,     Rule.
Expedited.
</p>

<p id="p_7">7.           The question of interim relief is required to be
considered, at this stage, as there are rival submissions
in and against the interim relief, which has been prayed
for. The Court is of the considered view that the balance
of convenience is required to be struck and, therefore,
the peculiar facts of the case needs to be considered. In
the instant case, the following facts indicate that they
are indisputable namely;
</p>

<p id="p_8">(i)          The workman was engaged in the year 1981, to be
more precise on 07.08.1981, since then he was continuously
serving      till           11.09.1986,         when      his       services      were
terminated.        Now,        this      period,         if     one      takes    into
consideration, then one can safely conclude that there was
no aspect of any regular or irregular employment. The
relevant     recruitment         rules,        which     were     prevalent,      were
also that of year 1985 only. Till date i.e. in the year
2014,     the    employer        petitioner            has    not      produced       any
recruitment       rules,        which     could        have     been     said    to    be
prevalent in the year 1981, on which year the workman came
to be employed or engaged for the first time.
</p>

<p id="p_9">(ii) The close perusal of the written statement indicate
that there exists no specific contention supported by any
documentary       evidences       qua      the        existence     of    recruitment
rules and supporting pleadings qua its non observance for
engaging the workman.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                        Page 4 of 7</span>
<pre id="pre_3">           C/SCA/2264/2014                                               ORDER




(iii)         The employer petitioner got opportunity twice,
as    submitted       by     learned       advocate       for     the     respondent
</pre><p id="p_10">workman, as after the filing of written statement and
before    the     order      was     rendered       in    the    year     2004.        The
opportunity to place on record the material was available,
which appears not to have been availed of and after the
matter was remanded in the year 2013 till the award was
rendered, which is impugned in this petition being second
opportunity,        which     also       has    not      been    availed        of     for
justifying its stand of so called irregular employment.
</p>

<p id="p_11">(iv) As against this, one needs to look into the aspect of
industrial dispute right and its provision, as the factum
of employment, is not denied. The factum of the workman
put in service is not denied. The fact that there are no
prohibitory       orders       in    the       interregnum        period        is     not
denied. When these facts are taken into consideration in
line, then one will have to accept the fact that the
workman was entitled to the fair treatment at the hands of
the   State     authorities          and    the     instrumentality             of     the
State.      The       workman's          initial         dispute        after          his
reinstatement in the year 1991 was also for seeking fair
treatment and grievances qua unfair labour practice, as
despite    there      being       work     available,       he    was     not        being
treated as a permanent hand for the reasons best known to
the authorities. In that light, when the pleadings and
evidences     are     examined,       one      will      have    to   come      to    the
conclusion       that       the     workman      would      surely      entitle        to
receive     better          treatment       than      the       treatment        of      a
dailywager.
</p>

               These are, of course, prima facie observations
and   shall     not       be     governing       the        final       outcome        of    the
matter, as they are made with a view to examine the aspect
of granting of interim relief only.
</p>

<p id="p_13">8.      In light thereof, this Court is of the view that by
way of interim arrangement, without binding both the sides
to seek their appropriate relief at the time of final
disposal of the matter based upon their arguments, the
workman is ordered to be treated as if he is entitled to
receive       all    the       benefits      flowing         from       the     Government
Resolution      dated       17.10.1988,          whereunder             also    a     special
scheme is carved out for giving treatment to the daily
rated employees and this treatment and the benefits based
thereupon, if ordered, it will not prejudice anyone.                                         The
Court hasten to add here that this granting of relief of
staying of the award is on the condition that the employer
shall    treat       the       workman     and         grant      him    all     the        wage
benefits,      as    if     he    is    given      the       benefit      flowing           from
Government Resolution dated 17.10.1988. It would not be
prejudiced      in    any        manner     the        workman's         right        to    seek
appropriate relief or to defend the award and seek the
entire benefit of the award as a permanent employee, nor
would    it    prejudice         the     right         of   the     employer          to    seek
appropriate relief at the time of final hearing. In short
the interim relief granted, is without prejudice to rights
and contentions of both the sides.</p><pre id="pre_4">




9.             Hence,       by    way     of     interim          relief,       the        award
