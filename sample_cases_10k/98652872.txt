<p id="p_1">              1       By way of present appeal, an order dated 22.09.2011 passed
              by Principal Magistrate JJB-1 in case FIR 301/11 P.S. Tilak Nagar
              has been challenged. Vide the impugned order Principal Magistrate
              JJB-1 was pleased to dismiss bail application filed on behalf of
              Juvenile Jatin.
</p>

<p id="p_2">              2       After appeal was assigned to this court, trial court record was
              summoned and thereafter arguments advanced were heard.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Criminal Appeal No. 39/11                                                                   Page 1 of 4</span>
                                                                                                 

<p id="p_3">              3       During course of his submission, Ld. Counsel for appellant
              has placed reliance on judicial pronouncements, "24 (1983) DLT
              65 titled Arjun Vs. The State; Crl.M(M) No. 2898 of 1993,
              titled Navin Panwar Vs. State; and 117 (2005) DLT 5, titled
              T.Gurudeo Vs. State" and had submitted that juvenile involved in
              murder case have been ordered to be released on bail on number of
              occasions. It was further submitted by Ld. Counsel that even the
              present appellant has been falsely implicated in the present murder
              case despite being innocent and that even as per allegation, he was
              not the main assailant. It was submitted by Ld. Counsel that there
              was no previous criminal history of the present appellant and had
              he no earlier criminal antecedents. As per Ld. Counsel, mother of
              appellant had left him in his childhood and his father expired about
              four years back. It was claimed that appellant was residing with his
              Bua and Chacha and sometime used to help his Chacha in his scrap
              business. Ld. Counsel further submitted that as appellant has clean
              antecedents, keeping him in company of other juveniles in the
              remand home may lead to bad influence upon the appellant. It was
              submitted that Social Information Report filed before Ld. Trial
              Court had clearly mentioned that family of Bua and Chacha of
              appellant had religious inclination and on basis thereof, it was
              submitted that they would be fit and proper persons to take care of
              the juvenile. It was prayed that as appellant has now been in
              custody since 13.09.2011, he be ordered to be released on bail.
</p>

<p id="p_4">              4       Ld. Addl. PP for State on the other hand has drawn attention
              of this court towards the impugned order and also the S.I.R filed in
              this case. While drawing attention of this court to S.I.R, it was
              submitted that as per report of Probationary Officer, the juvenile had
              habit of smoking and sometime took beer and ganja.            It was
              submitted that as per the impugned order, the appellant had been

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Criminal Appeal No. 39/11                                                                 Page 2 of 4</span>
                                                                                               

              advised de-addiction treatment for about 90 days. Ld. Addl. PP for
              State submitted that releasing the appellant on bail at this stage
              would mean that de-addiction treatment would have to be foregone
              and this would be to the determent of the juvenile. It was further
              pointed out that as per S.I.R and the impugned order, the Bua had
              specifically claimed that she had not informed her husband about
              this case and used to come to JJB without informing her husband. It
              was submitted that the alleged Chacha of juvenile never came
              forward during course of proceeding. On basis thereof, it was
              submitted that releasing the juvenile on bail in this case would be
              detrimental to his interest. Accordingly, it was prayed that appeal
              be dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_5">              5       This court has given thoughtful consideration to arguments
              advanced and has also perused the trial court record including the
              S.I.R. Perusal of the bail petition filed before Ld. Trial Court and
              the present appeal reveals that none has claimed responsibility to
              take care of welfare of the juvenile. The Bua who is present during
              course of hearing of appeal and who as per record had joined
              proceeding before JJB, has never come forward with an undertaking
              before the Ld. Trial Court to take care of the juvenile or to accept
              responsibility of his treatment or upkeep. A perusal of S.I.R goes to
              show that Bua had admitted that she used to visit JJB without
              intimating her husband and as per report, she was hiding facts of the
              present case from her husband. As already mentioned, the alleged
              Chacha has never come forward accepting responsibility of the
              juvenile.
</p>

<p id="p_6">              6       Another factum that appears from record from S.I.R and the
              trial court record is that appellant has been advised de-addiction
              treatment of 90 days. Discontinuing the said treatment midway, in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Criminal Appeal No. 39/11                                                               Page 3 of 4</span>
                                                                                                

              considered opinion of this court, would be detrimental to health and
              development of the juvenile. The S.I.R further mentions that Bua
              is guardian of the juvenile but her parental supervision is weak.
              Factum that Bua used to visit JJB without intimating her husband
              who was unaware about involvement of juvenile in this case also
              speaks volume in itself about future of juvenile in matrimonial
              home of the Bua.
</p>

<p id="p_7">              7       In considered opinion of this court, keeping in view facts and
              circumstances of the case and the facts enumerated herein above,
              releasing the appellant on bail at this stage was likely to expose him
              to moral, physical or psychological danger and his release was
              likely to defeat the ends of justice. Releasing him on bail at this
              stage, as already observed herein above, is likely to adversely affect
              his mental and physical health as his de-addiction treatment is likely
              to be discontinued midway.
</p>

<p id="p_8">              8       In view of peculiar facts and circumstances of the case
              mentioned herein above, the judicial pronouncements relied upon by
              Ld. Counsel for appellant do not come to his rescue.
</p>

<p id="p_9">              9       Keeping in view aforesaid facts and circumstances of the
              case, this court is of considered opinion that it is not fit stage to
              release the appellant on bail.      Accordingly the appeal stands
              dismissed.
