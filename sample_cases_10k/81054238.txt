                         Defendant   by   enabling   him   to   try   to   prove   a  
                         defence." 
</p><p id="p_11">             In the light of the above, I may now consider the submissions of the 

             defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_12">               

</p><p id="p_13">      7. Defendant contended that he has never asked the plaintiff for a 

             friendly   loan   of   Rs.   10   lakh   and   Plaintiff   has   fabricated   the 

             document as he has developed a bad habit of playing Satta on 

             the   initiation   of   plaintiff   and   his   brother   and   at   the   end   of   year 

             2010, he was forced to give signed blank cheque and  a stamp 

             paper to the plaintiff. 
</p>
<p id="p_14">               

</p><p id="p_15">      8. Admittedly, Defendant has not disclosed the name of brother of 

             plaintiff.   Further he has not disclosed from when Plaintiff and his 

             brother initiated him to play Satta.   It is pertinent that defendant 

             has   not   given   the   signed   blank   cheque   and   a   stamp   paper   to 

             discharge the liability of gambling amount. So in view of this, the 

             friendly loan of Rs. 10 lakh is not concerned in any manner with the 

             defendant's bad habit of playing satta.

Suit no. 537/14                                          Sanjeev Thakur  vs Anip Bhaita                                                   6 of 10 
</p><p id="p_17">       9. It is not in dispute that promissory note cum undertaking was typed 

             on judicial stamp paper of Rs. 50/­ which was issued in the name of 

             defendant on 09­12­2010 and further the said stamp paper bears 

             the signature and thumb impression of defendant on its back side, 

             so,   It   is   clear   from   stamp   paper   on   which   promissory   note   cum 

             undertaking   was   written   that   it   was   purchased   by   defendant 

             himself.     It   is   also   pertinent   that   the   promissory   note   cum 

             undertaking was not typed on stamp paper from the type writer 

             but   print   out   of   same  was   taken   from   computer  on   the     stamp 

             paper thereafter, it was signed by defendant.  So in view of this, I 

             am of considered opinion that non­judicial stamp paper of Rs. 50/­ 

             was not blank but the content of promissory cum undertaking was 

             typed when it was signed by the defendant.

<p id="p_18">              

</p><p id="p_19">      10. Further it is not in dispute that cheque bearing no. 435478 bear the 

             signature of defendant.  One of the contention of defendant that 

             the cheque bearing no. 435478 was blank when he was forced to 

             sign   and   give   it   to   the   plaintiff.       Admittedly,   on   the   back   of 

             cheque  bearing   no.   435478,   there   is   endorsement   in   the   hand 

             writing of defendant himself in Hindi Language to the effect that "  

             yeh cheque main udhar chukta karney ke liye de raha hun"  (This cheque is being 

             issued   by   me   for   the   purpose   to   clear   the   borrowed   amount). 

             Further   on   the   back   side   of   cheque   defendant   also   put   his 


Suit no. 537/14                                          Sanjeev Thakur  vs Anip Bhaita                                                   7 of 10 
              signature.       It   is   admitted   that   cheque   bearing   no.   435478   was 

             issued in regard to the principle amount of Rs. 10 Lakh on 01­3­2013. 

             The   cheque   in   question   was   given   by   the   defendant   to   the 

             plaintiff, so in view of this, I am of considered opinion that cheque 

             bearing   no.   435478   was   not   blank,   when   it   was   given   to   the 

             plaintiff. 
</p>
<p id="p_20">              

</p><p id="p_21">      11. Defendant   also   contended   that   he   was   forced   to   sign   blank 

             cheque   and   stamp   paper.     Admittedly,   defendant   has   not 

             disclosed any date and month when he was forced to give signed 

             blank cheque bearing no. 435478 and a stamp paper. Further he 

             has   not   disclosed   who   had   forced   him   to   give   signed   blank 

             cheque and stamp paper to the plaintiff.   It is also pertinent that 

             defendant   has   not   made   any   complaint   regarding   forcibly 

             obtaining   him   a   signed   blank   cheque   and   stamp   paper.     It   is 

             unbelievable   that   a   person   was   forced   to   give   a   signed   blank 

             cheque and stamp paper to hand over some other person but he 

             has not filed any complaint to the police or any other appropriate 

             authority till date. It is also admitted that defendant has not written 

             any letter or served any notice upon plaintiff for return of his signed 

             blank cheque and stamp paper.   So, under these circumstances, I 

             am   of   considered  opinion  that   the   there  is   no   substance  in  the 

             contention of  the defendant   that  he was forced to  give signed 


Suit no. 537/14                                          Sanjeev Thakur  vs Anip Bhaita                                                   8 of 10 
              blank   cheque   bearing   no.   435478   and   a   stamp   paper   to   the 

             plaintiff.

<p id="p_22">

</p><p id="p_23">      12. In view of aforesaid discussion, it is obvious that the defence raised 

             by  the  defendants   is   a   sham   defence   as   no   merit   found   in   the 

             defence   raised   by   the   defendant.     Accordingly,   I   am   of 

             considered  opinion that   granting  leave to  defend would  merely 

             enable   the   defendant   to   prolong   a   litigation   by   raising   frivolous 

             and untenable pleas. There are no plausible grounds stated by the 

             defendant   which   may   be   deemed   sufficient   to   entitle   him   to 

             defend   the   instant   suit   and   therefore   application   of   defendant 

             U/O XXXVII Rule 3(5) CPC is dismissed.
</p>                  
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">      13. In view of above discussion, it is clear that defendant approached 

             plaintiff for friendly loan and plaintiff had given the loan of Rs. 10 

             lakh on   09­12­2010 to the defendant who   executed promissory 

             note   cum   undertaking   on   even   date   to   repay   the   said   loan 

             amount   within   1­1/2   years,   but   defendant   has   not   returned   the 

             said   amount   within   prescribed   period   and   therefore,   he   issued 

             cheque bearing no. 435478 drawn on State Bank of India of Rs. 

             10,00,000/­ dated 01­3­2013 in favour of plaintiff, but this cheque 

             was   dishonoured   on   its   presentation.     Thereafter,   plaintiff   called 

             defendant   to   repay   the   loan   amount   vide   legal   notice   dated 



Suit no. 537/14                                          Sanjeev Thakur  vs Anip Bhaita                                                   9 of 10 
             13­3­2013 but  defendant has not paid any amount to the plaintiff, 

            hence   plaintiff   is   entitle   to   recover   amount   of   Rs.   10   lakh   from 

            defendant.     Accordingly   instant   suit   is   decreed   for  a   sum   of   Rs. 

            10,00,000/­ in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant.



</p><p id="p_26">      14. Defendant was agreed vide promissory note cum undertaking to 

            repay the loan amount  within 1­1/2 years and if he failed to return 

            the   said   amount   within   the   prescribed   period,   he   has   to   pay 

            interest @ 12% P.A.     Admittedly, plaintiff is not doing commercial 

            transaction with defendant, so I am of considered opinion that the 

            rate of interest is exorbitant as no nationalized bank pay so much 

            of interest.   So keeping in view the facts of the case, interest of 

            justice would be met by awarding interest @  8 % per annum from 

            the date of filing of the Suit till recovery. The plaintiff shall also be 

            entitled to costs.
