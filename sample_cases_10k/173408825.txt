</pre><p id="p_1">      Heard Mr. NK Kalita, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. P

Roy, learned counsel for the opposite party.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.    The present petitioner was the defendant in Money Suit No.

140/2006 which was instituted by the sole respondent herein. Plaintiff's

suit was for realisation of Rs. 2,60,000/- from the petitioner defendant.

Defendant appeared and submitted written statement whereafter the

learned Court below framed issues and put the parties to prove their

respective cases. Plaintiff adduced evidence by examining witnesses and

also producing documents. Defendants stopped appearing w.e.f. 02.02.2009

i.e. the date when plaintiff was adducing his evidence and no witness of the

plaintiff was cross-examined by the defendant. After closure of the

plaintiff's evidence, learned Court fixed the case for evidence by

defendant side. But since 02.02.2009 defendant stopped appearing in the

case evidence on her part. At this stage the learned Trial court after

perusal of the evidence led by the plaintiff alone, passed his judgment on

07.08.2009 decreeing the suit for Rs. 2,60,000/- along with interest @ 6%

per annum from the date of institution of the suit till realisation. At this

stage, the defendant appeared before the learned trial court and filed

application under Order IX Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure with

prayer to set aside the decree dated 07.08.2009. The learned trial court

by order dated 22.11.2010 considered the application along with the

application for condoning delay of 359 days and thereupon dismissed the

same holding that the impugned judgment and decree being an inter party

one did not come within the sweep of Order IX Rule 13 of the Code of Civil

Procedure. The learned court did not consider the application for

condonation of delay rather closed the proceeding on the point of

applicability of Order IX Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Aggrieved,

defendant approached this court by Civil Revision Petition being No.

37/2011 and this Court by order dated 02.02.2011 rejected the same



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                               Page 2 of 11</span>
CRP (I/O) 49 of 2014
 holding that revision petition is not maintainable and appeal under Order

XLIII Rule 1 (d) of the Code of Civil Procedure would be the appropriate

remedy. It is thereafter the defendant preferred an appeal under Order

XLIII Rule 1 (d) of the Code of Civil Procedure before the learned

Additional District Judge (FTC) No. 3, Kamrup, Guwahati. The appeal was

numbered as Misc. Appeal No. 08/2013. After hearing the parties, the

learned first appellate court passed judgment on 04.01.2014 holding that

the defendant appeared in the case by filing written statement and

subsequently defaulted to appear and so for all intents and purposes, it was

an inter party judgment and so Order IX Rule 13 of the Code of Civil

Procedure does not have any application in this case. The learned Appellate

court, further, held that as the application under Order IX Rule 13 of the

Code of Civil Procedure itself was not maintainable, there was no question

of allowing the application under <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_1">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act. This

judgment and order dated 04.01.2014 has been challenged in this present

revision petition by the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.    Mr. NK Kalita, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that

defendant initially appeared in the case, filed written statement and

contested the suit but he subsequently defaulted in appearing in the court

for all intents and purposes for the proceeding conducted against him. Even

when the plaintiff's witnesses were examined defendant remained absent

and did not cross examine the witnesses. Drawing attention of this court to

the provision of Order XVII Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the

learned counsel for the petitioner would argue that a case would be

construed to be decided inter party at absence of any party if the

absentee party is deemed present by operation of explanation to Order

XVII Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Mr. NK Kalita has placed

reliance on a judgment of this court in the case of Ramusa Khatoon Mustt.

and <a href="/doc/1226007/" id="a_2">ors v. Durga Kakati and ors</a> reported in 2007 (1) GLT 886. In that

case also defendant approached this Court challenging a decision given by

the first appellate court holding that the proceeding was an inter party one

as defendant should be deemed to have been present when the evidence of

the plaintiff was recorded. This court while deciding the case considered

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                               Page 3 of 11</span>
CRP (I/O) 49 of 2014
 the provision of Order XVII Rule 2 and its explanation and found that this

provision spoke of an absentee party whose evidence was recorded fully or

in part. This court found that if after a party leads his evidence

substantially and thereafter defaults in appearing in the Court and court

decides the case in his absence, in that event such absentee party should

be deemed to have been present and in that event it would be an inter-

party proceeding. But if in case, a party did not lead any evidence at all, in

that event mischief of the explanation under Rule 2 of Order XVII would

not come into play and so any order or judgment or decree passed by the

court under Order IX of the Code of Civil Procedure read with provision of

Order XVII Rule 2 thereof would really be an ex-parte judgment. Once it

is found that a particular judgment and decree was an ex-parte one, it

would be possible to hold that the provision of Order IX Rule 13 would not

be applicable thereto.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.    Per contra, Mr. P Roy, learned counsel for the sole opposite party

would argue that no order has been passed by the learned Trial court

holding that the proceeding was conducted ex-parte against the defendant.

The defendant filed the written statement and thereafter stopped

appearing w.e.f. 02.02.2009. Plaintiff led evidence, examined his witnesses

but defendant or her counsel did not appear to cross examine the

witnesses of the plaintiff. It is under such circumstances, the cross

examination was considered to be declined and the evidence of the

plaintiff was closed. Thereafter, the learned Trial court fixed the case for

evidence by defendant but on the date fixed for the purpose defendant

did not appear. According to Mr. P Roy, ex-parte judgment will be one

where the defendant at all does not appear and does not file the written

statement. In the case in hand, defendant initially appeared, submitted

written statement and contested the case. So, the judgment ultimately

passed cannot be said to be an ex-parte one.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.    Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of

the materials on record, the undisputed position which is noticeable in the

present proceeding is that after receipt of summon, the defendant


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                 Page 4 of 11</span>
CRP (I/O) 49 of 2014
 appeared in the case, filed written statement and contested the claim of

money decree made by the plaintiff. Issues were framed and the parties

were put to place their respective evidence. At this stage the defendant

stopped appearing in the court w.e.f. 02.02.2009 and in all subsequent

dates he absented from the court. Now the question arises whether such

absence of the defendant can be deemed to be his presence in the court

under Order XVII Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. A bare perusal of

the provision shows that such a deemed situation would arise if the

absentee party participated in the evidence stage of the proceeding to

such a substantial extent so as to enable the court to arrive at a decision.

In that case, it would be inter-parte proceeding and not ex parte one.

Question arises as to when can a hearing be called as ex parte hearing. Ex-

parte hearing has been defined in Black's Law Dictionary as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                     "Ex parte, adj. (17c) Done or made at the instance and for the

              benefit of one party only, and without notice to, or argument by, any

              person adversely interested; of or relating to court action taken by one

              party without notice to the other, usu. for temporary or emergency

              relief &lt;an ex parte hearing&gt; &lt;an ex parte injunction&gt;. Despite the

              traditional one-sidedness of ex parte matters, some courts now require

              notice to the opposition before what they call an "ex parte hearing."-

              Sometimes spelled exparte.- ex parte, adv."


</blockquote><p id="p_10">6.     So, an ex parte hearing means one-sided hearing where the opponent

remains absent and does not oppose the move of the plaintiff. The court

has to decide the dispute after hearing only the plaintiff. Naturally, court

becomes saddled with an additional responsibility in the matter of ex parte

hearing to arrive at a finding as to whether on the basis of the materials

placed by the plaintiff a decree as prayed for can be passed. The ex parte

hearing is different from decreeing a suit on admission under the provision

of Order XII Rule 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure where admission of the

opponent forms basis of judgment. In ex parte, plaintiff has to provide the

court with material to form an opinion. A decree cannot be passed at the

mere ipse dixit of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_11">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                       Page 5 of 11</span>
CRP (I/O) 49 of 2014
</p><p id="p_12"> 7.    Next question would be when can an order for ex parte hearing of a

suit be passed. Under Order VIII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure

such an occasion may also come. Order VIII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil

Procedure provides that if defendant does not file written statement

within the time permitted for the purpose or fixed by the court, in that

event court shall pronounce judgment against him or make such order as

the court may deem fit and proper. So after defendant is found to have

defaulted in filing written statement within the time either fixed by the

statute or permitted by the court not only can the court pass a judgment

on the basis of the pleadings of plaintiff, it can also pass an order deciding

to proceed ex parte against the defendant. This is because Order VIII

Rule 10 has vested court with much wide power not only for passing

judgment but also for any order it deems fit and proper. If in a given case,

court is satisfied that mere perusal of the plaint is not sufficient to pass

the judgment, court may fix the matter for ex parte hearing and ask the

plaintiff to lead evidence either for furnishing material particulars in

support of the material facts pleaded in the plaint or for any other cause.

For ready reference, Order VIII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure is

quoted below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                    "10.    Procedure   when   party   fails   to   present   written

             statement called for by Court.- Where any party from whom a

             written statement is required under rule 1 or rule 9 fails to present

             the same within the time permitted or fixed by the Court, as the case

             may be, the Court shall pronounce judgment against him, or make such

             order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit and on the pronouncement

             of such judgment a decree shall be drawn up."


</blockquote><p id="p_13">8.    The next scope for passing an order to proceed ex parte against the

defendant is available under Order IX Rule 6 of the Code of Civil

Procedure when the suit passes on to the hearing stage after filing of

written statement and framing of issues. Order IX Rule 6 lays down the

procedure when only plaintiff appears. Order IX Rule 6 is quoted below:-




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                      Page 6 of 11</span>
CRP (I/O) 49 of 2014
                     "6.       Procedure when only plaintiff appears.- (1) Where the

             plaintiff appears and the defendant does not appear when the suit is

             called on for hearing, then--
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                    (a)       When summons duly served- If it is proved that the

                              summons was duly served, the Court may make an order

                              that the suit be heard ex parte;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                    (b)       When summons not duly served- If it is not proved

                              defendant;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                    (c)       When summons served but not in due time- If it is

                              answer on the day fixed in the summons, the Court shall

                              postpone the hearing of the suit to a future day to be

                              fixed by the Court, and shall direct notice of such day

                              to be given to the defendant.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">
</blockquote><p id="p_15">             (2)    Where it is owing to the plaintiff's default that the summons

             was not duly served or was not served in sufficient time, the Court

             shall order the plaintiff to pay the costs occasioned by the

             postponement."
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">9.    It would appear from Order IX Rule 6 (a) that when summons are

duly served but plaintiff only appears when the matter is called up for

hearing and the defendant does not appear in that event court may make an

order that suit would be heard ex parte. So, even if defendant contests a

suit by filing written statement and argue on the first day of hearing i.e.

the hearing for framing of issues, then also an order to proceed ex parte

against the defendant can be passed by the court provided defendant does

not appear. The last exigency of absenting defendant in course of hearing

is dealt with under Order XVII Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It

provides if both parties or any of them fail to appear when the suit is

called up for hearing, court may proceed to dispose of the suit in any one

of the modes directed in that behalf by Order IX or may also make such

other order as it may think fit and proper. There is an explanation under



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                       Page 7 of 11</span>
CRP (I/O) 49 of 2014
 Order IX Rule 6 which provides that when such defaulting party had

already led evidence partially prior to such default then court may itself

proceed with the case in its discretion as if, such defaulting party is

present in the court. This means that once court proceeds to hear a suit

under Order XVII Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure when the

defaulting party had led some of its evidence in that event he would be

deemed to be present during the course of trial and consequently decree

passed by way of such hearing would not be considered to be an ex parte

decree. The Order XVII Rule 2 along with its explanation is quoted below:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                    "2.       Procedure if parties fail to appear on day fixed.--

             Where, on any day to which the hearing of the suit is adjourned, the

exigencies when plaintiff appears but defendant does not appear. In clause

</p><p id="p_19">(a) of Order IX Rule 6(1) it is provided that when summon is duly served

but defendant does not appear in that event suit would be heard ex-parte

against the defendant. Now Order IX Rule 6 deals with the case when it is

fixed for hearing. Hearing of a case comes subsequent to filing of pleadings

by the parties. Only after defendant files his written statement first,

hearing of a suit is done under Order XIV Rule 1 of the Code of Civil

Procedure and issues are framed. Thereafter, suit passes on to the second

phase, namely, the phase of trial i.e. examination of witnesses by the

parties. It is the stage of hearing of the suit and so applicability of Order

IX of the Code of Civil Procedure is undisputed when the suit is fixed at

evidence stage. Irrespective of whether court records that the suit would

be heard ex-parte against defendant in that case but for all intents and

        Now the next question arises what is the consequence of passing of

such order. After court takes recourse to the provision of Order IX Rule

6(1)(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure in that event unless the order is set

aside the absentee party would not be able to lead his evidence but he

would be entitled to cross examine the witnesses examined by the plaintiff

side.

day witnesses were examined by the plaintiff by filing affidavit or

otherwise, the next date was fixed for cross examination by the

defendant. The defendant failed to cross examine the witnesses on the

fixed dates and thereafter trial court fixed the case for evidence by the

defendant side. Here in this case, defendant remained all along absent and

so fixing the case for his evidence after closure of the evidence of the

plaintiff was not at his prayer. Had the court passed appropriate order

under Order IX Rule 6(1)(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure, in that event

there would have been an order by the learned court specifically holding

that the suit would be heard ex-parte against the defendant. The

difficulty has arisen only because learned court failed to pass an express

order under Order IX Rule 6 (1)(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure. Failure

on the part of the court to pass an express order while really proceeding

 ex-parte against the defendant cannot change the nature and character of

the ex-parte. If it was the intention of the learned court not to proceed

ex-parte although defendant was absent on the date of hearing, he would

have been at liberty to adjourned the suit by taking recourse to the

provision of Order XVII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. What has

been done by the trial court is that he accepted the evidence in the

absence of the defendant and so for all intents and purposes the suit really

proceeded ex-parte against the defendant.

Kakati and ors</a> (supra) considered similar facts and circumstances and held

that when defendant does not appear to lead evidence and does not lead

evidence, he will not come within sweep of explanation to Order XVII Rule

2 of the Code of Civil Procedure and so such a suit will be considered to

have proceeded ex-parte against the defendant and Order IX Rule 13 of

the Code of Civil Procedure will be applicable in such cases. Having gone

through the reported judgment and comparing the same with the facts and

circumstances of the present case, I do not find any reason to differ from

the view taken by a Coordinate Bench of this Court on earlier occasion. This
