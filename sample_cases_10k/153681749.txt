</pre><p id="p_5">        Facts as borne out from the complaint are as follows:
</p><p id="p_6">1.      The case set up by complainant is that in the first week of January
2008 accused approached the complainant for short term loan and on the
request of accused, complainant agreed to give loan of Rs. 3,00,000/-. The
accused agreed to return the same with interest @ 24% per annum within
three months. It is further alleged that in March 2008, accused asked for an
additional loan of Rs. 2,00,000/- and agreed to return the total amount of
Rs. 5,00,000/- alongwith interest by 15th of April, 2008. In discharge of
liability towards the payment, accused had issued a cheque No. 751144
dated 27.6.2008     Rs. 2,60,000/-    drawn on UCO Bank, Patiala House
 Courts, New Delhi, which was returned unpaid on presentation by the
drawer banks for "Funds Insufficient" vide return memo dated 1.8.2008.
The complainant made a demand for the payment of the said amount of
money by giving a demand notice dated 29.8.2008 to accused through
registered A.D and postal receipt. Statutory notice of demand was duly
served upon accused but accused failed to make the payment of the said
amount to complainant within 15 days of receipt of the said Demand Notice.
Thereafter the complainant has filed this complaint U/S 138 of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_3">Negotiable
Instrument Act</a>, 1881 (hereinafter " the Act") against the accused.
</p>

<p id="p_7">2.        On 29.9.2009 the Court took cognizance of the offence U/s 138 of
the Act. On being satisfied that the complainant has a prima facie case
against the accused the Court summoned the accused for offence U/s 138
of the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_8">3.        On 21.2.2009 accused appeared pursuant to the summons issued
by the Court.
</p>

<p id="p_9">4.        On 26.8.2009 the particulars of the offence were read over and
explained to the accused in simple Hindi, to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial.
</p>

<p id="p_10">5.        In order to substantiate its case, the complainant examined himself
as CW1, who has deposed vide affidavit. On 18.8.2009 the evidence was
closed.
</p>

<p id="p_11">6.        All the circumstances appearing in the evidence against the
accused were put in order to enable him to offer his explanation. In his
examination U/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">Cr.P.C</a>, the accused has admitted his liability and
further submitted that he does not have any defence to adduce.
</p><p id="p_12"> 7.     I have heard arguments of learned counsels for complainant and ld
counsel for the defence and perused the relevant statutory provisions and
evidence   alongwith written arguments filed on record. It is argued by
counsel for complainant that from evidence, complainant has proved that
the cheque in question was signed by accused which were dishonoured
and despite service of legal notice, accused did not make payment. It is
argued that accused nowhere has denied or disputed his signatures on
cheques. It is argued that admittedly accused pursuant to his undertaking
on 21.2.2009 to pay the total amount of cheques in two installments has
failed in such payment.
</p>

<p id="p_13">8.     Before embarking upon the factual issue involved herein, let us
consider the provisions of <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_5">Section 138</a> of Act. The requirements are :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       (1) there is a legally enforceable debt
       (2) the drawer of the cheque issued the cheque to satisfy the whole
       or the part of the debt
       (3) the cheque so issued has been returned due to insufficiency of
       funds.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_14">9.     <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_6">Section 138</a> of the Act merely raises a presumption in regard to the
second aspect of the matter. The existence of legally recoverable debt is
not a matter of presumption U/S 139 of the Act. It merely raises a
presumption in favour of holder of the cheque that the same has been
issued for discharge of any debt or other liability. From the aforestated
settled legal principles, it is crystal clear that <a href="/doc/517539/" id="a_7">Section 118</a> of the Act
envisages legal presumption that the cheque was drawn for consideration
on the date which the cheque bears. The accused must adduce evidence
showing the reasonable possibility of non existence of the Presumed Fact.
The presumption has to be rebutted by proof and not by a statement or
plausible explanation. The present case is a clear cut case of admission of
liability of accused. Despite an undertaking given on 21.2.2009, accused
has failed to discharge the liability. Having gone through the provisions of
 Section138 of the Act, it is clear that evidence U/s 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_8">N.I. Act</a> casts
criminal liability punishable with imprisonment or fine or both on a person
who issues cheque towards the discharge of a debt or liability as a whole or
in part and the cheque is dishonoured by bank on presentation.
</p>

<p id="p_15">10.     It is proved on record that accused despite service of statutory
notice of demand failed to make the payment of the cheque in question i.e
No. 751144 within 15 days from receipt thereof. The complainant has
fulfilled all the ingredients of <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_9">Section 138</a> of the N.I. Act. Accordingly,
accused is guilty for committing the offence U/ S 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_10">N.I. Act</a>. Let he be
heard on the point of sentence on 28.1.2010 at 3.00 PM.

ORDER ON SENTENCE
Present:    Complainant in person with Counsel Shri Priyani.
</p><p id="p_17">            Convict in person with counsel.
</p><p id="p_18">1.    I have heard the convict and his counsel on the Point of Sentence.
</p><p id="p_19">2.    It is submitted that convict has been appearing continuously since
the inception of the complaint. It is argued that due to huge financial
crunches, the convict who happens to be an Advocate, had to dispose off
his chamber at Patiala House Complex for the study of his son, who is
studying in NASA in USA.          It is argued that convict has no previous
antecedents and the learned counsel for the convict has prayed that a
lenient view be taken in the present matter.
</p>

<p id="p_20">3.    Counsel for the complainant to the contrary argues that complainant
is an old man of 72 years of age and there is absolutely no defence put up
by convict in the proceedings. It is argued that despite the undertakings to
pay, the convict did not abide by such undertakings. It is argued that the
convict is not a layman. He is an advocate and being a legal officer, he is
aware of the consequences entailing the provisions of 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_12">NI Act</a> and
therefore, does not deserve any leniency. It is argued that another
complaint U/S 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_13">NI Act</a> against the convict is also pending before Ld.
M.M. Shri Sandeep Yadav. It is argued, therefore, that he be punished with
maximum punishment provided and he does not deserve any leniency.
Therefore, Ld. counsel for complainant has prayed for taking strict view
under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_14">NI Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_21"> 4.    I have heard respective parties at bar. I have also considered the
past antecedents of convict and the circumstances of the case. Sentencing
is a judicial discretion and Court should not shy away from sentencing the
convict adequately in befitting circumstances. The offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_15">Section
138</a> NI has been introduced to encourage greater vigilance to prevent the
usual callous attitude of drawer of cheque and to lend greater credibility to
the transactions.
</p>

<p id="p_22">5.    Considering the circumstances, it would be appropriate to sentence
the convict to simple imprisonment for six months alongwith fine of Rs.
3,00,000/- as per <a href="/doc/45362031/" id="a_16">Section 143</a> (1) (Proviso) NI Act r/w <a href="/doc/1365288/" id="a_17">Section 357(1)(b)</a> of
Cr.P.C. Out of this amount, Rs. 2,60,000/- (being cheque amount) shall be
payable to the complainant as compensation and Rs. 3,000/- to state within
a month from today. In default of payment of fine payable to state, convict
shall further undergo imprisonment for three months.
</p><p id="p_23">6.    It is ordered that the compensation amount if not paid in time, shall be
recoverable under the provisions of <a href="/doc/89440/" id="a_18">Section 421</a> Cr.P.C.
</p><p id="p_24">7.    At this stage, counsel for convict prays for for suspension of
sentence Under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_19">section 389</a> (3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_20">Cr.P.C</a>, for filing the
appeal by convict and request is made for releasing him on bail.
Heard.
</p><p id="p_25">            Surety Shri Santosh Kumar Advocate is present.
            Since convict intends to present an appeal, he is hereby
admitted to bail on furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs 30,000/- with
one surety in the like amount.
</p><p id="p_26">            Bail bond furnished and accepted till 21.3.2010. Copy of order
be given dasti.
