<p id="p_1">              The present petition lays challenge to order dated 29.01.2014

(Annexure P-4) passed by the Civil Judge (Senior Division), Ludhiana

whereby claim of the petitioners for allowing benefits as per award dated

22.05.1985 (Annexure P-1) modified vide order dated 06.08.1986

(Annexure P-3) has been dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">              Counsel for the petitioners would contend that Land

Acquisition Case (in short 'LAC') No.244 of 29.11.1978 titled Smt.

Vidwan Kaur and others Vs. Punjab State and others was decided by the

Land Acquisition Tribunal, Ludhiana Improvement Trust, Ludhiana, on the



                                       1 of 4

basis of findings recorded in LAC No.245 of 1978 titled Har Lal Vs.

Improvement Trust, Ludhiana and others, whereby market value of the

acquired land immediately abutting the link road and upto depth of 10

Karams was assessed at Rs.235/- per square yard and of the remaining land

at the rate of Rs.155/- per square yard with interest at the rate of 6% per

annum on enhanced compensation besides 15% solatium. Har Lal, the

award holder in LAC No.245 of 1978 filed an application for review of the

award that was allowed by the Land Acquisition Tribunal vide order dated

06.08.1986 (Annexure P-3) and the award dated 22.05.1985 (Annexure P-

</p><p id="p_3">1) was modified holding the petitioner therein entitled to 30% solatium

over the entire compensation besides an amount equal to 12% per annum

on the compensation from the date of publication of notice under Section

36 of the Punjab Town Improvement Act 1922, i.e. 08.07.1975 till the date

of delivery of possession i.e. 11.08.1978. The petitioner was further held

entitled to 9% per annum interest on the enhanced compensation as well as

solatium in view of findings of the High Court in State of Haryana Vs.

Smt. Kailash Wati and others, 1980 PLR 122, for the first year from the

date of dispossession and 15% per annum for the remaining period till the

date of payment.
</p>
<p id="p_4">               It is argued with vehemence that as the award in favour of the

petitioners while disposing of LAC No.244 of 29.11.1979 was passed on

the basis of findings of the Tribunal recorded in LAC No.245 of 1978, the

petitioners are also entitled to the same benefit as has been awarded in the

case of Har Lal by allowing review petition vide order dated 06.08.1986

(Annexure P-3).         According to counsel, the executing Court has

committed a serious error rather illegality in denying the said benefit to the

petitioners.

             Counsel(s) for the contesting respondents have supported the

impugned order with the submissions that as the petitioners never

expressed their grievance against award dated 22.05.1985 (Annexure P-1)

that has attained finality between the parties, they cannot derive any

advantage from the modification made only in the case of Har Lal.

</p><p id="p_6">             I have heard counsel for the parties, perused the records

particularly the annexures appended with the petition.

</p><p id="p_7">             The executing Court in para 5 of the impugned order has held

that the executing Court cannot go beyond the decree and only award to be

executed is the award dated 22.05.1985 passed in LAC No.244 of

29.11.1978. It has further been held that the decree holders are not a party

to modification of award passed in LAC No.245 of 1978 vide order dated

06.08.1986, therefore, the modification dated 06.08.1986 in LAC No.245

of 1978 cannot enure to benefit of the petitioners.

</p><p id="p_8">             Counsel for the petitioners has failed to invite attention of this

Court to any provision in the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_1">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894 or a precedent

which entitles the petitioners to claim benefit of order dated 06.08.1986

passed in LAC No.245 of 1978. The mere fact that LAC No.244 of

29.11.1978 was decided on the basis of findings recorded in LAC No.245

of 1978 would not ipso facto amount to review of award passed in LAC

No.244 of 29.11.1978 whereby the petitioners were awarded compensation

in reference under <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_2">Section 18</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Even it

is not plea of the petitioners that they were co-sharers of Har Lal in order

to claim that benefit of order dated 06.08.1986 (Annexure P-3) is liable to

be extended to them without their having filed an application for review.

</p><p id="p_9">             In view of the above, I do not find any error much less

illegality in the impugned order warranting intervention.

</p><p id="p_10">                                    3 of 4

              For the foregoing reasons, the petition fails and is accordingly

dismissed.
