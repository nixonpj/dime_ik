                        Accused-Ranjit Singh and his brother Daljit Singh were the sons

                        of real Massi of her husband and, thus, related to her as Jeths.

                        Daljit Singh was settled in Holland. Accused-Ranjit Singh and his

                        people abroad. In the year 2008, the prosecutrix got married to

                        Jagtar Singh against the wishes of her parents as it was inter-

                        caste marriage. Accused-Ranjit Singh and Daljit Singh visited her

                        village in the year 2009 and assured her that they would send her

                        and her husband to a foreign country. After some time Daljit

                        Singh went back to Holland. Accused-Ranjit Singh, his daughter

                        Rupinder Kaur and brother Daljit Singh demanded a sum of

                        Rs.28,00,000/- from the prosecutrix and her husband for sending

                        them to Holland. They assured them that they would also have a

                        share in the show room. As the prosecutrix and her husband

                        were poor people, they could not arrange such a huge amount.

                        Both the accused got transferred one acre of land belonging to

                        the father-in-law of the prosecutrix with the assurance that they

                        would be settled abroad. In the meantime, accused-Ranjit Singh

                        started keeping evil eye on the prosecutrix. In the absence of her

                        husband, he developed physical relations with her. When she

                        opposed him, he threatened her that their file for sending abroad

                        will be closed and the money paid in advance misappropriated.

                        Due to the same, the prosecutrix could not oppose the accused,

                        who continued to have physical relations with her. Daljit Singh

                        also asked the prosecutrix to have physical relations with him. He

                        threatened her that in case she opposed him, they would not be

                        taken to a foreign country.    Rather, he would disclose to her

                        husband regarding her relations with his brother Ranjit Singh.

                        Daljit Singh also raped her. Accused-Ranjit Singh got transferred

                        land of her father-in-law by executing registered sale-deed. The

                        prosecutrix and her husband kept on waiting that the accused

                        would prepare their papers for sending them abroad. Ultimately,

                        in the year 2012, the accused refused to send them abroad. The

                        prosecutrix demanded the return of the registered sale-deeds

                        vide which their land was transferred in favour of the accused.

                        She filed a complaint before the Senior Superintendent of Police,

                        Fatehgarh Sahib, on the basis of which FIR No. 3 dated

                        17.1.2013 was registered against accused-Ranjit Singh under

                        <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_4">Section 420</a> IPC. In the said complaint, the prosecutrix did not

                        mention about commission of rape as she was told that the

                        incident of rape took place in village Mughal Majri, District Ropar.

                        Accordingly, she filed the complaint at Ropar which was marked

                        to DSP (Rural) for investigation. The statements of the parties

                        were recorded. Ultimately, FIR No. 29 dated 15.4.2013 under

                        <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_5">Section 376</a> IPC and <a href="/doc/42436223/" id="a_6">Section 3</a> (1)(XII) of the Act was registered

                        offences, the prosecution examined eleven witnesses in support

                        husband as PW5.

                                   When examined under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_7">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., the

                        accused denied the case of the prosecution in toto and pleaded

                        innocence. In defence, he examined his daughter Rupinder Kaur

                        as DW1.

<p id="p_5">                                   After hearing learned counsel for the parties and on

                        going through the evidence brought on record, the trial Court

                        came to the conclusion that the prosecution had miserably failed

                        to bring home the guilt of the accused for the aforementioned

                        offences. Accordingly, the accused was acquitted of the charges

                        and perused the impugned judgment passed by the trial Court.

</p><p id="p_7">                                   According to the prosecutrix, as and when members

                        of her family would not be present in the house, the accused

                        would commit rape upon her. He was threatening her that if she

                        disclosed about the said fact to any one, her file for sending

                        abroad would be closed and earnest money given to him would

                        be forfeited.   On account of the said fact, the prosecutrix

                        remained silent and the accused continued to commit rape upon

                        her for a period spreading over three years. However, it is the

                        prosecution case itself that the accused was none else but the

                        first cousin of her husband. Further, the prosecutrix was 32 years

                        of age while the accused 47 years of age. The latter had a grown

                        up daughter aged about 25/26 years and son about 23 years' old.

                        Said daughter of the accused stepped into the witness box as

                        DW1 and testified that she alongwith her parents and grand-

                        mother, who was about 78 years of age, lived in the house.

                        Under these circumstances, it is difficult to hold that the accused

                        would have indulged in committing rape upon the prosecutrix.

</p><p id="p_8">                                   In her testimony before the trial Court, the prosecutrix

                        admitted that she was earlier married to Sohan Singh but the said

                        marriage ended in a Panchayati divorce.         However, as per

                        certified copy of the judgment and decree brought on record by

                        the accused, said Sohan Singh had obtained ex parte divorce on

                        16.7.2008. Subsequently, the prosecutrix was engaged with Baljit

                        Singh son of Nirmal Singh, resident of Fatehgarh Sahib but the

                        engagement was broken. She then married Jagtar Singh which

                        was an inter-caste marriage and against the wishes of her

                        parents. The prosecutrix appears to be a mature and worldly

                        wise lady. Despite the same, she did not raise her voice till she

                        submitted complaint dated 31.1.2013. In the said complaint, she

                        did not level allegations of commission of rape against accused-

                        her voice till the time when she submitted complaint Ex. PA on

                        complaint   dated    7.5.2012   Ex.   DA    before   the   Senior

                        Superintendent of Police, Fatehgarh Sahib. In the said complaint

                        also there were no allegations of commission of rape against

                        accused-Ranjit Singh or his brother Daljit Singh.     During the

                        enquiry of the said complaint, the statement of the prosecutrix

                        was recorded by the DSP, which is available on the record as

                        Ex.DB. Even in the said statement, the prosecutrix did not level

                        allegations of commission of rape.

<p id="p_9">                                    Prior to the complaint Ex. PA dated 31.1.2013, civil

                        and criminal litigation had started between the accused and the

                        family of the prosecutrix. Sale-deed dated 20.7.2009 had been

                        executed by Kesar Singh, father-in-law of the prosecutrix,

                        regarding 8 acres of land in favour of accused-Ranjit Singh. This

                        fact was not denied by the prosecutrix during her cross-

                        examination as PW1. She only stated that the land purchased by

                        the accused was acquired and she had filed application before

                        the Deputy Commissioner not to release the amount in favour of

                        the accused. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that

                        the prosecution had been successful in establishing the guilt of

                        the accused of the offence under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_9">Section 376</a> IPC.

                        suffice it to state that though the prosecutrix testified that the

                        accused had proclaimed that she belonged to a scheduled caste
