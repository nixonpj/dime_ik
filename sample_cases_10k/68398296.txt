revisionist    that the entire loan with due interest

were deposited with the bank on the due dates but

contrary to the undertaking and assurance given by

the revisionist     the cheque bounced           and returned

unpaid due to the reasons insufficiency of funds . The

second cheque       also bounced         and the third cheque

also bounced,      an application was moved before the

court concerned      when the cheques bounced .             The

notice was also given but despite service of notice no

payment    was     made.       ld.       MM     summoned    the

respondent      for the offence punishable U/s 138 of

<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_2">Negotiable Instrument Act</a>. Notice u/s 251 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3">Cr.P.C</a> for

the   offence     punishable       u/s    138    of   <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_4">Negotiable

Instrument Act</a> was given to the respondent to which

she pleaded not guilty and claimed trial and thereafter

case was fixed for evidence. Complainant examined

himself as witness , statement of respondent was

recorded u/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a> wherein she had denied that

she had taken a loan of Rs 75 lacs                however she
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            5</span>

admitted that she entered into compromise with the

revisionist   which was filed   in the court on 3/1/98

and the compromise      deed is Ex PW1/J      alongwith

her affidavits   which is Ex PW1/K . She stated that

she was made to sign and was told by both the parties

that she will not be involved any more. She also stated

that      three post dated cheques in the sum of Rs

32,24,000/- were handed over to the revisionist       in

term of compromise      but she stated that both the

parties     i.e. H.S.Narula ( Harpender Singh Narula)

Chairman D.S corporation in the presence of Sh. Nam

Dhari Mehra and the Cabinet Secy. Of India at that

time told her that she will be no more troubled and

will not be called to court. They had told her that they

will themselve settled the dispute . She admitted that

the cheques bearing her signatures. She also admitted

that when these cheques were presented the same

were returned dishonoured due to insufficiency of

funds alongwith the bank memo        dt 18/2/98.    She

stated that she had not dealing with the revisionist .

She stated that it is a false case and that she is

innocent . She had no dealings with the complainant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                              6</span>

, therefore there is no question of making any payment

to the complainant. She met H.S.Narula for the first

time in 1995 ( July)    at that time she had been told by

the Cabinet Secretary's wife who happens to be her

cousin that they were       doing some transcations at

Khanpur at their farm for making a motel resort and

required certain favours . Certain amount had been

paid or were being paid or had been agreed to be paid

by the complainant to the Cabinet Secretary . However

she was not aware about the facts. She had gone to

Cabinet Secretary      for admission       of her son where

the Cabinet Secretary's wife told her that they needed

some help from her as they wanted to do payments in

cheque as well as in cash. She was asked by the wife

of Cabinet secretary to help her in that regard. That

was detailed in the writ petition u/s 482 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a>          .

She    wish to lead evidence in her defence and

examined     5 witnesses         and thereafter     defence

evidence was closed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            ld.   MM     after   hearing    the   arguments

passed the order of conviction and sentence which is

under challenged in the present revisions.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                               7</span>

</p><p id="p_9">              The only issue       before this court in the

revisions     is of quantum of sentence. Notice of the

revisions was given to the respondent no 2 . she also

appeared      before this court. Trial court records were

requisitioned.
</p>
<p id="p_10">              I have heard the ld. Counsel for the

revisionist, ld. Counsel for respondent and perused

the record.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">              ld. Counsel for the revisionist submitted

that the order passed by the ld. Trial court is bad in

law contrary to the facts and circumstances             on

record. Court had side lined the actual sufferings of

the revisionist . Inspite of the fact that huge amount

of money of the petitioner is lost in this case but the

Hon'ble court did not             grant any compensation

amount to the petitioner            and the quantum of

sentence is also very less though the legislature has

now   provided        for   sentence      of   two   years

imprisonment instead of one year.              ld. Counsel

submitted that respondent no 2 is a habitual cheat.

She had not only cheated the complainant but also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                            8</span>

played fraud with the court . She issued the cheque,

in view of the    compromise      reached between the

parties which was also filed in the court, knowing and

having intention that    cheque    is not going   to be

honoured . Ld. Counsel      submitted that keeping in

view all these facts ld. Trial court should have awarded

the compensation equivalent to double the amount of

the dishonoured cheque amount      which has not been

done. The order of ld. Trial court is bad in law. ld.

Counsel further submits that the order of ld. Trial

court be set aside and modify the sentence and grant

relief by way of compensation equivalent      to double

the amount of the dishonored cheque and also

enhance the sentence of the respondent no 2 to two

years RI.
</p>
<p id="p_13">            ld. Counsel for respondent submits that

respondent is a lady , she has no previous criminal

record. She is not a habitual criminal . ld. Counsel

submitted that infact she is victim of circumstances.

She had not    received any money. It is prayed that

keeping in view the fact that respondent is a lady a

lenient view be taken. It is prayed that revision be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                               9</span>

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_14">              After hearing the arguments and going

through the record         I found that it is a case of

bouncing of cheque no doubt amount of Rs 75 lacs is

involved but as the respondent/ convict is a lady, in

my opinion ld. Trial court had rightly taken a lenient

view . I do not find any reason to differ with the

opinion of ld. Trial court. Above said revision

petition is, therefore, dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">              Respondent also preferred appeal against

the order of conviction and sentence but only appeal

was preferred against the order alleging that as the

three cases were disposed off with single order.

Notice of the appeal was given to the D.S.Capital . ld.

Counsel for the appellant submitted that petitioner (

appellant)    does not dispute the compromise            deed

before the court and issuance of cheques . The

cheques      were   also   dishonored   .   Affidavits   were

received by the appellant. She tried to contact the

respondent      but they remained evasive.        Thereafter

petitions were filed for quashing of the proceedings
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                           10</span>

as no consideration whatsoever was ever passed to

the appellant regarding issuance of these cheques it

is claimed that the entire episode is a classical case

of bribe being paid through cheques to a high officer

of the Government of India        by ensuring   counter

cheques by a person who was made a stooge in the

entire scheme. Appellant having been shattered on

account of death of her husband         ,she sold   her

personal belongings to carry on her day to day means

and she could not leave           the country without

permission of the court. But in the proceedings u/s

482 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a>     the High Court opined that in these

proceedings    court would not be in a position       to

decide the question of fact involved in the         said

petition and could be decided only in the court .

Hon'ble High Court opined as :-
</p>
<p id="p_17">" As regards the proceedings of the complaint cases for

offences   under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_8">section 138</a> of Negotiable instrument

Act is concerned , the questions which have been raised

about   non -passing   of any consideration     and the

complaint that the petitioner was being used only as a

conduit and a stooge for the purpose of passing of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                      11</span>

bribe      , it is evident        that unless    and until   all the

parties come in witness box , it may not be possible at

all to answer           these questions     by definitely stating

and giving         finding whether any consideration            did

actually pass or did not pass to the petitioner."



</p><p id="p_18">                  ld.       Counsel       submitted     that    Sh.
</p>
<p id="p_19">H.S.Narula was admittedly controlling all the affairs of

his firms . He had not appeared in the witness box .

He even tried to avoid answer                   when appeared as

defence witness but defence of the appellant is that

the cheques in questions were without consideration.

H.S.Narula          was ultimately summoned as defence

witness . The ld. Counsel further                 submitted     that

record would show that the appellant procured the

presence       of H.S.Narula         and he appeared only after

issuing of NBWs against him. He admitted that two

cheques of Rs 6 crores in favour of the appellant were

issued but could not explain the reason for the same.

ld. Trial court has failed to appreciate that from the

testimony of defence witnesses it stands proved                 that

in   all    the     firms    of    H.S.Narula       including   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                            12</span>

respondent company Sh. H.S.Narula was handling

all the affairs of these companies and was the person

responsible who managed to get the cheques issued

from the appellant by playing fraud and coercion. Ld.

Trial court          also failed to appreciate          that

Sh.H.S.Narula     in his statement accepted          that he

issued     two cheques dt 3/2/96 in the sum of Rs 3

crores 50 lacs and 2 crores 50 lacs in favour of the

appellant    and had further accepted       having    signed

the note at the back of the both the cheques which

reads as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_20">" This cheque is to be presented for payment only on

the condition of fulfillment of terms as mentioned in

the agreement dt 3/1/96 and signed by the company

and Mrs. Jamwal for allotment of land and getting its

building      drawings   and    plans   sanctioned       for

construction ."
</p>
<p id="p_21">" The cheque is to be presented for payment only on

the condition of fulfillment of terms as mentioned in he

bond dt 3/1/96 and signed          by the company         in

relation to land in Khanpur in Mehrauli."
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                              13</span>

</p><p id="p_22">               Ld. Counsel         submitted that from the

above notes appended at the back of both the cheques

it is clear   that there was some agreement               between

the parties in     relation to some construction over a

plot of land in Khanpur in Mehrauli . ld. Trial court

has failed to appreciate that the complainant has not

produced the said agreement              before the court,

reference of which was made on the back of said two

cheques. Adverse inference should be drawn against

the complainant/ respondent for not producing the

same and the defence of the appellant should have

been   accepted.       Sh.   H.S.Narula       in his cross

examination     had tried to       falsely explain        the note

appended at the back of the said two cheques by

falsely deposing    that the accused had a deal with

Conadia group for piece of land owned            by Conadia

Group opposite      IIT Gate . She        and her husband

wanted to complete that deal by selling of that land

alongwith other terms and conditions. The deal never

came through.          ld. Counsel submitted that the

explanation    given    by   Sh.    H.S.Narula       is    neither

convincing nor consistent with the note appended at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                            14</span>

the back of the said two cheques but it is consistent

with the defence of the appellant where she says that

H.S.Narula had approached Sh. Surender Singh the

then Cabinet Secretary     of Government of India     for

getting   permission for construction of a motel on that

piece of land situated near Khanpur Depot for which

H.S.Narula was asked to pay bribe      which he paid to

Surender Singh     through the appellant . ld. Counsel

submitted that     perusal of the record    shows that

complainant's     Authorized     Representative      Sh.

N.D.Mehra     had always tried to show non concer of

Sh H.S.Narula DW5 with the complainant company

and even Sh. H.S.Narula had tried to falsely explain

the reason for issuance of both cheques amounting to

Rs 6 crores in favour of the appellant . ld. Counsel

submitted that the trial court failed to appreciate if it

was short term loan      which the appellant failed to

return then why the fresh loan was given to the

revisionist by the respondent and sister concern, this

clearly establish that infact no loan was extended to

the appellant    by respondent     and the cheques    in

question were obtained by playing fraud and deceit
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                           15</span>

on her in order to protect         the interest of Sh

H.S.Narual so that in case Surender Singh fails to get

the work done for the complainant then action could

be taken atleast against her. ld. Counsel submitted

that ld. Trial court has not considered all these facts

and it is prayed that keeping in view all these facts

and the evidence    it is clear that cheaques     were

issued without consideration and hence no offence

punishable u/s 138 of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_9">Negotiable Act</a> was made out .

It is prayed that order of the ld. Trial court   be set

aside and accused/appellant be acquitted.

</p><p id="p_23">            ld. Counsel for the respondent submitted

that the cheques   in dispute were issued in view of

the compromise      reached before the court       and

admittedly the cheques were issued by the appellant

herein . The cheques also bounced . Service of notice

is also admitted . It is also   admitted   that cheques

were signed by her and no payment was made . ld.

Counsel submitted that now a new story is developed

that the cheques were issued without consideration

but no such defence is taken by the respondent and

even the compromise deed is accepted        wherein she
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                              16</span>

has admitted her liability to make the payment . One

document had been placed on record which is Ex

PW1/E it is dated 8/1/97 wherein she had admitted

that she would be refunding the loan of Rs 75 lacs

and pay towards outstanding            of Rs 4 lacs 30

thousand    upto 31/8/96.         Sh. H.S.Narula had also

written a letter dt 8/1/97 Ex PW1/F wherein he

confirmed that he stood guarantee to the repayment of

the amount of 75 lacs with interest. There is another

document Ex PW1/G reply to the notice wherein she

again admitted and acknowledged             the liability to

make the payment and that she is making effort to

arrange for the payment . ld. Counsel submitted that

notice was duly served and the appellant in her earlier

letters and communication admitted all these facts.

ld. Trial court has considered all these facts and

thereafter ld. Trial court   rightly held    the appellant

guilty. It is prayed that there is no merit in the appeal

and same be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_24">            After going through the record          I found

that in the present case factum of issuance of cheque

is not denied even in her statement u/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_10">Cr.P.C</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                            17</span>

she had stated that cheques were issued by her but

the defence   taken is that the cheques were issued

without any liability or consideration. In this respect

it is important to note that appellant herself had

written letter to the respondent which are Ex PW1/E

and G in both these letters she had admitted that she

had taken a loan of Rs 75 lacs and also admitted her

liability to repay that loan alongwith the interest. She

also admitted that she had issued the cheque which

had   bounced.   She had        already   admitted   that

compromise was reached between them i.e. Appellant

herein and the respondent         and that agreement is

proved on record as Ex PW1/D that matter was

compromised      between them and in view of that

compromise    she gave these three cheques        in the

court of ld. MM in discharge of her liability. The fact

shows that cheques were presented         for encashment

and same bounced      due to insufficiency of funds .

Notice was sent to the appellant . Now the appellant

has taken the defence that infact no payment         was

made to her and it was given to Surender Singh but

no such evidence has been brought on record.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                            18</span>

Surender Singh has not been examined to prove that

he has received any loan payment . H.S.Narula was

examined as defence witness. He has not supported

the story of defence. ld. Defence counsel has also

contended that H.S.Narula       had deposed falsely and

therefore action u/s 340   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11">Cr.P.C</a> be taken against him

but from the record I do not find anything on record

to infer that he had deposed falsely before the court or

tried to mis lead the court. I do not find it expedient

in the interest of justice to proceed against        Sh.

H.S.Narula . in the absence of any evidence that he

deposed falsely before the court simply because DW 5

had not supported the case of the appellant does not

mean that DW 5 is liable to be proceeded U/s 340

<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12">Cr.P.C</a>. From the above facts        as the issuance of

cheques   is admitted it is admitted by the appellant

herself in her    communication      that she had the

liability to repay the loan and also that her cheques

had bounced      and she is shortly arranging for the

money. It is also admitted that a compromise was

reached between the party wherein       she issued   the

cheques and those cheques also bounced. I am of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                              19</span>

opinion that this contention that the cheques were

issued without consideration         has no merit . It is

proved on record that the cheque bounced due to

insufficient    funds.   Notice    was   served   upon   the

appellant but despite service of notice the cheque

amount was not paid.
</p>
<p id="p_25">               After considering    all the facts   I found

myself unable to differ with the opinion of the ld. Trial

court. There is no merit in the appeal . Same is

dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_26">               Trial court record be sent back with the

copy of this order. Files be consigned to record room.
