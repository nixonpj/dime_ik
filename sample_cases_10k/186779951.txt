         Shri Aseem Dixit, learned G.A. for the respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">         Heard with the aid of case diary.
         This is first application under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> of the Cr.P.C. for grant of

  the prayer and submitted that sufficient evidence is available against the
