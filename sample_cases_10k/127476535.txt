QUASH THE CALENDAR OF EVENTS IN NO. SANI:48/REG:/
CR:43/REG.NO.43514/2012-13. DT.29.6.2012 VIDE ANNX-R.

     THESE PETITIONS COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS

                           ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.   In this batch of writ petition, petitioners are challenging

the calendar of events published on 06.07.2013 vide Annexure-

R, thereby continuing the election process for electing the
                                               WPs.32676-32688/2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              5</span>



members of the Managing Committee of Vyavasaya Seva

Sahakara    Sangha     Niyamitha,     Devasthanada      Hosahalli,

Chikkaballapur Taluk - respondent No.3 herein.


</p><p id="p_2">2.    In fact, a perusal of Annexure-R - calendar of events

would show that election for electing the Managing Committee

of the Society for the period from 2012-13 to 2016-17 was

scheduled to be held on 29.07.2013 and a calendar of events in

this regard had been earlier issued on 22.10.2012. Some of the

members of the Society had approached this Court by filing

W.P.No.46350/2012 seeking a direction to the Society and to

the Returning Officer to continue the election process from the

stage where it had been interrupted as per the calendar of

events   which   was   published    earlier   on   22.10.2012   by

rescheduling the dates. The order dated 11.01.2013 passed by

this Court in W.P.No.46350/2012 which is produced along with

an application I.A.3/2013 filed seeking to vacate the interim

order of stay by the counsel for the impleading applicants

makes it clear that the Returning Officer was directed to

continue the election process from the stage where it was

interrupted by rescheduling the dates. Two months time was
                                                        WPs.32676-32688/2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      6</span>



granted to complete the said process from the date of

receipt/production of the copy of the said order.


</p><p id="p_3">3.    Thereafter, another writ petition came to be filed in

W.P.Nos.2457-2470/2013 before this Court by the petitioners

and some others seeking a direction to the Assistant Registrar

of Co-operative Societies to accept the list of intending members

including the petitioners who intended to become the members

of the Society and thereafter, convene the General Body Meeting

and hold the election to the Managing Committee of the Society.

The said writ petition was disposed of on 25.02.2013.                        In

paragraphs 7 &amp; 8 of the said order, this Court has observed as

under:
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "7.      The Chief Promotor will continue to hold the
      office    till   the    new     Managing         Committee        is
      constituted.          Admittedly,     election     of   the    third
      respondent - Society is not yet conducted. It is not
      shown to me as to what in the legal impediment for
      the Chief Promotor to accept the applications of the
      petitioners and other farmers, if they are otherwise
      qualified to be the members of the Society.                   In the
      instant     case      neither   the    applications       of     the
      petitioners and other farmers are accepted nor
      rejected.        In    the    circumstances,        the       second
                                              WPs.32676-32688/2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                7</span>



respondent      is   to   be    directed   to   consider   the
applications of the petitioners and other farmers in
accordance with law.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">8.     This     Court      in    W.P.No.46350/2012         and
connected matters vide order dated 11.01.2013
directed the third respondent Society and its Election
Officer to hold election within a time frame of two
months from the stage it was stopped.             Petitioners
are not parties to W.P.No.46350/2012 and connected
matters.      Therefore, the time is to be extended to
hold   elections.         In    the   meanwhile   petitioners
representations and others are to be considered in
accordance with law.                Accordingly and for the
reasons stated above the following:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                 ORDER
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">i)     Writ Petitions are hereby disposed of.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">ii)    The Chief Promoter of the third respondent Society
       is hereby directed to consider the request of the
       petitioners and other farmers as per Annexure-A
       within a time frame of thirty days from the date of
       receipt of copy of this order.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">iii)   The time granted to hold election of the third
       respondent Society in Writ Petition No.46350/2012
       is extended by another ten weeks from the date of
                                           WPs.32676-32688/2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              8</span>



            passing an order by the Chief Promotor on the
            application Annexure-A."
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">4.    Thereafter, the Chief Promoter, to whom the direction has

been issued, issued a communication as per Annexure-N on

06.05.2013 in compliance with the direction issued by this

Court on 25.02.2013 in W.P.Nos.2457-2470/2013. In the said

communication, he has made it clear that the petitioners herein

who intended to become the members of the Society could not

be accepted as such members as they had not made any

application along with relevant documents by paying the share

amount. He has further stated in the said communication that

as the High Court had already fixed the time frame to conduct

the election that too from the stage where it was interrupted,

the request made by them for enlisting them as members had

been rejected.    In this background, the petitioners are

challenging Annexure-N communication also.


</p><p id="p_10">5.    The main contention of the learned counsel for the

petitioners is that while enlisting the members for respondent

No.3 - Society, the proper procedure was not followed by the

Chief Promoter, inasmuch as publicity was not given to the

intending members residing in as many as 14 villages.     As a
                                              WPs.32676-32688/2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 9</span>



result, the Chief Promoter had proceeded only to enlist his

followers as members and therefore, the attempt made to

conduct elections with the help of such members was rightly

questioned by the petitioners before this Court and this Court

had given an opportunity to the petitioners to get themselves

enrolled as members making it clear that only thereafter,

elections shall be conducted.        Despite such direction, the

respondents have conducted election as per the calendar of

events published vide Annexure-R and therefore, the entire

process of election gets vitiated.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">6.    It is the further contention of the learned counsel for the

petitioners that it was made clear in the earlier order dated

11.01.2013 passed in W.P.No.46350/2012 and connected cases

by this Court that the election process shall be conducted from

the stage where it was interrupted by rescheduling the dates

and the same was clarified in the decision rendered on

25.02.2013 in W.P.Nos.2457-2470/2013 making it clear that

the Chief Promoter of the respondent - Society had to consider

the request of the petitioners and the other farmers as per their

application within a time frame of 30 days and hence, the time

granted to hold election to the Managing Committee of the 3rd
                                                   WPs.32676-32688/2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                     10</span>



respondent     -      Society   as    per   the   order   passed    in

W.P.No.46350/2012 was extended by another ten weeks.                In

sum and substance, his contention is that if both these orders

passed by this Court are looked into, it becomes very clear that

the Chief Promoter should first consider the applications filed

by the petitioners and other similarly placed applicants and

thereafter, elections shall be held.        Such a procedure is not

followed and hence, the whole process is vitiated.


</p><p id="p_13">7.    The    impleading     applicants in     I.A.2/2013,    who   are

represented by the learned counsel Sri Jaiprakash Reddy, are

the successful members who have been elected unopposed as

members of the Managing Committee of the Society in the

elections held pursuant to the calendar of events issued vide

Annexure-R. Sri Jaiprakash Reddy, learned counsel appearing

for them strongly resisted the claim made by the petitioners in

the writ petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">8.    I.A.4/2013 is filed by the counsel for the petitioners to

implead the remaining successful members who have been

elected unopposed as members of the Managing Committee of

the Society in the elections held pursuant to the calendar of

events issued vide Annexure-R.
</p><p id="p_16">                                                       WPs.32676-32688/2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                      11</span>




</p><p id="p_17">9.      Learned     Additional       Government       Advocate   has    filed

statement of objections and has supported the action of the

authorities in conducting the election. It is his submission that

before the interim order of stay passed in this case was

communicated, the elections had been held, as, after the

withdrawal of the nominations filed by other candidates, only

eight candidates had been left in the fray and these eight

candidates have been declared elected unopposed.


</p><p id="p_18">10.     Upon hearing the learned counsel for the parties and

after considering the pleadings and the respective contentions,

it is not in dispute that elections had been indeed notified to the

respondent - Society earlier by issuing calendar of events on

22.10.2012. The authorities did not hold elections as per the

calendar of events published. This made some of the members

of     the     Society      to   approach      this    Court     by     filing

W.P.No.46350/2012 and other connected cases.                     They had

sought for a direction to continue the election process to the

respondent - Society from the stage where it was interrupted as

per the calendar of events published on 22.10.2012.                    In the

said    writ    petition,    after   hearing   the     learned   Additional

Government Advocate and after noticing his submission, this
                                                    WPs.32676-32688/2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                    12</span>



Court issued a direction to the Assistant Registrar of Co-

operative       Societies,         Chikkaballapur          Sub-Division,

Chikkaballapur, to continue the election process from the stage

where it was interrupted by rescheduling the dates. After this

order     was   passed,      the   petitioners    filed   W.P.Nos.2457-

2470/2013.      They had made allegations against the Chief

Promoter of the respondent - Society stating that without giving

due publicity for enlisting the members by collecting the shares,

the Chief Promoter had proceeded to collect the share amount

from his followers only ignoring the legitimate aspirations of the

other farmers/villagers. Taking note of this grievance, this

Court issued a direction to the Chief Promoter to consider the

request of the petitioners and the other farmers. It is also made

clear that the time granted earlier to hold elections as per the

order dated 11.01.2013 passed in W.P.No.46350/2012 was

extended by another ten weeks.

communication to petitioner No.1 herein rejecting his request

assigning several reasons.         This is followed by the election

process     being   conducted      from   the    stage    where   it   was

interrupted by issuing calendar of events on 06.07.2013. The
                                             WPs.32676-32688/2013

remaining process in the unfinished election process has been

completed and the elections have been declared.


</p><p id="p_21">12.   It is also contended by the counsel for the petitioners that

in view of the amendment to the Karnataka Co-operative

Societies Act by incorporating Section 39AA, the election

conducted by the 4th respondent was without authority of law.

No opinion need be expressed on this legal contention at this

stage as the same can be urged by raising appropriate dispute.


</p><p id="p_22">13.   If the petitioners have any grievance with regard to the

election conducted or with regard to the manner in which their

applications were rejected, then the proper procedure to be

adopted is to raise an election dispute. A writ petition cannot

be a remedy in such a situation. Instead of raising an election

dispute, the petitioners have approached this Court by filing

these writ petitions.   Although these writ petitions are filed

before the election was declared, the fact remains that even

before the interim order of stay could be communicated to the

respondent   - authorities,   the   election results had     been

announced as only eight contestants had been left in the fray

and the other contestants had withdrawn their nominations.

Therefore, it will be futile for this Court to examine the various
                                           WPs.32676-32688/2013
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                               14</span>



contentions urged by the petitioners.   The contentions urged

require examination of the disputed facts as well.   Therefore,

these writ petitions are dismissed reserving liberty to the

petitioners to raise appropriate dispute regarding the election

conducted, if they are so aggrieved.
