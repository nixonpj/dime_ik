                       ALEXANDER THOMAS, J.
                    ==================
              Crl.M.C.Nos.5065, 5066 &amp; 5264 of 2015
                    ==================
              Dated this the 11th day of August, 2015
                              O R D E R
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioners in Crl.M.C.5066/2015 and petitioner in

5264/2015 are accused 1 to 6 in Crime No.911/2015 of

Pooyappally Police Station, Kollam district and the petitioners in

Crl.M.C.No.5065/2015 are accused 1 to 7 in Crime No.912/2015 of

Pooyappally Police Station, Kollam District. The former crime is said

to be the main case in the matter and the latter crime pertains to

the counter case. Both the case and counter case arising out of

certain incidents which occurred during the conduct of a church

procession which was going through the public road and the clash

occurred between the rivals concerned on account of the alleged

taking of photographs of some of the girls who participated in that

rally. These incidents resulted in the registration of the aforestated

crimes. The accused in both these respective crimes have settled the

issues with the respective de facto complainants in those crimes and

the petitioners in these Crl.M.Cs pray that the respective impugned

criminal proceedings may be quashed on the ground of settlement

Crl.M.C.5065/15 etc.               - : 2 :-
</p>
<p id="p_2">arrived at between the respective petitioners/accused and the

respective de facto complainants concerned.            Petitioners in

Crl.M.C.No.5066/2015 are accused 1 to 4 and 6 in Crime

No.911/2015 and petitioners in Crl.M.C.No.5264/2015 is accused

No.5 in Crime No.911/2015, whereas the petitioners in Crl.M.C.No.

5065/2015 are the seven accused in Crime No.912/2015 of

Pooyappally Police Station. In all these cases the respective de facto

complainants concerned have sworn to affidavits stating that the

entire disputes between the petitioners/accused concerned and the

de facto complainants concerned have duly settled and that the

respective de facto complainants have no objection whatsoever to

quash the impugned criminal proceedings. It is in the light of these

aspects that the petitioners have preferred the instant Criminal

Miscellaneous Cases with the prayer to quash the impugned

criminal proceedings against them.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      2.    In a catena of decisions, the Apex Court has held that, in

appropriate cases involving even non-compoundable offences, the

High Court can quash prosecution by exercise of the powers under

Sec.482 of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>., if the parties have really settled the whole

Crl.M.C.5065/15 etc.                    - : 3 :-
</p>
<p id="p_4">dispute or if the continuance of the prosecution will not serve any

purpose. Here, this Court finds a real case of settlement between

the parties and it is also found that continuance of the prosecution

in such a situation will not serve any purpose other than wasting the

precious time of the court, when the case ultimately comes before

the court. On a perusal of the petition and on a close scrutiny of the

investigation materials on record and the affidavit of settlement and

taking into account the attendant facts and circumstances of this

case, this Court is of the considered opinion that the legal principles

laid down by the Apex Court in the cases as in <a href="/doc/69949024/" id="a_2">Gian Singh v. State

of Punjab</a> reported in 2013 (1) SCC (Cri) 160 = (2012) 10 SCC 303

and <a href="/doc/160278245/" id="a_3">Narinder Singh and others v. State of Punjab</a> and anr. reported

in (2014) 6 SCC 466, more particularly paragraph 29 thereof, could

be applied in these cases to consider the prayer for quashment.

Accordingly, it is ordered in the interest of justice that:-

</p><p id="p_5">(i)   In Crl.M.C.No.5066/2015 the impugned Anx.A-1 FIR in Crime No.911/2015
      of Pooyappally Police Station, Kollam district, and all further proceedings
      arising therefrom pending against the petitioners therein stand quashed.

</p><p id="p_6">(ii)  In Crl.M.C.No.5264/2015 the impugned Anx.A-1 FIR in Crime No.911/2015
      of Pooyappally Police Station, Kollam district, and all further proceedings
      arising therefrom pending against the petitioner therein stand quashed.

</p><p id="p_7">(iii) In Crl.M.C.No.5065/2015 the impugned Anx.1 FIR in Crime No.912/2015 of

Crl.M.C.5065/15 etc.                    - : 4 :-

Miscellaneous Cases stand finally disposed of.
