ORAL
ORDER</pre> 

 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_1">Heard
	learned advocate Mr KI Patel for the appellants and learned advocate
	Mr Ashish Shah for the respondents.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_2">This
	Appeal from Order is directed against the order dated 17.11.2007
	passed by the learned Additional Senior Civil Judge, Rajkot below
	applications Exhs. 5 and 13 in Special Civil Suit No. 128 of 2007. 
	Appellants are the original plaintiffs.  They have instituted the
	said suit challenging the sale deed dated 04.08.2007 of agricultural
	land of village Movaiya. They also prayed for interim injunction
	against the defendants.  Defendants, in turn, filed counter
	application contending inter alia that the land was sold to them by
	a registered sale deed and they are in possession thereof.  The
	learned Judge passed the impugned common order disposing of
	applications Exhs. 5 and 13 on 17.11.2007.  Exh.5 application was
	rejected.  Counter injunction in favour of the defendants was
	granted.  Exh.13 application was allowed. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_3">Upon
	perusal of the documents on record as well as upon consideration of
	the contents thereof, it is clear that the appellants herein had put
	the signatures/thumb impressions on the registered sale deed with
	respect to suit land.  They were also present before the Registrar
	when the document was registered.  This aspect has not been
	controverted by the appellants also.  What is, however, stated is
	that they were made to send that document through misrepresentation
	and further that they have not received the sale consideration of
	Rs.9,44,000/- indicated in the sale deed. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_4">When
	the appellants had not disputed their signatures/thumb impressions
	on the sale deed and also do not dispute being present before the
	Registrar when the document was registered for the purpose of
	granting or refusing interim injunction, these were the relevant
	factors which were rightly taken into account by the Court below,
	prima facie, believing that there was a valid registered sale deed
	evidencing sale of the suit land by the appellants in favour of the
	defendants.  The learned Judge also on the basis of the registered
	sale deed as well as other attendant documents and in the
	circumstances found that the respondents  original defendants were
	in possession of the suit land. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_5">To
	both these conclusions, I have no reason to interfere. 
	Particularly, when the appellants do not dispute having signed the
	documents and being present before the Registrar when the same was
	registered, at this stage, it would be difficult to hold that no
	such agreement actually took place or that they stated so in the
	document, the defendants were not put in possession of the suit
	land.  In so far as the Trial Court rejected Exh.5 application of
	the appellants and granted counter injunction to the defendants  
	present respondents is concerned, I find no illegality. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_6">There
	are certain aspects of the matter, however, which cannot be totally
	lost sight of.  The appellants have averred that they are illiterate
	or semi-illiterate persons and were not fully aware about the
	contents of the sale deed. They were made to put the
	signatures/thumb impressions through misrepresentation. More
	importantly and admittedly, the entire sale consideration of
	Rs.9,44,000/- is stated to have been paid in cash.  The appellants
	have put forth the theory that out of poverty, they were required to
	borrow a sum of Rs.3 lacs from the respondents few years back and
	since they could not repay the same, the document in question was
	brought into existence. 
</p>	
	 


	  

<p id="p_7">Considering
	all these aspects of the matter, to avoid multiplicity of
	proceedings and further litigation, while upholding the order under
	challenge, it is directed that the respondents shall not
	transfer, lease, assign the suit land in favour of any other person,
	nor will they part with the possession thereof.  
</p>	
	 


	
	  


<p id="p_8">	Subject
	to above condition, the appeal is dismissed.  In view of dismissal
	of appeal, Civil Application No. 15307 of 207 does not survive and
	is disposed of accordingly. 
</p>
