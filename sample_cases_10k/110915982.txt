     The prayer in the present petition is for quashing of the

selection process in pursuance to the advertisement (Annex.1)

which is of the year 1998.

<p id="p_9">     No explanation for the delay is forthcoming.

<p id="p_10">     The Apex Court in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh &amp;

ors. Vs. Arvind Kumar Srivastava &amp; ors. (Civil Appeal No.

9849 of 2014) decided on 17.10.2014 while dealing with the
                                (2 of 3)
                                                           [CW-11047/2012]

question of delay and latches held that in such like cases, the

Court should be very slow in granting the relief to the incumbent

specially when the claimants lost time and did not rise to the

occasion in time for filing the writ petitions and after taking into

account the well settled proposition of law held thus :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "(23) The legal principles which emerge from the
      reading of the aforesaid judgments, cited both by the
      appellants as well as the respondents, can be
      summed up as under:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      (1) Normal rule is that when a particular set of
      employees is given relief by the Court, all other
      identically situated persons need to be treated alike
      by extending that benefit. Not doing so would
      amount to discrimination and would be violative of
      <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. This principle
      needs to be applied in service matters more
      emphatically as the service jurisprudence evolved by
      this Court from time to time postulates that all
      similarly situated persons should be treated similarly.
      Therefore, the normal rule would be that merely
      because other similarly situated persons did not
      approach the Court earlier, they are not to be treated
      differently.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (2) However, this principle is subject to well
      recognized exceptions in the form of laches and
      delays as well as acquiescence. Those persons who
      did not challenge the wrongful action in their cases
      and acquiesced into the same and woke up after long
      delay only because of the reason that their
      counterparts who had approached the Court earlier
      in time succeeded in their efforts, then such
      employees cannot claim that the benefit of the
      judgment rendered in the case of similarly situated
      persons be extended to them. They would be treated
      as fence-sitters and laches and delays, and/or the
      acquiescence, would be a valid ground to dismiss
      their claim."</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">     Similarly, the observations of the Single Bench of the

Calcutta High Court in the case of Mithi Mukherjee Vs. State of

West Bengal and ors. (W.P. No. 14028 of 2013) and other
                                     (3 of 3)
                                                             [CW-11047/2012]

connected petitions decided on 20.01.2014 are most relevant

:-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">           "The inviolable conclusion deducible from the above
           noted decisions are that the stale and dead claims
           should not be encouraged in exercise of the
           discretionary relief under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the
           Constitution of India. A line of distinction is to be
           drawn between a vigilant and a non-vigilant litigant
           and they cannot be equated on the same footing. A
           litigant who was sitting on a fence and waiting for
           the result of the litigation initiated by other litigant
           promptly and after the favourable result approaches
           the Court to seek equality, should not be
           encouraged. Delay and latches is one of the
           important factor to push away the recalcitrant or
           invoible litigant who was watching the proceeding of
           the other and ventilated the grievance only after a
           favourable decision is obtained by the other litigant.
           The plea of inordinate delay is not applicable in case
           of an infringement of the fundamental rights. The
           proceeding may attract dismissal, more so, when a
           third parties' right are created in interregnum. It is
           not an inflexible rule but depends upon the rational
           and satisfactory explanation and, therefore, varies
           from case to case."</blockquote>


<p id="p_12">       The petitioner has challenged the recruitment process after

an inordinate delay of 12 years and that too after he was not

found successful. He got 74.892% marks in the merit, whereas,

the cut-off marks were 84.77%.
</p>
<p id="p_13">       In view of the above, the writ petition is dismissed.
</p>
