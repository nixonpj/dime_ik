    (Smt. Indu Sharma Vs.Secretary, STA, M.P. &amp; Another)
14/10/2014
      Shri Jitendra Sharma, Advocate for the petitioner.
      Heard.
      This petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India is
directed against the order dated 17/12/2013; by which the revision
petition No. 476/2011 under <a href="/doc/1890426/" id="a_2">Section 90</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act
has been rejected by State Transport Appellate Tribunal, Madhya
Pradesh, Gwalior.
      Facts</pre><p id="p_1"> necessary for disposal of writ petition are to the effect
that route Orai to Bhind is an interstate route in respect whereof,
there is a reciprocal agreement between the State of Madhya
Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh duly published in the official gazette
dated 21/11/2006. The present route finds place at Sr. No. 9 in
Schedule 'A' of the said reciprocal agreement. Total length of the
route is 98 kms, out of which 55 kms lies in State of Madhya
Pradesh. As per the aforesaid reciprocal agreement, 12 trips and 6
permits have been allotted to each State for operating the route by
their nominees. As per clause No. 4 (16) of the said agreement, a
permit holder has to apply within 15 days from the date of grant of
permit/renewal of permit for counter signature, otherwise the
permit shall be cancelled. The State Transport Appellate Authority,
Uttar Pradesh granted permit No. 1/STA/Stage-11 in favour of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> 2                       W.P.No. 5694/2014</span>

respondent No. 2 permitting him to operate the bus single trip daily
on the said route from Orai to Bhind. As per the reciprocal
agreement, respondent No. 2 was required to submit an application
for counter signature before the authority of State of M.P. in terms
of Clause 4(16) of aforesaid reciprocal agreement within 15 days
from the date of grant of permit i.e. 31/1/2011. Respondent No. 2
on 23/4/2011 has submitted his application for counter signature
before respondent No. 1 alongwith letter of recommendation issued
by Secretary, STA, Uttar Pradesh.
</p><p id="p_2">      Petitioner's husband Shri Manikchand Sharma, who was
holding the permit No. 532/151/STA/Stage/96 to operate bus on
the interstate route of Orai to Bhind via Mihona issued by State
Transport Authority and duly counter singed by respondent No. 1
Secretary, STA has raised an objection to the same on the ground
of delay in applying for counter signature. After death of husband,
petitioner as a legal heir is operating the said bus. This objection
was rejected after hearing the petitioner and taking into
consideration material placed on record vide order dated 24/7/2011
granting counter signature on the permit applied by respondent no.
</p><p id="p_3">2. being aggrieved thereof, the petitioner has preferred a review
petition before the appellate Tribunal. The appellate Tribunal
though has found the review petition barred by time, however,
condoning the delay it dealt with the objections as raised on merits
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> 3                        W.P.No. 5694/2014</span>

and vide impugned order has rejected the review petition of the
petitioner.
</p><p id="p_4">      Learned counsel for the petitioner has confined his
arguments to the aforesaid rejection of objection as regards counter
singature being appended after prescribed limitation of 15 days.
</p><p id="p_5">      Tribunal has rejected the objection inter alia holding that the
provision as contained in reciprocal agreement cannot be read
independent of the provisions as contained in the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_3">Motor Vehicle
Act</a> which is framed by way of reciprocal agreement           for the
purposes of giving effect to said provisions of <a href="/doc/1935444/" id="a_4">Section 88</a> of Motor
Vehicle Act.
</p><p id="p_6">      Heard.
</p><p id="p_7">      Having gone through the averments made in the petition and
submissions advance, it appears that the permit granted to
respondent No. 2 is in fact pursuant to the interstate reciprocal
transport agreement between two States by Transport Authority,
State of Uttar Pradesh. The permit is in operation for plying of bus
on the aforesaid route. Clause 4 (16) of the said agreement in fact
is regulatory in nature, and therefore, same cannot be construed
strictly by applying strict literal   interpretations. Moreover, the
requirement of counter signature is to help facilitate of regulation
of plying of buses for the public at large. Mere delay in submission
of application for counter signature in the instant case, under such
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">         4                        W.P.No. 5694/2014</span>

        circumstances cannot therefore, resultantly, render requirement of
        counter signature under <a href="/doc/1935444/" id="a_5">Section 88</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_6">Motor Vehicles Act</a>
        otiose. Clause as contained in Clause 4 (16) is to give purposive
        interpretation being regulatory in nature which is intended for
        fulfillment of requirement of <a href="/doc/1935444/" id="a_7">Section 88</a> of Motor Vehicles Act.
        Mere delay in seeking counter signature by itself cannot justify
        denial of the right of plying of buses by virtue of permit granted
        by State Transport Authority. Consequently, the revision petition is
        bereft of merits, same is therefore, dismissed.
