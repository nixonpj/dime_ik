challenged before the Divisional Commissioner, Aurangabad

in Case No. ROR/REV/216/2018 by the petitioner and by

order       dated          15.06.2018,          the        Additional            Divisional

Commissioner, Aurangabad set aside the said order of the

Tahsildar of sealing the stone-crusher of the petitioner,

as   per      order        Exh."G".       As    such,       according           to     learned

question of starting stone-crusher in the odd time, as

mentioned in communication dated 04.05.2019 (Exh."J") of

the Tahsildar, as the petitioner is continuously running

stone-crusher.              According          to    learned        Counsel,           in      the

notice Exh."J", the Tahsildar has informed the Executive

Engineer to stop the electric supply of the stone-crusher
