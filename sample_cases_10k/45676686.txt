					ORDER		
</pre><p id="p_1">	The petitioner has filed the transfer petition seeking the transfer of HMOP No.113 of 2016 pending on the file of the Sub-Court, Kancheepuram to the District Court, Kancheepuram.
</p>

<p id="p_2">	2.From the materials placed on record, it is seen that as per the case of the petitioner, the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent had been conducted even before they had attained majority on 18.02.2008 and accordingly, seeking annulment of the said marriage, it is found that the suit in O.S.No.160 of 2009 had been laid by the petitioner on the file of the District Munsif Court, Kancheepuram.  It is seen that the said plaint had been returned by the concerned Court for presentation before the proper Court stating that the concerned Court is not the competent Court.  The said order is found to have been passed by the District Munsif Court, Kancheepuram on 01.02.2012.  Following the same, it is found that the petitioner has laid the proceeding against the respondent in HMOP No.99 of 2013 on the file of the Sub-Court, Tambaram for dissolving the marriage between the petitioner and respondent.  As could be seen from the materials placed on record, the abovesaid petition is found to have been levied in the month of February, 2013.  The respondent is contesting the abovesaid proceeding by way of  filing a counter. Further, it is also found that at the instance of the respondent, the abovesaid proceeding had been transferred from the file of the Sub-Court, Tambaram to the file of the Sub-Court, Kancheepuram as per the order dated 07.09.2015 in Tr.CMP.No.616 of 2014 of this Court. Seeking the transfer of the abovesaid proceeding to the file of the District Court, Kancheepuram, the present petition has come to be laid by the petitioner. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3.The only ground that has been focused by the petitioner for seeking the transfer is that inasmuch as the marriage between the parties had been performed during their minority and as according to the petitioner, the said marriage is voidable at the option of a contracting party, who was a child, at the time of the marriage, according to the petitioner, as per the <a href="/doc/1321422/" id="a_1">Section 3(1)</a> of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, a petition for annulling a child marriage by a decree  of nullity should be filed in the District Court only by a contracting party, who was child at the time of marriage, on that premise, seeking transfer of the proceeding from the Sub-Court, Kancheepuram to the District Court, Kancheepuram, the present transfer petition has come to be laid by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	4.No doubt, as per the proviso appended to <a href="/doc/1321422/" id="a_2">Section 3(1)</a> of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, a petition for annulling a child marriage by a decree of nullity may be filed in the district Court only by a contracting party to the marriage who was a child at the time of marriage.  As per the case of the petitioner, as could be seen from the materials placed on record, the cause of action for laying the proceeding at Tambaram Sub-Court is stated to be that the marriage held between the petitioner and the respondent had been conducted at Pallavaram on 18.02.2008 accordingly, also contended that the marriage reception was also conducted at Pallavaram and subsequently, the petitioner and the respondent were living separately also at Pallavaram and also contending that the residence of the petitioner is also at Pallavaram, accordingly, putting forth a case that the HMOP No. 99 of 2013 laid by him falls within the jurisdiction of Tambaram Court, accordingly, had laid the abovesaid proceeding before the concerned Court.  However, now contending that as per proviso appended to <a href="/doc/1321422/" id="a_3">Section 3(1)</a> of the abovesaid Act only the District Court, Kancheepuram would be having the jurisdiction, accordingly, has come forward with the present transfer petition.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	5.However, the abovesaid request as such cannot be readily countenanced.  <a href="/doc/40808/" id="a_4">Section 2</a> (e) of the <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_5">Prohibition of Child Marriage Act</a>, 2006 defines District Court as follows:
</p><p id="p_6">	(e). district court means, in any area for which a Family Court established under <a href="/doc/762240/" id="a_6">section 3</a> of the Family Courts Act, 1984 (66 of 1984) exists, such Family Court, and in any area for which there is no Family Court but a city civil court exists, that court and in any other area, the principal civil court of original jurisdiction and includes any other civil court which may be specified by the State Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, as having jurisdiction in respect of the matters dealt with in this Act;
	Therefore, as per the abovesaid definition, it is found that the district Court need not be the Principal Civil Court of the original jurisdiction as sought to be projected by the petitioner and from the abovesaid definition, it could be seen that the District Court would also mean and include a family Court, if any such family Court is established as per the <a href="/doc/373687/" id="a_7">Family Courts Act</a>, 1984, in the area concerned or where such family Court is not in existence but a Civil Court exists, that Civil Court would be having the jurisdiction and in any other area, the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction could be having the jurisdiction and the definition also would further state that the jurisdiction could also be extended to the other Civil Court, which may be specified by the State Government, by notification in the Offical gazette, as having jurisdiction in respect of the matters dealt with in the said Act.   Accordingly, it is seen that as sought to be projected by the petitioner, the District Court, Kancheepuram alone would not have the exclusive jurisdiction to try the proceeding.  <a href="/doc/902105/" id="a_8">Section 8</a> of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 reads as follows:
</p><p id="p_7">8.Court to which petition should be made.-
</p><p id="p_8">	For the purpose of grant of reliefs under <a href="/doc/1422776/" id="a_9">sections 3</a>, <a href="/doc/1934162/" id="a_10">4</a> and <a href="/doc/559904/" id="a_11">5</a>, the district court having jurisdiction shall include the district court having jurisdiction over the place where the defendant or the child resides, or where the marriage was solemnised or where the parties last resided together or the petitioner is residing on the date of presentation of the petition.

</p><p id="p_9">	6.Accordingly, it is found that for seeking the reliefs provided under <a href="/doc/1422776/" id="a_12">Sections 3</a>, <a href="/doc/1934162/" id="a_13">4</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/559904/" id="a_14">5</a> of the abovesaid Act, the District Court having jurisdiction shall include the District Court having jurisdiction over the place, where the defendant or the child resides or where the marriage was solemnised or where the parties last resided together or the petitioner is residing on the date of presentation of the petition.  As abovenoted, according to the petitioner, the alleged marriage took place at Pallavaram and both the parties thereafter also resided separately at Pallavaram and accordingly, he has averred in the OP filed at Sub-Court, Tambaram that the Sub-Court is having the jurisdiction to entertain the petition as per the definition of the District Court contemplated under <a href="/doc/1936208/" id="a_15">Section 2(e)</a> of the abovesaid Act. As abovenoted, it is found that where the family Court is not in existence in the concerned area, the civil Court, which exists in the said area would be having the jurisdiction and in any other area, the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction would be having the jurisdiction. Accordingly, when it is seen that as per the case of the petitioner himself, the cause of action arose at Pallavaram, it is found that the Civil Court at Tambaram would have the jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding laid by the petitioner and accordingly, it is found that the Sub-Court at Tambaram had also entertained the petition laid by the petitioner to dissolve the marriage between the parties.  In such view of the matter, the contention putforth by the petitioner that it is only the District Court, Kancheepuram, which would have the jurisdiction and not the Sub-Court, Tambaram as such cannot be readily accepted.  On a reading of the definition of the District Court contained in <a href="/doc/1936208/" id="a_16">Section 2(e)</a> of the abovesaid Act, it is found that the Sub-Court, Tambaram, would also be having the jurisdiction in the absence of the family Court at Tambaram and when the cause of action for the lis is said to have been taken place at Pallavaram and accordingly, the Sub-Court, Tambaram, being the Civil Court existing in the said area, accordingly, it is seen that the Sub-Court, Tambaram would have the jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding.
</p>	
<p id="p_10">	7.As above seen, when the proceeding had been ordered to be transferred to Sub-Court, Kancheepuram as per the order of this Court, the same cannot be stifled by the petitioner by seeking another transfer to the District Court, Kancheepuram on the point of jurisdiction in particular, when the petitioner has failed to establish that the District Court, Kancheepuram would have the exclusive jurisdiction to entertain the matter.
</p>



<p id="p_11">	For the reasons aforestated, the Transfer Civil Miscellaneous Petition is dismissed. Consequently, connected CMP.No.12201 of 2018 is also dismissed. </p><pre id="pre_2">
