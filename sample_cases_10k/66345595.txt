                                  -:1:-
                      SUIT FOR RECOVERY OF RS. 42,900/-
JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">  1. The present suit has been filed by the plaintiff seeking recovery of Rs. 42,900/-
     against the defendant.
</p>

<p id="p_2">  2. It has been stated that the plaintiff is a registered firm and dealing in supply of
     boxes, poly bag, seat trading etc. It is submitted that the defendant was
     engaged in selling of the said items. The defendant approached the plaintiff
     firm for the supply of packing material and signed the agreement with the
     plaintiff. It is submitted that the plaintiff firm started supplying the aforesaid
     material to the defendant firm and the defendant firm issued receipts and
     executed bills of the said materials. It was clearly mentioned on the bills that in
     default of payment interest @ 24% p.a will be charged from the defendant firm.
</p>

<p id="p_3">  3. Further, it is submitted that the last bill was given by the plaintiff to the
     defendant for a sum for Rs. 2255.50/- on 22.11.2006. It is submitted a total
     sum of Rs. 42,900/- along with interest is due which is recoverable from the
     defendant firm. Thereafter, plaintiff served a legal notice dt. 27.03.2007 to the
     defendant. Hence, the present suit.
</p>

<p id="p_4">  4. Defendant has filed a detailed WS stating that the suit of the plaintiff is not
     maintainable as the constitution of the plaintiff is not clear. It is submitted that
     the suit has not been filed and instituted by a duly authorized person. It is
     submitted that the present suit has been filed by the plaintiff without any cause
     of action and the defendant has made payment of all the bills raised by the
     plaintiff.

<p id="p_5"> 5. Replication was filed reiterating the facts of the plaint and denying the contents
   of the WS. On the basis of the pleadings following issues were framed on
   29.09.2010 which are as follows:-
</p>

<p id="p_6">   1      Whether the suit is not maintainable in its present form, as alleged?OPD
   2      Whether the suit has been filed and instituted by duly authorized
          person?OPP
   3      Whether the plaintiff is entitled for recovery of an amount of Rs.</p><pre id="pre_2">
          42,900/-, as prayed?IOPP
   4      Whether the plaintiff is entitled for any pendentlite and future interest, if
          yes, at what rate and for which period?OPP
   5      Relief.




</pre><p id="p_7">6. In PE, plaintiff examined Director of the plaintiff as PW-1 and tendered
   documents i.e. Ex. PW-1/1 to Ex. PW-1/4. Ex. PW-1/1 is the partnership deed,
   Ex. PW-1/2 is bill cum agreement, Ex. PW-1/3 is the legal notice and Ex.
   PW-1/4 is the receipt. On the other hand and employee of the defendant
   company deposed as DW-1.
</p>

<p id="p_8">7. Final Arguments were advanced by both the parties. I have perused the record
   and considered the arguments carefully and my issue-wise findings are as
   follows:-
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">   Issue Nos.1, 2, 3 &amp; 4</span>


<p id="p_9">   1      Whether the suit is not maintainable in its present form, as
          alleged?OPD



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                       -:3:-</span>
    2         Whether the suit has been filed and instituted by duly authorized
             person?OPP

   3         Whether the plaintiff is entitled for recovery of an amount of Rs.
</p><p id="p_10">             42,900/-, as prayed?OPP

   4         Whether the plaintiff is entitled for any pendentlite and future
             interest, if yes, at what rate and for which period?OPP

</p><p id="p_11">8. The factual matrix governing all these issues is the same and thus, the issues
   have been considered together.
</p>

<p id="p_12">9. As per plaint, it is case of the plaintiff that the plaintiff is a registered firm and
   the suit has been instituted by its Director, Ms.Neetu Singh. On the contrary, in
   the affidavit filed in evidence on behalf of the plaintiff, the same Ms.Neetu
   Singh has deposed as PW-1 and disclosed herself as proprietor/partner of the
   plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_13">10. In further contradiction of the above stated facts, the PW-1 has relied upon
   Ex.PW-1/1 i.e. a partnership deed of the plaintiff firm. The said deed clearly
   provides that the plaintiff is a partnership firm and Ms.Neetu Singh is one of
   the two partners. The said Ex.PW-1/1 does not disclose that the partnership is
   a registered one. Further, PW-1 has admitted during her cross examination
   that the plaintiff firm is not registered which contradicts the stand taken in the
   plaint.
</p>

<p id="p_14">11. <a href="/doc/797638/" id="a_1">Section 69</a> of Indian Partnership Act, 1932 specifically bars a suit to enforce
   any contractual right against a third party if the partnership firm is not
   registered. In the present suit, the plaintiff, which is an unregistered
   partnership firm, is trying to enforce recovery of money arising out of
   contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. The said act of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                        -:4:-</span>
    the plaintiff is barred under S.69 of Partnership Act as the plaintiff firm is not
   registered. Thus, the plaintiff is barred from instituting the present suit and the
   suit is not maintainable in its present form and is liable to be dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_15">12. In addition to the aforesaid, it is clear that the person who has instituted the
   suit on behalf of the plaintiff and has deposed in evidence as PW-1 was not
   even aware about the legal character of the plaintiff. The plaint or the affidavit
   in evidence does not disclose any resolution or authorization in favour of
   Ms.Neetu Singh to institute the present suit or to depose as witness on behalf
   of the plaintiff. As the person instituting the suit was not competent to do the
   said act, the suit is liable to be dismissed on this ground alone.
</p>

<p id="p_16">13. In the absence of any specific authorization to depose on behalf of plaintiff, the
   evidence led by PW-1 has no sanctity and cannot be read in evidence. Further,
   in absence of any evidence on the part of the plaintiff, the case of the plaintiff
   falls flat and is liable to be dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_17">14. Even if the aforesaid observations are kept aside for the sake of arguing the
   case of the plaintiff on its merits, it is evident that the plaintiff has utterly failed
   to establish its case by way of evidence.
</p>

<p id="p_18">15. The plaintiff has claimed that the suit of recovery is based upon various bills,
   however there is no description of the said bills in the plaint or the affidavit in
   evidence. The plaintiff has only disclosed one bill for Rs.2255.50/- dt.
   22.11.2006. The said bill does not give any indication of the amount of Rs.
   42,900/- claimed by the plaintiff or the extra amount of Rs.40000/- which is not
   reflected in the bill.
</p>

<p id="p_19">16. The plaintiff has not placed on record any statement of account maintained by

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                         -:5:-</span>
         the plaintiff in the usual course of business which could disclose the liability of
        the defendant towards the goods supplied by the plaintiff. It is the case of the
        plaintiff that the goods were supplied to the defendant a number of times
        during their business and therefore, it can be assumed that the account
        between the parties was a current, mutual and running account. In such cases,
        the claim is always based upon the amount disclosed by the statement of
        account rather than the individual bills. The PW-1 has admitted that the plaintiff
        is managing such a statement of account. However, the absence of the same
        has remained entirely unexplained.
</p>

<p id="p_20">  17. Thus, in sum total, the plaintiff has utterly failed to disclose any rationale for
        the amount claimed by the plaintiff. Evidently, the deposition of the defendant
        is also suffering from a number of discrepancies, however, it is settled law that
        the case of the plaintiff has to stand on its own feet and cannot take support in
        the shortcomings of the defense.
</p>

<p id="p_21">  18. From the aforesaid facts, it is clear that the present suit is not maintainable
        under law, has not been filed by a competent and authorized person and does
        not disclose the cause of action on which the suit has been filed. Thus, the
        issue nos.1 to 4 are decided in favour of the defendant and against the
        plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_22">        Issue No.5
        Relief
                 In view of the aforesaid, the suit of the plaintiff stands dismissed with
        costs. Decree sheet be prepared accordingly. File be consigned to record
room.
