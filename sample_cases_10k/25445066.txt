<p id="p_2">         2.   Perused the record. The applicant has prayed
         to    modify         the     order           dated       14.9.2006,                  more

         ordinate Bench has, as back as on 14.9.2006 i.e.
         10 years back, imposed a condition 4 (d) upon the
         present applicant that he shall mark his presence
         before the concerned police station between 1st
         to 10th of every month between 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.
         The applicant has also prayed to delete condition

                R/CR.MA/25442/2016                                                    ORDER




         4 (e) whereby applicant is restricted to leave
         the State of Gujarat without prior permission of
         the Sessions Judge concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_3">         3.   It is undisputed fact that applicant has been
         charged     u/ss.363,          366           and        376        of       the         <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>.
         However, by impugned judgment dated 7.6.2006 in
         Sessions       Case         No.239           of       2005,            though                the
         applicant       has         been     convicted                for         committing
         offences     u/ss.363         and       366        of      the       <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>,         he         was
         acquitted from the charge u/s.376 of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a>. It
         is   also      undisputed             fact          that          there           is         no
         complaint about non-compliance of such order for
         last 10 years and therefore, I do not see any
         reason to continue with such condition after long
         period of 10 years, so also considering the fact
         that otherwise also applicant is not a hardcore
         criminal so as to confirm his presence before the
         investigating agency every month.
</p>
<p id="p_4">         4.   Whereas, learned APP has submitted that since
         such condition is there since a decade, there is
         no   reason       to       delete       any         of       such         condition.
         Whereas,      so       far     as       condition                 No.4          (d)          is
         concerned, it is submitted that if instead of
         deleting     such          condition,         the         applicant              may         be
         restricted from travelling beyond India.
</p>
<p id="p_5">         5.   However, there is no reason to continue the
         condition No.4 (d) regarding marking of presence
         of   the    applicant          before             the      concerned               police
         station on every month, considering the fact that

         he has marked his presence for last 10 years, and
         that as aforesaid, he is not a hardcore criminal,
         whose presence is required to be confirmed before
         the police.
</p>
<p id="p_6">         6.      In view of above facts and circumstances, the
         application            is     partly      allowed.             Thereby,             though
         condition No.4 (d) of order dated 14.9.2006 is
         deleted, condition No.4 (e) is modified, whereby,
         instead of restricting the applicant to travel
         outside Gujarat, the applicant shall not travel
         beyond       India          without      prior          permission                of          the
         Sessions Judge concerned.

         extent. Direct service is permitted.
