     CORAM: HONOURABLE JUSTICE SMT. ANJANA MISHRA
     ORAL JUDGMENT
      Date : 13-09-2019
                   Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the

     learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State.

</p><p id="p_10">                  2. The petitioner seeks to quash the order dated

     17.05.2019 passed in Misc. Appeal No.8 of 2016 by the District &amp;

     Sessions Judge, Siwan, whereby the miscellaneous appeal filed

     along with an application for condonation of delay for inclusion of

     the name of saw mill of the petitioner in the Seniority List for

     Siwan District prepared in the light of Resolution No.2675 dated

     30.08.2010, has been rejected on the premise that the petitioner

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            2/4</span>




       had filed the said application after a delay of thirty days as

       prescribed under the law.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                    3. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that

       the petitioner also prays for setting aside the order dated

       13.08.2013 passed in Appeal No.12 of 2012 by Respondent No.5,

       which was the order impugned in the writ application (C.W.J.C.

       No.20926 of 2013) filed earlier by the petitioner before this Court

       and in which a direction has been issued to the petitioner to appear

       before the appropriate forum and which was disposed of on

       08.02.2016 in the following terms :

                                learned counsel for the petitioner and learned AC
                                to SC-19.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                             Learned counsel for the petitioner
                                tried to persuade the Court to quash an order
                                dated 13.08.2013 passed in Appeal no.12 of 2012
                                (Annexure-7 to the writ petition). However, after
                                noticing the fact that the Court was not inclined to
                                directly interfere with the matter, learned counsel
                                for the petitioner makes a prayer for disposal of
                                the writ petition, so that the petitioner may avail
                                appropriate remedy.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                             The prayer is allowed.

</p><p id="p_13">                                             It goes without saying that the period
                                consumed in pursuing the present writ petition i.e.
                                from 19.10.2013 till date, may be excluded, while
                                considering the limitation matter. It is also
 Patna High Court CWJC No.18807 of 2019 dt.13-09-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           3/4</span>




                                observed that the Court has not recorded any
                                opinion on the merit of the case."
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">                    4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that after

       the disposal of the aforementioned writ application in which

       liberty had been extended to the petitioner to approach the

       appropriate forum for redressal of his grievance, the petitioner

       filed an application along with an application for condonation of

       delay, but the learned District &amp; Sessions Judge, Siwan without

       appreciating the case of the petitioner and without even glancing

       through the limitation petition, which was filed along with the said

       application, rejected the case of the petitioner, vide his order dated

       17.05.2019. Learned counsel for the petitioner thus submits that

       there has been clear miscarriage of justice and the petitioner's case

       deserves to be considered in the light of the relevant provisions of

       law.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                    5. Learned counsel for the State submits that the sole

       ground on which the case of the petitioner was rejected is non-

       observance of the mandates of law which provides that even such

       appeal be filed before the District Judge within a period of thirty

       days and not otherwise.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                    6. After hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner

       and the learned counsel for the State, it appears that in the present

       case, the order dated 17.05.2019 does not indicate any
              Patna High Court CWJC No.18807 of 2019 dt.13-09-2019
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                        4/4</span>




                    consideration of the limitation petition which was annexed with

                    the miscellaneous appeal and without considering the same, the

                    learned District &amp; Sessions Judge has proceeded to dispose of the

                    appeal of the petitioner rejecting his case in toto.

</p><p id="p_18">                                 7. After consideration of all facts and circumstances, the

                    matter is remanded back to the learned District &amp; Sessions Judge,

                    Siwan for re-consideration of the case of the petitioner in the light

                    of the relevant provisions of law and after consideration of the fact

                    that the petitioner had filed the case about two months of the date

                    of the disposal of the writ application filed before this Court

                    earlier. The court shall take into consideration the explanation

                    offered by the petitioner while considering the application for

                    condonation of delay and thereafter proceed to decide the matter in

                    its entirety on merits after due consideration of the relevant

                    provisions of law within a period of three months from the date of

                    receipt/production of a copy of this judgment/order.

</p><p id="p_19">                                 8. The application thus stands disposed of.</p><pre id="pre_2">
