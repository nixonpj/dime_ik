                        W.P.(C).No.26492 of 2014
                  ----------------------------------------------------
             Dated this the 21st day of January,2015

</pre><p id="p_1">                             -----------------------
</p>
<p id="p_2">      A short question that falls for consideration is whether an

employee working other than the State Government service in

Kerala has to submit an application in the 'Form of Receipt' as

contemplated in condition No.20 in Part-II General Condition

notification of the Kerala Public Service Commission (for short the

P.S.C.)   The petitioner has appeared for the written test and

interview pursuant to the notification issued by the PSC for the

posts of Junior Assistant/Cashier/Assistant Grade II/Clerk Grade

I/Time Keeper Grade II/Senior Assistant/Assistant/Junior Clerk etc.

under various public undertakings and Corporations under the

Government of Kerala. On verification, it is found that the 'Form of

Receipt' produced by the petitioner is defective as it is not in

conformity with the general conditions. Therefore, the petitioner

is not included in the final rank list published by the PSC for the

above recruitment.
</p>
<p id="p_3">W.P.(C).No.26492 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                      2</span>


</p><p id="p_4">      2.     The petitioner's case is that he is working as Security

Assistant in the Bureau of Immigration, Government of India. It is

further submits that 'Form of Receipt' is only meant for the

employees working in the Government services in Kerala and the

petitioner having produced consent in terms of Note-2 under the

Condition No.20 satisfies the procedure for consent for considering

him for selection.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      3.    The 'Form of Receipt' as contemplated under Condition

No.20 is a requisite form for a Government servant, who is applying

for post notified under PSC in general Condition No.20 which

stipulates as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_6">   "When a Government Servant is applying for a post notified by the

   Kerala Public Service Commission:-
</p>
<p id="p_7">   A  Government Servant       employed in a      Service  under the

   Administrative Control of the Government of Kerala applying for a

   post in another Office or Department of the Government of Kerala

   shall obtain a receipt in the following form at the time of applying

   for the post from the Head of Office and shall produce the same to

   the Commission as and when called for."
</p>
<p id="p_8">W.P.(C).No.26492 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 3</span>


</p><p id="p_9">      4.    The object of the above condition is that an employee

who is in the service of Government of Kerala shall obtain the

consent from the Head of Office for applying for any post. It is

specifically indicates that 'Form of Receipt' as referred in the

above, has to be submitted by any candidate who is under the

service of Government of Kerala applying for the post under the

Administrative Control of the Government of Kerala. This is also

discernable from Note-2, wherein a different procedure has been

prescribed for the employees under the Government of India or

other State Government. Note-2 stipulates that application should

be forwarded through proper channel with necessary endorsement

to the effect that the application has been made in accordance

with the Rules made by the Government concerned.          It further

stipulates that consent of the Government concerned will be

insisted upon, if the application is not forwarded properly. So as

far as Note-2 is concerned, that would only apply to any candidates,

who are employed other than with the Government of Kerala. PSC

W.P.(C).No.26492 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4</span>


has no case that Note-2 would also apply to the employees under

the Government of Kerala. Therefore, it is clear that Note-2 is only

applicable for the Government employees working either under the

Government of India or any other State.       Therefore, PSC cannot

insist that the petitioner being an employee under the Government

of India, to obtain a 'Form of Receipt' as prescribed in Condition

No.20 in the same format, as the same is only applicable to

employees under the Government of Kerala. However the question

arises that whether the petitioner has obtained a consent in terms

of Note 2. It is admitted that now the application by the candidates

need not be routed through the Head of the Department. On the

other hand, the application is made through the online. Therefore,

it is not possible to forward the application through proper channel

and that part of the Note 2 has become now redundant in the sense

that no application can be made through the Head of the

Department. Now the question is whether the petitioner had

complied the requirement of the consent which can be insisted by

W.P.(C).No.26492 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 5</span>


the PSC for considering the petitioner for selection.    It is to be

noted that Note 2 clearly indicates that consent of the Government

concerned will be insisted upon, if the application is not forwarded

properly.  Therefore, it is always open for the PSC to insist the

consent from the employer to be produced by the candidate, if he

is employed under the Government of India or other State

Government. There is no prescribed format for consent perhaps it

was for that reason Note-2 initial part insist upon submission of an

application through proper channel. The petitioner submits that he

had already submitted a consent as per Exts.P3 and P6.

</p><p id="p_10">     5.    The learned Standing counsel for PSC would submit that

Exts.P3 and P6 would not indicate that any consent has been

obtained by the petitioner.     On the other hand, it is only a

permission granted for appearing the examination.       PSC in fact

rejected the petitioner's application for want of 'Form of receipt'

and not for want of consent. Since the rejection is only on the

ground of non-production of 'Form of Receipt' which cannot be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  6</span>


insisted upon the employees who is working under the Government

of India, I am of the view that an opportunity should be given to the

petitioner to produce the consent. As rightly pointed out by the

learned Standing Counsel for the PSC that Exts.P3 and P6 do not

reflect the consent of the employer.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      6.    In this matter a statement has been filed by the

Assistant Solicitor General on behalf of the 3rd respondent.

Paragraph 11 of the statement reads as follows:

</p><p id="p_12">      "As stated above, and since it is revealed now that the Form

of Receipt under question has actually been prescribed by the KPSC,

there is no impediment for the Bureau of Immigration in issuing the

same, it is still required by the KPSC or if the Hon'ble Court so

directs"
</p>
<p id="p_13">       The Bureau of Immigration has no impediment in issuing

consent in terms of form of receipt. In view of the above, the 3rd

respondent is directed to issue a consent letter to the petitioner

within a period of four weeks. If the petitioner produces the

consent, within further period of four weeks, the petitioner shall be

included in the rank list and a suitable ranking shall be assigned to

the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_14">           The writ petition is disposed of as above. No costs.
