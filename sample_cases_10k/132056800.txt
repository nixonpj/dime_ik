                        Cr. Misc. No. 56218 of 2007
              Ramjee Prasad Vrs. The State of Bihar &amp; Anr.
                                   ****
</pre>
<p id="p_1">/7/   01.05.2008            By order, dated 23.01.2008, provisional anticipatory bail

                   was granted to petitioner, Ramjee Prasad, opposite party no. 2,

                   who is complainant and wife of the petitioner was noticed for her

                   appearance. On 16.04.2008, the matter was listed in chambers.

                   The petitioner as well as opposite party no. 2 were physically

                   present. The petitioner expressed his willingness to take his wife,

                   Neelam Devi, opposite party no. 2, with him.           He also gave

                   undertaking for welfare, security and protection of opposite party

                   no. 2. The father of opposite party no. 2 gave an undertaking that

                   he will not interfere in any matter, if his daughter will start living

                   happily with her husband. The petitioner was allowed to take

                   opposite party no. 2 along with him from the Court itself. On the

                   very next day, counsel for opposite party no. 2 mentioned this case

                   that the petitioner has committed a fraud with the Court by giving

                   a false undertaking. He took his wife, opposite party no. 2, along

                   with him to the Bus Stand and, thereafter, left her and disappeared.

                   The opposite party was left alone at Bus Stand and any how she

                   managed to contact her father. She kept on waiting at Hanuman

                   Temple where later on her father came and took her to his house.

</p><p id="p_2">                     2. When the matter was again listed on 21.04.2008,

            counsel for the petitioner stated that he will get the matter verified,

            as such, the matter was adjourned, and fixed for today.           The

            petitioner was directed to be physically present and an option was

            given to opposite party no. 2, if she desire, she may come.

</p><p id="p_3">                     3. Today, when the matter has been listed, opposite party

            no. 2 is present. There is no trace of petitioner. Counsel for the

            petitioner submits that in spite of information the petitioner has not

            contacted him. It means that the petitioner is an absconder and has

            committed a fraud upon Court, which is a serious matter.

</p><p id="p_4">                     4. The anticipatory bail application of the petitioner is

            dismissed. In case petitioner surrenders and moves for regular

            bail, the Court below while considering prayer for regular bail of

            petitioner will keep in consideration the conduct of the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_5">                     5. The Superintendent of Police, East Champaran,

            Motihari, is directed to take necessary steps for arrest of the

            petitioner in connection with Complaint Case No. 772 of 2004 (Tr.

            No. 2323 of 2006).
