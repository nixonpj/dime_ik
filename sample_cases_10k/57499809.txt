                      CIVIL JUDGE: DELHI

                                                          Petition No.: 643/2006

                                     Versus

State                                                         .....Respondent


J U D G M E N T:
</pre>

<p id="p_1">              The facts of the case in nutshell are that petitioner Smt. Sushila
Sharma has filed the present petition u/s 372 of <a href="/doc/1450343/" id="a_1">Indian Succession Act</a> for grant
of Succession Certificate in respect of the debts and securities of deceased Sh.
Dharam Varat Sharma who expired on 28.02.2006 at Delhi.
</p><p id="p_2">2.            After presentation of the petition, notice of the same was duly
given to the general public by way of publication in the newspaper "Statesman"
dated 10.4.2007, but none has appeared from the general public to file any
objections.
</p>

<p id="p_3">3.            Thereafter, petitioner Smt. Sushila Sharma examined herself as
PW-1 in the matter. She has stated in her evidence that deceased Sh.Dharam
Varat Sharma was her husband and he expired on 28.02.2006. The witness has
proved on record the death certificate of her husband as Ex.PW-1/1. She further
stated that besides her, deceased has left behind one son and three
                                                       Contd....2.
</p><p id="p_4">                                       0: 2 :
</p><p id="p_5">daughters namely Sh. Sudershan Sharma, Smt. Kanta Sharma, Smt. Geeta
Srivastava and Smt. Reeta Gola who are LRs in this petition and they have filed
their No Objections Ex. B to the grant of Succession Certificate in her favour.
She further stated that there is no other Class-I legal heir of the deceased except
me and LRs. She further stated that deceased was an ordinarily resident of
Delhi and he made no WILL during his life time. She further stated that mother
of the deceased had predeceased him. She further stated that deceased has left
behind debts and securities as mentioned in para 6 of the petition, the copies of
the said passbooks are Ex. PW-1/2 and Ex. PW-1/3. She further stated that the
amount of Rs.2,50,000/- lying in the FDR bearing no. 2362/12552 of the
deceased with Khattri Co-operative Bank Ltd. has been transferred in the SB
A/c bearing no. 4823 of the deceased.
</p><p id="p_6">4.       Therefore, in view of the above, I am of the considered opinion that
there is no impediment for grant of Succession Certificate in favour of petitioner
Smt. Sushila Sharma in respect of the debts and securities          of   deceased
Sh.Dharam Varat Sharma. I accordingly direct that Succession Certificate be
issued in favour of petitioner Smt. Sushila Sharma in respect of the debts and
securities of deceased Sh. Dharam Varat Sharma in terms of Ex.PW-1/2 and
Ex. PW-1/3, on filing of requisite court fee and on furnishing of an Indemnity
with one surety within 15 days.
</p><p id="p_7">              No further orders are required to be passed in the matter. File be
consigned to Record Room.</p><pre id="pre_2">
