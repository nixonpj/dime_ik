                             Mr. Pradeep Singh Chouhan, learned counsel for the applicant.
                             Ms. Nidhi Verma, Govt. Advocate for respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">                             This is the first application filed by the applicant/accused under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section
                      439</a> of Cr.P.C for grant of bail in connection with Crime No.270/2019
                      registered at Police Station-Ganj Betul District-Betul for the offence

                      punishable under <a href="/doc/92983/" id="a_2">Section 306</a> of IPC.
</p><p id="p_2">                             Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant is innocent
                      and has been falsely implicated. It is further submitted that the applicant has
                      never harassed the deceased, no tortured her and there is no direct or indirect
                      evidence, which shows involvement of the applicant in the offence. It is
                      submitted that if the applicant is enlarged on bail, he will not abscond or flee
                      from justice and he is ready and willing to abide by any reasonable conditions
                      that may be imposed against him in the event of admitting him on bail. He is in
                      custody since 09.07.2019. The applicant is permanent resident of the district

                      and there is no likelihood of his absconding or tampering with the prosecution
                      case. On these grounds, prayer is made to enlarge the applicant on bail.
</p><p id="p_3">                             Per contra, learned counsel for the State has vehemently opposed the
                      application and prayed for its rejection.
</p><p id="p_4">                               Heard learned counsel for the respective parties and perused the entire
                      documents annexed with the case diary. Looking to the entire facts and
                      circumstances of the case but without commenting anything on its merits, this
                      application is allowed. The applicant - Dhanraj is directed to be released on
                      bail upon his furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees
                      One Lac Only) with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the
                      concerned Court for his appearance before the trial Court on all such dates as
                      may be fixed in this behalf by the trial Court during the pendency of trial.</p><pre id="pre_2">
