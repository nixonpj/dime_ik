ACT:
Bombay	 Industrial   Disputes	 Act,	Gujarat	   Amendment
1962--Clauses 13 and 14 of section3--Entrustment  of   work
which  in  ordinarily  a  part	of  the	  undertaking--Legal
obligation of a factory to run a canteen under Section 46 of
Factories  Act--Entrustment  of	 running the  canteen  to  a
<a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_1">Cooperative  Society--Factories Act</a> 1948, <a href="/doc/19873808/" id="a_2">Section 2(1)</a>	work
incidental  to	the  manufacturing  process--Running  of   a
canteen by a textile mill.



HEADNOTE:
The appellant Textile Mill had a statutory obligation, as  a
factory, under the provisions of <a href="/doc/759329/" id="a_3">Section 46</a> of Factories Act
and the Rules made thereunder for maintaining a canteen	 for
its workers.  The appellant entrusted the management of	 the
canteen	 to  a	cooperative society.   The  workers  of	 the
canteen demanded additional wages and dearness allowance  in
terms of certain awards claiming that they were the employee
of the appellant within the meaning of Clauses (13) and (14)
of  Sec.  3 of the Bombay Industrial Disputes Act,  1938  as
amended	 by  Gujarat  Legislature  in  1962.   The   workers
contended  that the running of the canteen was	an  ordinary
part  of  the  undertaking of appellants,  since  it  was  a
statutory  obligation  for  the appellant  to  do  so.	 The
appellant  on the other hand contended that the	 cooperative
society	 was  neither  the  agent  nor	the  contractor	  of
appellant.
Rejecting the appeal,
HELD  :	 <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_4">Under	the Factories Act</a>, it was the  duty  of	 the
appellant  to  run and maintain canteen for the use  of	 its
employees.   Under  clauses (13) and (14) of  <a href="/doc/129487/" id="a_5">Section  3</a>  as
amended	 in 1962, the definition of an employee is  extended
by a fiction of law and certain employees are recognised  as
statutory employees.  The workers in question fall under the
said definition. [972B]

<p id="p_4">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
GROVER, J : This is an Appeal by special leave from an Order
of  the industrial Court,, Gujarat which reversed  an  order
made by the 2nd Labour Court, Ahmedabad.
</p><p id="p_5">Ramanlal  Chimanlal and others are the workers of a  canteen
which  is  run by the Saraspur	Mills  Canteen	Co-operative
Society	 Limited,  Ahmedabad  (hereinafter  called  the	 co-
operative  society).  The appellant company  is	 responsible
for maintaining the canteen under the provisions of<a href="/doc/759329/" id="a_7"> S. 46</a> of
the  Factories	Act  and the  rules  made  thereunder.	 The
appellant  handed over to the co-operative society the	task
of  running the canteen.  The workers mentioned above  filed
an  application	 before the 2nd Labour	Court  at  Ahmedabad
under  S.  79 of the Bombay Industrial Relations  Act,	1946
(hereinafter called the Act), complaining that the appellant
was not paying them the wages and dearness allowances as per
the  directions	 contained  in	the  Award  of	the   Bombay
Industrial  Court  made	 in Reference No.  18  of  1947	 and
supplementary	Award	given	in   certain   miscellaneous
applications.  of  1956 and 1962  respectively	relating  to
additional  wages  sanctioned  by the said  Award.   It	 was
alleged by the applicants in support of their claim that  by
virtue	of  certain  amendments	 made  in  the	Act  in	 the
definition of the word "employer" they became workers of the
appellant,  which  was	bound  to  pay	wages  and  dearness
allowances   settled   by  the	aforesaid  Award   and	 the
supplementary  Awards referred to.  The case of the  workmen
was that the appellant was running the canteen only  because
it was under an obligation to do so under the <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_8">Factories	 Act</a>
and  the  rules made thereunder.  Thus the  running  of	 the
canteen	 was  an  ordinary part of the	undertaking  of	 the
appellant.   It was admitted that the appellant did not	 run
the  canteen itself but handed over the premises to the	 co-
operative society to run the canteen for the use and welfare
of the mill's employees and discharge its legal obligations.
The  appellant	denied the allegations of the  workmen	that
they were its employees.  It was claimed that the  aforesaid
workers	 had never been employed either by the appellant  or
by its agent or contractor.  The workers in fact were stated
to have beep employed by the licences of the appellant	and,
therefore, there was no question of the wage settlements  or
Awards	being  binding on, the appellant.   The	 2nd  Labour
Court  by  its Order dated 14th April,	1966  dismissed	 the
claim  of  the	workmen,  who filed  an	 appeal	 before	 the
Industrial Court, which was allowed by its order dated	26th
March,	1968.  The Industrial Court held that the  employees
of the co-operative society, who were working in the canteen
were  employees	 of  the  appellant  and,  their  wages	 and
dearness allowance etc. were payable in	 accordance with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">969</span>
the  Awards mentioned before.  The direction was  made	that
the  appellant	should	pay  the  difference  in  wages	 and
dearness allowance in accordance with those Awards.
The  only question which requires determination	 is  whether
the  canteen  workers employed by  the	cooperative  society
could  be treated as employees of the appellant	 within	 the
meaning	 of  the  relevant provisions of  the  Act  for	 the
purpose of payment of their wages in spite of the fact	that
they are employees of the cooperative society and were	wing
paid  wages  by	 that society.	Prior  to  the	Act,  Bombay
Industrial  Disputes Act 1938 was in force in the  erstwhile
province  of Bombay.  Under that Act no statutory  employees
were  created  but  only those person-,	 who  were  directly
employed by the employer were treated as employees.  <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_9">The Act</a>
repealed  the 1938 Act.	 <a href="/doc/129487/" id="a_10">Section 3(13)</a> of the Act  contained
the definition of the term "employee". Before its  amendment
this provision	was as follows
	      "(13) and includes
</p><p id="p_6">	      (a)   a person employed by a contractor to  do
	      any  work	 for  him  in  the  execution  of  a
	      contract	with an employer within the  meaning
	      of sub-clause (e) of clause 14.
</p><p id="p_7">	      Sub-clause(e) of clause 14 is as follows
	       (14) " employer" includes (e) where the owner
	      of any undertaking in the course of or for the
	      purpose	 of   conducting   the	 undertaking
	      contracts with any person for the execution by
	      or  under the contractor of the whole  or	 any
	      part  of any work which is ordinarily part  of
	      the   undertaking,   'the	   owner   of	 the
	      undertaking".
</p><p id="p_8">	      <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_11">The  Factories  Act</a>, 1948 came into  force  on
	      April 1, 1949.  <a href="/doc/527913/" id="a_12">Section 2(1)</a> of that Act is as
	      follows:
</p><p id="p_9">	      "(1) 'worker' means a person employed directly
	      or  through any agency, whether for  wages  or
	      not,  in	any  manufacturing  process.  or  in
	      cleaning any part of the machinery or premises
	      used  for	 manufacturing process,	 or  in	 any
	      other kind of work incidental to, or connected
	      with,  the manufacturing process, or the	sub-
	      ject of manufacturing process"
</p><p id="p_10">The  expression 'occupier' was also defined by <a href="/doc/344019/" id="a_13">section	2(n)</a>
to mean the person who has ultimate control over the affairs
of the factory, and where the said affairs were entrusted to
a  managing  agent  such agent shall be	 deemed	 to  be	 the
occupier of the factory.  The Bombay High Court had held  in
certain	 matters which were brought before it that in  spite
of the fact that the L797Sup Cl/73
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">970</span>
co-operative  society was mentioned in the Bombay  Factories
Rules,	1950,  the  employee employed  by  the	co-operative
society	 could	not be treated as employees under  the	Act.
The  Gujarat  Legislature  passed an Act  in  1962  amending
clause,'  (13) and (14) of <a href="/doc/129487/" id="a_14">Section 3</a> of the Act.  After	 the
amendment these clauses run as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "(13)  'employee' means any person  (including
	      an apprentice) employed in any industry to any
	      skilled  or  unskilled  manual,	supervisory,
	      technical or clerical work for hire or reward,
	      whether the terms of employment be express  or
	      implied and includes (a) a person employed  in
	      the execution of any work in respect of  which
	      the  owner  of an undertaking is	an  employer
	      within the meaning of sub-clause (e) of clause
	      (14).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      (14)  'employer' includes-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      (e)Where	the owner of any  undertaking  in
	      the course of or for the purpose of conducting
	      the undertaking entrusts the execution of	 the
	      whole  or	 any  part  of	any  work  which  is
	      ordinarily  a part of the undertaking  to	 any
	      person otherwise than as the servant or  agent
	      of    the	   owner,   the	  owner	   of	 the
	      undertaking................
</blockquote><p id="p_11">The  Industrial.   Court  was  of the  view  that  the	term
"employee" under the Act had been given an extended meaning.
An  employee Was not only a person who was employed  by	 the
employer  or  over whom the employer had control,  but	also
certain	 types	of persons had	been  constituted  statutory
employees under the Act.  Before such a person could  become
the employee of the owner of the undertaking, the conditions
that   must  be	 fulfilled  were:  (1)	the  owner  of	 the
undertaking must entrust to any person the execution of	 the
whole or any part of any work; (2) such entrustment must  be
in the course of or for the purpose of conducting the under-
taking;	 (3) such entrustment must be otherwise than as	 the
servant or agent of the owner and (4) such work must be	 any
work which is ordinarily a part of the undertaking.
The  Industrial	 Court	referred to  the  earlier  decisions
including that of the Labour Appellate Tribunal and of	the,
Bombay	High Court and examined the circumstances  in  which
the  relevant provisions of the Act came to be amended.	  It
was pointed out that in the statement of objects and reasons
appearing  in  the Bill to the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_15">Amending Act</a>, it	 was  stated
that  the definition of an employee was being amended so  as
to  cover  persons  employed by a contractor  or  any  other
person to whom the owner of an undertaking had entrusted the
execution of any work which was ordinarily part
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">971</span>
of  the undertaking.  The definition of 'employee  was	also
amended correspondingly.  According to the Industrial  Court
there was a statutory obligation on the part of the mills to
provide a canteen and this obligation had been discharged by
the  mills  by	entrusting that	 task  to  the	co-operative
society,  even	if there was no positive  evidence  of	such
entrustment of work.  It was pointed out that the activities
of running the canteen could hardly have been undertaken  by
the  co-operative society unless it was entrusted to it	 by,
the  mills.   It  was finally held  that  although  the	 co-
operative  society which wag the real employer and  not	 the
present	 appellant, but by virtue of the fiction created  by
the amendment introduce,-' in the Act, the employees of	 the
Society	 became the employees of the appellant.	 They  were,
therefore, entitled to the benefits of the Awards.
The sole point which has been strenuously urged on behalf of
the  appellant	is  that on a  proper  construction  of	 the
amended clauses (13)- and (14) of <a href="/doc/129487/" id="a_16">Section 3</a> of the Act,	 the
workers, employed in the canteen which was being run by	 the
co-operative  society,	could  not  have  been	held  to  be
employees  of  the  appellant.	It  is	contended  that	 the
appellant  was	under  a  statutory  obligation	 because  of
<a href="/doc/759329/" id="a_17">section 46</a> of the Factories Act and the relevant rules	made
thereunder to maintain the Canteen for the workers, but	 the
canteen	 was being actually run by the	cooperative  society
and  the appellant had nothing to do with it nor did it	 pay
any  wages to the employees of the society who were  working
in the canteen.
</p><p id="p_12">The  matter  seems to be concluded by the judgment  of	this
Court in Civil Appeal No. 1044 of 1968 decided on April	 14,
1972, in which an identical argument had been addressed that
certain gardeners who had been employed by a contractor	 for
working	 in the gardens of the textile mills, could  not  be
said to fall within the definition of the word "employed" as
contained  in  <a href="/doc/129487/" id="a_18">Section	3</a> (13) of the  Act.   In  that	case
reference was made to the decision in <a href="/doc/1812187/" id="a_19">Basti Sugar Mills Ltd.
v. Ram Ujagar and Ors</a>. (1) It had been held that the workmen
fell within the definition of that word as given by<a href="/doc/527913/" id="a_20"> S. 2</a> (z)
of  the	 U.P.  Industrial Disputes Act	1947  as  they	were
persons	 employed  in  the industry to do  manual  work	 for
reward.	 The workmen had been employed by a contractor	with
whom  the mills had contracted in the course  of  conducting
the  industry  for execution by the said contractor  of	 the
work  of removal of press mud which is ordinarily a part  of
the industry.
</p><p id="p_13">The  above  case  was  treated	as  an	authority  for	 the
proposition that an employee engaged in a work or  operation
which was incidentally connected with the main industry	 was
a  workman  if	other  requirements  of	 the  statute	were
satisfied and that the Malis in that

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">972</span>
<p id="p_15">case  were workers.  It was pointed out that  the  bungalows
and  gardens on which the Malis in that case worked  were  a
kind of amenity supplied by the mills to its officers and on
this  reasoning	 the  Malis  were  held	 to  be	 engaged  in
operation  incidentally	 connected with	 the  main  industry
carried	 out by the employer.  The High Court  in  Ahmedabad
Mfg. &amp;	Calico Printing Co. Ltd. &amp; Ors v. Their Workmen	 (2)
had  relied  on the above ratio and came to  the  conclusion
that  the workers in order to come within the definition  of
an  "employee"	need not necessarily be	 directly  connected
with  the manufacture of textile fabrics.  The	decision  in
Basti Sugar Mills' case was treated as binding in the former
case.
</p><p id="p_16">Since,	under  the  <a href="/doc/1955064/" id="a_21">Factories Act</a> it was  the  duty  of	 the
appellant to run and maintain the canteen for the use of its
employees,  it appears to us that the ratio of the  decision
in  <a href="/doc/1022340/" id="a_22">Ahmedabad  Manufacturing &amp; Calico Printing Co.  Ltd.  v.
Their  Workmen</a> would, be fully applicable in which the	same
provisions of the Act were considered.

costs.
