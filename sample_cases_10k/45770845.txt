<p id="p_1">            Government       Public    Relation    and    Cultural       Affairs

Department, Haryana invited applications for 25 posts of Assistant

Public Relation Officers on 18.11.2007. A Committee was constituted

to conduct the interviews of the candidates. The petitioner, being

eligible and qualified, submitted his application and appeared for

interview on 9.12.2007. 226 candidates had applied and appeared

before the Committee, out of which 32 candidates were selected for

the post of Assistant Public Relation Officer.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Civil Writ Petition No.12867 of 2008                     :2 :</span><p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">            The grievance of the petitioner is that the selection was

not done on the basis of merit and the eligibility criteria was also

ignored. It is also stated that the appointment of respondent Nos.3 to

34 was made due to some extraneous considerations. The petitioner

accordingly has filed this writ petition to challenge the selection and

appointment of the private respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            One of the grounds, which was advanced by the counsel

for the petitioner when notice of motion was issued, was that the

persons appointed did not fulfill the criteria of experience.

</p><p id="p_5">            In response to notice, reply has been filed. Mr.Rathee

would refer to the reply filed by Additional Director-II, Information and

Public Relations Department on behalf of respondent Nos.1 &amp; 2. It is

stated in the reply that because of unreasonable nature of the

experience as prescribed, the requirement of experience was relaxed

after taking approval from the State Government. The reasons given

in this regard are that at the time of registration, it was noticed by the

Committee     that   the   experience   certificates   attached   by the

candidates were not as per the requirement of the department. The

requirement of experience as given in the advertisement was for a

candidate to have one year experience in a Publicity Organisation of

Union or State Government on a post of comparable responsibility or

one year experience as full time correspondent or an Editor or Sub

Editor of weekly newspaper or whole time correspondent in a news

agency. No honorary or part time experience was to be counted. In

this background, it was noticed that the correspondents working in

the news agencies would not come to apply for a post on contract

basis and that too when it was initially advertised for a period of six
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Civil Writ Petition No.12867 of 2008                        :3 :</span>

months only. It is stated that a person working on regular basis would

not be interested to leave the regular job and apply for a job on

contract basis. Since the candidates did not fulfill the condition of

experience, more particularly, the whole time experience in a

newspaper having requisite circulation, it was decided on the spot to

register   the    candidates,    who        fulfill   the    conditions    of

academic/professional     qualifications,      subject      to     Government

approval regarding relaxation of experience. The condition of

experience for engagement of ADPROs on contract basis was

relaxed by the Government on 11.3.2008 and thereafter the persons

were engaged on the basis of their merit as per the performance in

the interview and the marks obtained in the selection criteria.

</p><p id="p_6">           The grievance of the petitioner is that the relaxation was

given subsequent to the selection. The stand in the reply is that the

selection was done subject to the approval being granted by the

Government. Since the Government had granted the approval and

had relaxed the experience criteria, the same was uniformly made

applicable to all the candidates. It would have been rather more

appropriate for the respondents to invite fresh applications, once the

decision was taken to relax the condition of experience. In any case,

there was sufficient number of candidates already available for the

posts advertised and the reason for which the condition of

experience was relaxed does not sound unreasonable. The

justification offered appears reasonable. No person, who is working

on a regular post or had been having an experience on a regular post

of more than a year with a reputed newspaper or a news agency etc.

would be interested in taking a contractual employment. Contractual
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Civil Writ Petition No.12867 of 2008                          :4 :</span>

employment, otherwise also, could be terminated at any time. The

submission by the counsel for the petitioner that though appointed in

the year 2007 but the appointments have been continued would not

make the status of job to be of permanent nature. The appointments

would remain contractual employments.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                Apart   from   the   submission    that   the    condition   of

qualification was relaxed, nothing is urged to show that the merit was

sacrificed. I am, thus,        not inclined to interfere in exercise of writ

jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                The writ petition is accordingly dismissed.
