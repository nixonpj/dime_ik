<p id="p_1">                       Mr. Rupak Ghosh,
                       Mr. Saunak Sengupta.
</p><p id="p_2">                                     ... for the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_3">                       Mr. Siba Prasad Ghose.
</p><p id="p_4">                                     ... for the opposite party.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                       This revisional application is directed against an
                 order dated 17th August, 2017 passed by the learned
                 Additional District Judge, 2nd Court, Barrackpore in
                 Title Appeal No. 54 of 2016, by which an application
                 for stay of the execution proceeding is disposed of
                 directing the petitioner to pay the occupational
                 charges at the rate of Rs.15,000/- per month till the
                 disposal of the appeal.
</p><p id="p_6">                       Admittedly the plaintiff/opposite party filed a
                 suit for eviction against a monthly tenant, inter alia,
                 on the ground of default and reasonable requirement.
                 The suit premises is a shop room. The Trial Court
                 decreed the suit holding that the plaintiff/opposite
                 party reasonably requires the suit premises for his
                 own use and occupation.
</p><p id="p_7">                       Th judgement and decree is carried to the
                 Appellate Court by filing Title Appeal No. 54 of 2016.
                 An application for stay of the execution proceeding
                 was taken out therein under Order XLI Rule 5 of the
                 Code of Civil Procedure alleging that if the execution is
                 allowed to be proceeded with during the pendency of
                 the appeal and is ultimately executed, the appeal
                 would virtually become infructuous.
</p><p id="p_8">                       The plaintiff/opposite party produces a rent
                 receipt in respect of the similar shop room in the same
                 premises measuring about 44 sq. ft. in support of the
                 stand that the tenant of the said shop room is paying
                 a rent at the rate of Rs.5,000/- per month.
</p><p id="p_9">                       It is not in dispute that the suit premises
                 comprises of 150 sq. ft. and the Appellate Court
                 multiplied the rent fetched for the shop room
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                            2</span>


measuring about 44 sq. ft. by three times and directed
the petitioner to pay a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month
as and by way of occupational charges as condition
precedent to stay the execution proceeding.
</p><p id="p_10">      There is no quarrel to the proposition of law laid
down in case of <a href="/doc/176067509/" id="a_1">Atmaram Properties vs. Federal Motors</a>
reported in (2005) 1 SCC 705 that the Appellate Court
should not grant unconditional stay of the execution
proceeding, if the decree relates to an eviction of a
monthly tenant. The Apex Court held that the Court
should strike the balance between the rights of the
rival parties and merely because a statutory remedy is
provided by way of an appeal, the unsuccessful
litigant should not get walkover on the right of the
successful litigant.
</p><p id="p_11">      There is no hesitation in my mind that the order
of stay of the execution proceeding should not be
passed without imposing a condition of depositing the
occupational charges at the prevalent market rate.
</p><p id="p_12">      Both the parties in the instant proceeding have
relied upon the documents and the Court found that
the present market rent for a shop room having
similar   area   is    Rs.15,000/-   per   month.    The
comparison was made to a shop room having lesser
area and it would not be safe to ascertain the
quantum of rent for the larger premises. In absence of
any impeccable evidence of a comparable premises the
Court can apply a robust common sense gained from
experience.
</p><p id="p_13">      This Court finds that it would be fair and
reasonable that the petitioner should be directed to
deposit a sum of Rs.10,000/- instead of Rs.15,000/-
per month as occupational charges as condition for
stay of the execution proceeding.
</p><p id="p_14">      Accordingly, the petitioner is directed to deposit
a sum of Rs.10,000/- per month as occupational
charges from the date of the decree till October, 2017
in the Trial Court within fortnight from date.
</p><p id="p_15">      The occupational charges for the month of
November, 2017 shall be deposited in the like manner
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                3</span>


within 7th December, 2017 and all subsequent
deposits shall be made on or before 7th of each
succeeding month.
</p><p id="p_16">      In   default   of   the   deposit   of   the   arrears
occupational charges or for any month, the order of
stay shall stand automatically vacated and it shall be
open to the plaintiff/opposite party to proceed with
the execution proceeding irrespective of the fact that
the appeal is pending.
</p><p id="p_17">      Considering the nature of the decree, this Court
requests the Court of Appeal below to ensure that the
Lower Court Record is brought to it within fortnight
from the date of the communication of this order.
</p><p id="p_18">      The Appellate Court shall prepone the date
already fixed and shall see that the appeal is disposed
of within two months from the date of the receipt of
the Lower Court Record in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_19">      The revisional application is thus disposed of.
      There will be no order as to costs.
</p>
