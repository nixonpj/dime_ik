        This common award will dispose off two petitions bearing

No.   420/2004   (hereinafter   referred   to   Ist   case)   &amp;   419/2004

(hereinafter referred to IInd case) under <a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_1">Sections 166</a>/<a href="/doc/32775809/" id="a_2">140</a> of the

Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, (herein after referred to as Act) filed by

the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">2.      The   facts   of   the   petitioners   cases   in   brief   are   that   on

17.05.2003 the petitioner Ravish Chopra was going on scooter No.

DL­4SG­5524   to   Ghaziabad   from   Delhi   alongwith   his   friend

Sonu.     At   about   3.00   P.M   when   they   reached   G.T.   Road   near

Shyam Lal College, his friend Sonu who was driving the scooter

applied the brakes  to slow down in order to save a rickshaw wala.

A U.P. Roadways Bus No. UP­15­A­1868(herein after referred to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                        3</span>

as the offending vehicle) being driven by its driver respondent No.

2 in a very rash and negligent manner and at a high speed came

from behind and hit their scooter.  As a result both the petitioners

fell down alongwith his friend and they sustained grievous injuries

on their person.  The petitioners were removed to GTB Hospital.

The petitioners claimed compensation of Rs. 3 lacs each from the

respondents being owner and driver of the offending vehicle.



</p><p id="p_9">3.     Respondent Nos. 1 &amp; 2 contested their cases on the grounds

interalia, that there was no fault of the driver of the bus in the

accident.   They further pleaded that the petitioners were coming

on their scooter from wrong side of the road and a rickshaw was

also   coming   from   wrong   side.     The   driver   of   the   scooter   was

driving  the scooter at a fast speed   and in a rash and negligent

manner   and  while  overtaking  the  rickshaw  the  scooter  collided

with the rickshaw and fell on road in front of the bus and there

was very slight impact by bus.  They denied rest of the allegations

and prayed for dismissal of petitions pleading that this may be a

case of contributory negligence.

<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">4.     As both petitions were relating to same accident, therefore,

both   these   petitions   were   consolidated   vide   order   dated

06.07.2004.

<p id="p_18">
FINDINGS ON ISSUE NO.1

</p><p id="p_19">9.      PW­3   and   PW­4   in   their   affidavits   Ex.PW3/A   and

Ex.PW4/A interalia stated that on 17.05.2003 they were travelling

on scooter NO. DL­4SG­5524 and were going towards Ghaziabad.

At   about   3.00   PM   when   they   reached   in   front   of   Shyam   Lal

College, G.T. Road, Shahdara, Sh. Sonu slowed down the speed of

their   scooter   as   a   rickshaw   had   come   in   their   front.     An   U.P.

Roadways bus no. UP­50­A­1868 which was coming on a high

speed hit their scooter from behind.  As a result they fell down and

sustained grievous injuries.   The driver of the offending vehicle

was apprehended at the spot by the public persons.   They were

removed to GTB Hospital.   Police on information reached at the

hospital and recorded their statements.  In cross examination PW­

3 deposed that in order to avoid the impact with rickshaw Uttam

slowed down the speed and turned their scooter.   Due to sudden

turning the scooter came in the channel of the bus.  It was denied

that   had   the   rickshaw   not   come   in   front   of   their   scooter   the

accident could have not taken place.  It was also denied that they

were trying to overtake the rickshaw by driving the scooter in rash
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                         6</span>

and negligent manner and in that process scooter hit the rickshaw

and they fell down and then they were hit with the bus.  RW­1 on

this aspect deposed that on 17.05.2003 he was going from Delhi to

Khatauli, U.P.  There was red light signal at Shyam Lal College.

A   scooterist   hit   the   cycle   rickshaw   as   a   result   of   which   the

occupants   of   scooter   fell  down  on  the  road   and  they  sustained

injuries.  The said scooter never hit the bus in any manner.  The

accident   had   taken   place   due   to   sole   negligence   of   driver   of

scooter.  However in the cross examination he admitted that police

arrested him and a criminal case against him is pending before the

criminal court.  FIR No. 141/2003 at Shahdara Police station was

also registered against respondent No. 2.   PW­1 proved copy of

FIR   as   Ex.PW1/A.     It   implicate   respondent   No.   2   and   the

offending  vehicle.   In view of the reasons and discussion made

herein above it is held that petitioner Sh. Uttam Chand @ Sonu

and   Sh.   Ravish   Chopra   sustained   injuries   due   to   rash   and

negligent   driving   by   respondent   No.   2.     This   issue   is   decided

accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_20">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">FINDINGS ON ISSUE NO. 2</span>

</p><p id="p_21">10.    Let us see whether Sonu @ Uttam Chand and Sh. Ravish

Chopra sustained injuries due to contributory negligence of Shri

Sonu @ Uttam Chand?   The driving licence of respondent No. 2
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                        7</span>

was  filed.    It  was  valid  on the  date  of  accident  because it  was

renewed   for   the   period   15.02.2001   to   14.02.2004.   In   cross

examination PW­4 Shri Uttam @ Sonu, who was allegedly driving

the scooter admitted that he did not have any driving licence for

driving the scooter.  He failed to file and prove that he was having

valid driving licence to drive the scooter on the date of accident.

Since   he   was  driving  the  scooter  without  driving  licence,  it  is,

therefore,   presumed   that   he   was   not   aware   about   the   skill   of

driving.   As he found doing so it can safely be held that he was

guilty of contributory negligence.  
</p>
<p id="p_22">

</p><p id="p_23">11.    In view of the reasons and discussions made herein above it

is held that  Sh. Sonu @ Uttam was also liable for contributory

negligence and due to driving of offending vehicle by respondent

Nos. 1 and 2 and scooter by Sonu @ Uttam Chand, Sh. Sonu @

Uttam  and  Sh.  Ravish  Chopra sustained  injuries.   This  issue  is

accordingly   decided   in   favour   of   respondents   and   against

petitioner of suit No. 419/04.  
</p>
<p id="p_24">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">FINDINGS ON ISSUE NO. 3</span>

</p><p id="p_25">12.    As it has been held herein above that Shri Sonu @ Uttam

Chand and Ravish Chopra sustained injuries in rash and negligent

driving of respondent no. 2, therefore they became entitled to get
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                         8</span>

compensation.     Now,   it   has   to   be   seen   what   is   the   extent   of

compensation, they are entitled to get and from whom?



</p><p id="p_26">13.    PW­2   proved  MLC  of  Shri  Ravish  Chopra  as  Ex.PW1/A

and MLC of Shri Sonu as Ex.PW2/B.   PW­4 Shri Sonu proved

medical   bills   as   Ex.P1   to   P15   and   original   medical   papers   as

Ex.P16 to P20.  PW­5 proved admission and discharge record of

Shri  Ravish  Chopra and Sh. Sonu as Ex.PW5/1 and Ex.PW5/2.

He   also   admitted   that   Sh.   Ravish   Chopra   was   admitted   in   the

hospital   on   18.05.2003   and   discharged   on   22.052003   and   Sh.

Sonu was admitted in the hospital on 20.05.2003 and discharged

on   31.05.2003.     He   further   stated   that   treatment   record   of   Sh.

Ravish Chopra consisted of 16 pages and treatment record of Sh.

Sonu consisted of 35 pages.   Total of the medical bills Ex.P1 to

P15 of Sh. Sonu comes to Rs.53,667.00.   Total of medical bills

Ex.PW3/13   to   Ex.PW3/30   of   Sh.   Ravish   Chopra   comes   to

Rs.31,899.00.  The total of other bills of Sh. Ravish Chopra Ex.PA

to  PQ4  comes to Rs.36,152.00.   Bill  Ex.PA to PQ4 are for the

period   from   21.05.2003   to   06.11.04.     The   bill   Ex.PW3/13   to

Ex.PW3/30 are for the period from 28.01.2005 to 19.04.2005.



</p><p id="p_27">14.    It has been argued on behalf of counsel for respondents that

the bill Ex.PW3/13 to Ex.PW3/30 have no relevance and nexus
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                        9</span>

with the present case as these are the bills for a period after more

than one and half year later than the date of accident.  Treatment

record   of   Sh.   Ravish   Chopra   for   this   period   are   Ex.PW3/1   to

Ex.PW3/12.     It   pertains   to   the   treatment   of   left   femur.     The

original MLC of Ravish Chopra is Ex.PW2/A.  This shows that X­

ray of pelvis as well as thigh were got conducted.   The medical

report has thus established the connection of treatment obtained

by the petitioner Ravish Chopra in Delhi soon after accident and

at Chandigarh  in the year 2005.   Therefore, it is held that Shri

Sonu   @   Uttam   Chand   has   established   that   he   had  spent

Rs.53,667.00  and  Shri  Ravish  Chopra has  spent  Rs.63,040/­  on

their treatment. 
</p>
<p id="p_28">

</p><p id="p_29">15.    PW­3   Sh.   Ravish  Chopra  and  PW­4 Shri  Uttam  @  Sonu

admitted  in   their   cross  examination  that  they  did  not  have  any

disability   certificate   with   them.     They   have   neither   filed   nor

proved   any   document   showing   their   income   on   the   date   of

accident.   Like is the position of their educational qualifications.

Sh.   Sonu   PW­4   in   his   affidavit   interalia   stated   that   he   spent

Rs.10,000/­   on   conveyance   and   Rs.15,000/­   on   special   diet,

besides, medical expenses of Rs.70,000/­.  As mentioned above he

had filed and proved medical bills only for Rs.31,899.00.  He also

claimed   compensation   for   loss   of   earnings   for   five   months   @
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                       10</span>

Rs.5000/­   per   month.     PW­3   Shri   Ravish   also   claimed

compensation for loss of earnings for nine months @ Rs.4500/­

per month,  besides, Rs.15,000/­  on conveyance and Rs.10,000/­

on   special   diet   in   addition   to   the   medical   treatment   expenses.

There is no document on record to show the monthly income of

either Sh. Uttam Chand @ Sonu or Sh. Ravish Chopra.  There is

also no document to show the period of their absence from duty.



</p><p id="p_30">16.    In a case of  Sh. Bijoy Kumar Dugar Vs. Bidyadhar Dutta

and others 2006 ACJ 1058 the court observed that there was head

on collision with a car and bus being driven by respondent and the

victim.     Observing   that   deceased   should   have   taken   care   and

precaution to avoid head on collision, both the drivers of car and

bus were held guilty of contributory negligence.  The Tribunal had

awarded Rs.1,76,800/­ out of total compensation of Rs.3,53,600/­

due to the contributory negligence of the deceased.   Relying on

the principles  of said case, I am of the view that  Shri Sonu @

Uttam Chand is not entitled to get full amount of compensation

which is going to be assessed in his favour   He will get 75% of

compensation.
