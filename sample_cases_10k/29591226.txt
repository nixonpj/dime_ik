             O.P.(Crl)No.128 of 2018
             ---------------------------
      Dated this the 15th day of March, 2018

                        JUDGMENT
</pre>


<p id="p_1">     The     petitioners   herein   stands    convicted    in

CC.No.708/2009 of Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,

Alappuzha.      They were sentenced to undergo RI for

three years and to pay a fine of Rs.1,00,000/- each

for offence under sections 420 read with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_1">section 34</a> of

the Indian Penal Code with a default sentence. It was

directed that if the fine amount was realised, it shall

be paid as compensation to PW2 under <a href="/doc/1644380/" id="a_2">section 357(1)</a>

of Cr.P.C.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.      The petitioners challenge the conviction and

sentence in Crl.Appeal No.40/2018.           Along with the

appeal, Crl.M.P.1047/2017 was also filed to suspend

the sentence and to release him on bail.                  The

appellate court by Ext.P2 order, dated 19.02.2018

suspended the sentence on execution of bond with a
O.P.(Crl)No.128 of 2018

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>



rider that each of the petitioner shall deposit before

the   trial   court   Rs.50,000/-   each    being   50%   of

compensation within one month.             Aggrieved by the

above order, the petitioners herein have approached

this court.    Evidently, the petitioners have exercised

their statutory right of appeal. Definitely, it is with in

the domain of the court below to re-appreciate the

entire facts and to pass appropriate orders on the

basis of the materials on record.          The court below,

while correctly suspending the sentence seems to have

imposed a condition, which turn out to be onerous.

Hence, I am inclined to modify Ext.P2 order, by

directing that the sentence will stand suspended and

bail granted to the petitioners herein on executing a

bond for a sum of Rs.20,000/- with two sureties for

the like sum each to the satisfaction of the trial court

and also on condition that each of the petitioner

deposits a sum of Rs.10,000/- before the trial court

within one month.
