<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                           5</span>

PW14 is SI Rajesh Kumar, the I.O of this case, who has deposed,

regarding the investigation(s), as were carried out by him, during the

course of the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.     Thereafter, statement of the accused U/s 313 Cr. PC was

recorded, in which the defence of the accused was that he had been

falsely implicated in this case and all the prosecution witnesses were

false and he also chose to lead evidence in defence.

</p><p id="p_12">11.     In defence, accused has examined three witnesses. DW1 is

Pankaj Kumar, Inspector Food and Supply, Rithala Circle, who has

proved the ration card of the family of the complainant, Ex.PW3/DA,

(already exhibited), DW2 is Deepak, the husband of the prosecutrix,

DW3 is Jagdish, the sarpanch of the native village of the accused.

</p><p id="p_13">12.     I have heard the Ld. Defence counsel Sh. J.P. Singh and Sh.

A.K. Srivastava, Ld. Addl. PP for the state and perused the record.

Ld. Defence counsel has also relied upon judgments, 1992 Crl. LJ

4073, 1998(2) JCC Delhi 122.
</p>
<p id="p_14">13.     Ld. Defence counsel has argued that the age of the prosecutrix


State Vs. Sumran Singh   PS Sultan Puri   FIR No.458/05   1-22
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                           6</span>

was more than 16 years, as in the bone age report, Ex.PW9/A, her

age has been opined between 14 to 16 years, and the Principal from

the Government School and the teacher from the Primary School,

have admitted that the date of birth of the prosecutrix was entered in

the school record on the basis of affidavit of father of the prosecutrix,

and consequently he has argued that there is no cogent proof,

regarding the date of birth of the prosecutrix, and as per settled law a

margin of two years in the bone age of the prosecutrix has to be

accorded in favour of the accused in view of the judgment AIR 1982

SC 1296, and thereby the age of the prosecutrix would be more than

16 years and would be around 18 years at the time of the incident.

</p><p id="p_15">14.     He has further argued that from the testimony of the

prosecutrix, it was apparent that prosecutrix had accompanied the

accused of her own volition and without any enticement on the part of

the accused, and she had number of opportunities to raise an alarm

at various places, despite that she did not raise any alarm attracting

the attention of the public persons, that she had been abducted by the


State Vs. Sumran Singh   PS Sultan Puri   FIR No.458/05   1-22
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                           7</span>

accused. He also argued that prosecutrix in her deposition has also

admitted that she had performed marriage with the accused in Mandir

and she had also admitted her signatures on the marriage

documents, placed on the record, and these documents, clearly show

that the prosecutrix was a consenting party, and she accompanied the

accused of her own, without any enticement on his part. Therefore,

he has argued that the accused deserves acquittal.

</p><p id="p_16">15.     On the other hand, Ld. Addl. PP for the state has argued that

prosecutrix has been able to make out a case beyond any doubt

against the accused, as from the testimony of the prosecutrix, it was

clear that it was the accused, who had enticed or taken her away on

the pretext that she had failed in school examination and if her

parents would know the same, they would beat her and thereafter

confining her. The accused raped her against her wishes and from

the overall deposition of prosecutirx it was clear that prosecutrix was

not a consenting party.
</p>
<p id="p_17">16.     He has further argued that the age of the prosecutrix was


State Vs. Sumran Singh   PS Sultan Puri   FIR No.458/05   1-22
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                           8</span>

around 14 years at the time of the incident, as per the school record,

produced by the prosecution witnesses, her date of birth has been

proved to be 30.11.1991, and at the time of submitting of affidavit by

her father, at the time of her admission, he could not have visualized

that the same would be required later on in some criminal trial, and he

has argued that the margin of two years has already been given by

the radiologist, who conducted the bone age of the prosecutrix,

therefore, her age was definitely less than 16 years, at the time of the

incident. Consequently, he has argued that from the overall evidence

of the prosecution, the accused deserves to be convicted.

</p><p id="p_18">17.     Regarding the age of the prosecutrix, as per the prosecution

story, the age of the prosecutrix was 14 years on the date of the

occurrence i.e on 25.03.2005. The prosecutrix (L) in her statement

U/s 164 Cr. PC, Ex.PW4/A had stated her age as 13 years, and in her

deposition in the court on 10.10.2005, she stated her age to be 14

years. Her father PW3 Ram Jatan stated that her family consisted of

himself, his wife, six children and prosecutrix was youngest of his


State Vs. Sumran Singh   PS Sultan Puri   FIR No.458/05   1-22
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                           9</span>

children, and she was born in the year 1991, and her place of birth

was Delhi. In his cross-examination, he stated that my third child took

birth in the year 1981, next to him in 1983, then in 1985 and last one

year, and his daughter involved in this case was his last child, after

1987. He further deposed that he had obtained the birth registration

certificate of all children, who were born in Delhi, and it was deposited

by him in the schools.
</p>
<p id="p_19">18.     Later on, when his cross-examination was again carried out on

03.01.2007, he stated that at the admission of the prosecutrix to

primary school, he had given a janampatri, as proof of her age. At the

time of admission in middle school, school leaving certificate from

primary school was submitted in proof of her age.

</p><p id="p_20">19.     However, as per PW5 Smt. S.K. Gupta, Vice Principal,

Sarvodya Kanya Vidyalya, Rithala, the date of birth of the prosecutrix,

who was studying in their school, as per the school record was

30.11.1991. In her cross-examination, she stated that the date of

birth of prosecutrix was entered on the basis of school leaving


State Vs. Sumran Singh   PS Sultan Puri   FIR No.458/05   1-22
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                           10</span>

certificate of MCD School.
</p>
<p id="p_21">20.     Thereafter, PW11 Smt. Vinita Kumari, Teacher from the MCD

Primary School, Rithala-I, was also examined by the prosecution and

she stated that as per the school record, in their school, the date of

birth of the prosecutrix as per the admission register was 30.11.1991,

and in her cross-examination, carried out 20.03.2007, she stated that

as per the records, maintained by the school, an affidavit of Ram

Jatan, father of the prosecutrix was placed on record along with the

admission form in proof of date of birth and said affidavit was also

exhibited as Ex.PW11/DA, and that there was no other document,

except the affidavit, Ex.PW11/DA, available on the school record to

establish the date of birth of the prosecutrix.

</p><p id="p_22">21.     From the testimony of the aforesaid official witnesses, from the

school, where the prosecutrix was studying, it was apparent that her

admission was done in the primary school of the MCD, on the basis of

affidavit submitted by her father, whereas PW3 Ram Jatan has stated

once in his cross-examination that he had obtained the birth


State Vs. Sumran Singh   PS Sultan Puri   FIR No.458/05   1-22
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                           11</span>

registration certificate of all his children, born in Delhi and the same

was deposited by him in the school, and prosecutrix was born in

Delhi, and in his further cross-examined, carried out on the next date,

he stated that he had submitted janampatri of the prosecutrix, as

proof of her age.
</p>
<p id="p_23">22.     Consequently, it appears that the father of the prosecutrix was

not even sure what document he had submitted, as age proof of the

prosecutrix at the time of her admission in the school. Ultimately, it

was found from the testimony of PW11 that he had only submitted an

affidavit, as age proof of the prosecutrix, while her admission was

done in the MCD Primary School, and no other authentic proof of her

date of birth in the shape of municipal certificate or panchayat

certificate was provided to the school authorities at the time of

admission of the prosecutrix, and the testimony of PW3 in his cross-

examination is vague, regarding the age of the prosecutrix, as he had

stated that his third child took birth in the year 1981, next to him in the

deposition of PW3, it appears that prosecutrix was born in the year

1986. However, he has further stated in his examination-in-chief, that

proscutrix was born in the year 1991. Therefore, it appears that the

father of the prosecutrix was not even sure about her date of birth,

which is not even otherwise proved from the official record of the

school, produced on the record by the prosecution.

</p><p id="p_24">23.     In these circumstances, the testimony of PW9 Dr. R.K. Mishra,

Radiologist is relevant, who after conducting the bone age of the

prosecutrix in his report, Ex.PW9/A has given his opinion that the age

of the prosecutrix was between 14 to 16 years. In the said report, he

has not opined, whether any margin of error has already been given

in the said bone age report, and in view of the judgment relied upon

by the Ld. Defence counsel, AIR 1982 SC 1296 (supra), a margin of

error in age ascertained by radiological examination is 2 years on

either side. In view of the said judgment, if the said margin of 2 years

is given in favour of the accused, then the age of the prosecutrix

would come to be around 18 years.

</p><p id="p_26">24.     However, in Delhi, after the promulgation of rules framed under

the Juvenile Justice (Care and <a href="/doc/1973522/" id="a_8">Protection of the Children) Act</a> 2000,

more specifically as per rule 12, framed under the said act, a margin

of 1 year has to be accorded in the favour of the child or juvenile by

considering his age to be on the lower side within the margin of 1

year. In the present scenario the margin of 1 year has to be accorded

in favour of the accused. Consequently, the age of the prosecutrix

would be around 17 years at the time of the incident, as in view of the

aforesaid discussion, the school record, produced on the record by

the prosecution was not based upon any authentic source or

information, or that it can be said that the entries in the school record

could be vouch safed to be having sanctity of correctness. Further

from a mere glance of the photographs, Ex.PW2/DC and Ex.PW2/DD,

admitted by the prosecutrix, in her cross-examination, it cannot be

said on bare perusal of the same, that the prosecutrix would be

around 14 years, at the time of the incident. Rather, from the said

photographs, it appears that the prosecutrix was much more mature

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                           14</span>

in appearance than a child of 14 years would appear to be.

</p><p id="p_27">25.     Consequently, the age of the prosecutrix is proved to be 17

years at the time of the incident.
</p>
<p id="p_28">26.     To make out an offence U/S 366 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">IPC</a>, the prosecution has to

prove the following ingredients:
</p>
<p id="p_29">  1. Kidnapping or abducting any woman,
</p><p id="p_30">  2. Such kidnapping or abducting must be:
</p><p id="p_31">  (a) with intent that she may be compelled or knowing it to be
  likely that she will be compelled to marry any person against
  her will; or

</p><p id="p_32">(b) in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit

intercourse or knowing it to be likely that she will be forced or

seduced to illicit intercourse.
</p>
<p id="p_33">27.     Regarding the offence U/s 363/366 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a>, the gist of the

aforesaid offence U/s 363/366 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11">IPC</a> is taking or enticing away of a

minor within the specified age limit or of a person of unsound mind out

of the keeping of a lawful guardian. Further, kidnapping within the

meaning of <a href="/doc/619940/" id="a_12">Section 363</a> IPC is affected not only by taking or enticing

away a person, but also by alluring such a person to go away from the

protection of the guardian. (AIR 1973 SC 819).
</p>
<p id="p_34">28.     PW2 prosecutrix (L) has deposed in her examination-in-chief

that she was living in the same house for last about 10 years. Her

parents, her four brothers and her one sister besides her live in the

same house. She was youngest children of her parents. Till the date

of incident, she was studying in VIIth class at Rana Partap Sarvodya

Kanya Vidyalya.
</p>
<p id="p_35">        She knew the accused. Accused was residing at the gap of

two galis in the backside of her house.                   Accused was frequently

coming to her street. He was known to her since one year prior to the

date of incident. There was one PCO booth in her house and the

accused was visiting that PCO booth repeatedly.                   On 24.03.2005,

accused telephoned her and informed her that he had found out from

her school, that she had flunked in VIIth class and he further told her

that her parents will be unhappy and would beat her. Therefore, he

would take her with him from her house. Accused offered her to take

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                             16</span>

her to her Mama at Jaipur. She agreed to the proposal.

</p><p id="p_36">        Same day on 24.03.2005, at about 1:00 p.m, accused came to

her street and took her from her house. At that time, her brother and

her father were not in the house, as they had gone for their work. Her

mother was not present in the house, as she had gone in the

neighbourhood. Accused had brought one van and he took her in that

van. She did not knew, where did he took her. He took her to some

unknown place in a hotel.                 Accused kept her in a hotel room.

Accused committed rape upon her in that hotel room.                Thereafter

accused took her to various other places, till he was apprehended by

the police and her statement was also recorded by the Ld. MM later

on, which is Ex.PW2/A.
</p>
<p id="p_37">29.     The prosecutrix was extensively cross-examined by the Ld.

Defence counsel. In her cross-examination also she reiterated that

the house of the accused was at the back of two galis of their old

house, and that she used to go along with the accused from her

present house to old house, and accused was well known to her.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                           17</span>

From the aforesaid deposition of the prosecutrix, it appears that the

prosecutrix and the accused were well known to the each other prior

to the incident, therefore, identity of the accused has been clearly

established.
</p>
<p id="p_38">30.     From the cross-examination of the prosecutrix, it is apparent

that the prosecutrix was enticed by the accused on the pretext that

she had flunked in the call 7th examination and that if her parents

would know the same, then she would be severely scolded, and the

prosecutrix got struck in the web of words woven by the accused, and

agreed to accompany him, as the accused offered her to leave her at

the house of her mama at Jaipur. In the cross-examination, nothing

has come out, which could suggest that the prosecutrix had

accompanied the accused of her own volition or that she had left the

custody of her parents, out of her own volition. Rather, it appears that

accused had enticed her on the false pretext by threatening that she

would be scolded by her parents, as she had failed in class 7th

examinations, barring some improvements in her cross-examination,


State Vs. Sumran Singh   PS Sultan Puri   FIR No.458/05   1-22
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                           18</span>

nothing material has come, which could show that the prosecutrix was

lying on the said aspect.
</p>
<p id="p_39">31.     From the testimony of the prosecutrix, it is clear that the

accused had taken her away from the lawful custody of her guardian

without his consent and as discussed above, the consent of the minor

kidnapped is of no defence, U/s 363 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_13">IPC</a> and the said offence is not

only made out by enticing the minor from the lawful custody of her

guardian, but also includes the cases, where the minor is taken away

from the lawful custody of the guardian without the consent of the

guardian. Consequently, ingredient No.1 of the offence U/s 366 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14">IPC</a>

has been clearly proved by the prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_40">        Regarding the second ingredient: For proving the said

ingredient, the intention of accused is most relevant, once the

necessary intention of the accused is established, the offence is

complete, whether or not the accused succeeded in effecting his

purpose, and whether or not in the event the woman consented to the

marriage or the illicit intercourse.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                           19</span>

</p><p id="p_42">32.     Regarding this, in the cross-examination of prosecutrix, certain

documents of her alleged marriage with the accused and certain

photographs of the marriage were put to her. She admitted that she

signed the document, Ex.PW2/DA &amp; Ex.PW2/DB, and that she signed

those documents voluntarily, and that it was correct that they had

gone to some mandir, where they performed their marriage and that it

was correct that photographs pasted on papers, Ex.PW2/DC &amp;

Ex.PW2/DD are of her marriage, and in her examination-in-chief, she

also alleged that accused had raped her.
</p>
<p id="p_43">33.     The accused had also examined one defence witness, namely,

DW3 Jagdish, Sarpanch of the Village Kheri, Haiber, District Karoli,

Rajasthan, and he stated that on 03.04.2005, the accused Sumran

Singh reached the village and he came to know that Sumran Singh

had got married with the girl, he had brought from Delhi, and he met

the girl and asked her that she was not of marriageable age and

Sumran Singh should not marry her without customary ceremonies.

From the deposition of the aforesaid witness, examined by the


State Vs. Sumran Singh   PS Sultan Puri   FIR No.458/05   1-22
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                           20</span>

accused himself, and from the deposition of the prosecutrix,

discussed above, the prosecution has been able to establish clearly

that accused was having intention or knowledge, while kidnapping the

prosecutrix, that she would be compelled to marry against her will and

she would also be forced to illicit intercourse.                 Consequently,

prosecution has been able to make out a case U/s 366 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_15">IPC</a>.

</p><p id="p_44">34.     Regarding the offence U/s 376 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_16">IPC</a>, the prosecutrix in her

cross-examination admitted that they stayed at Bharatpur for about

two days and also at Jaipur for about 2-3 days at different hotels, and

she did not make any complaint to anyone against the forcible

physical relationship, carried out by the accused with her at any of the

hotels or any other place. She further stated that she did not make

any complaint against her marriage to anyone, and that she did not

contact her mama at Jaipur. She has further deposed that accused

purchased her new clothes and those dresses are with the police.

</p><p id="p_45">35.     From the photographs of the marriage of the prosecutrix,, filed

on the record, which she had admitted in her cross-examination, it


State Vs. Sumran Singh   PS Sultan Puri   FIR No.458/05   1-22
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                           21</span>

does not appear that the prosecutrix was under any duress or

coercion, as the said photographs does not depict such a picture from

a mere glance at them. From the overall evaluation of the evidence of

PW2, regarding the rape allegations, it appears that the prosecutrix

was the consenting party through out in the act of sexual intercourse,

as her age has been held to be more than 16 years at the time of

incident i.e 17 years.
</p>
<p id="p_46">36.     Therefore, her age was such that she could have been a

consenting party for the sexual intercourse. The said influence can

be clearly drawn from the conduct of the prosecutrix, as the

prosecutrix had got umpteen number of opportunities to raise an

alarm, when the accused had taken her to Bharatpur and Jaipur,

where they had stayed and she could have drawn the attention of the

hotel staff or nearby public persons that the accused had forcibly

raped her, which was not the case and she also admitted that she

went for sight seeing at Bharatpur and Jaipur along with the accused.

Yet, the prosecutrix did not raise any protest to the public at large


State Vs. Sumran Singh   PS Sultan Puri   FIR No.458/05   1-22
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                           22</span>

telling them she had been raped forcibly by the accused. Further, she

also admitted that she went to the court of Jaipur and also signed the

marriage document, Ex.PW2/DA and Ex.PW2/DB and it is common

knowledge that police personnel are always available in abudance in

the court premises along with the lawyers. Consequently, if she had

any grievance with regard to the forcible rape, she would have

definitely ventilated the same in presence of police officials or the

public persons, or the lawyers, which is not the case.                  In these

circumstances, it appears that the prosecutrix was a consenting party

throughout in the sexual act.             Consequently, the prosecution has

failed to make out a case U/s 376 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_17">IPC</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_47">37.     The net result of the aforesaid discussion is that the
prosecution has been able to make out a case, U/s 366 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_18">IPC</a> beyond
any shadow of doubt against the accused Sumran Singh, who stands
convicted accordingly.
