<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT
M.S.A. Siddiqui, J.
</p> 

<p id="p_2">1.     This order shall also govern the disposal of I.A. Nos. 686/95,  693/95 and 696/95 in Suit Nos. 1440/94, 1439/94, 1441/94 respectively.  
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.   By  this petition under <a href="/doc/811701/" id="a_1">Section 20</a> of the Arbitration Act,  the  petitioner  seeks  directions  to the respondents to  file  original  agreement before  the Court and to appoint an Arbitrator to adjudicate upon the  disputes  which have arisen between the parties in respect of the said  agree-ment.  The respondents have filed the application under Order 7,  Rule  11, CPC for rejection of the petition on the ground that there is no valid  and binding contract between the parties.  
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.   Facts relevant and requisite for the purpose of deciding the  application under Order 7, Rule 11, CPC lie in a narrow compass. By the collaboration  agreement  dated 26.6.1992, the respondents agreed  to  grant  mining lease  to the petitioner after obtaining the requisite  statutory  approval under M.P. Minor Minerals Rules from the Competent Authority. As per  terms of  the agreement, the petitioner paid a sum of Rs. 2,47,000/- to  the  respondents.  The  petitioner  also incurred  expenditure  amounting  to  Rs. 12,45,978/-  in mobilising machinery, labour and equipment for  undertaking mining operations. However, the performance of the contract became impossible  as  the respondents were restrained by the  Competent  Authority  from entering  into collaboration agreement with the petitioner. The  petitioner demanded  refund of the amount paid by the petitioner but the  said  demand did not invoke any response from the respondents. 
</p> 

<p id="p_5">4.   The question is : whether there is a sub sifting and valid arbitration 
agreement between the parties? Learned Counsel for the respondents contended  that  according  to the petitioner's own showing  the  agreement  dated 26.6.1992  is void ab initio and so the arbitration clause cannot  operate, for  on this view the clause itself is also void. Learned Counsel  for  the respondents  have invited my attention to the following averments  made  in paragraphs 7, 8 and 11 of the petition: 
</p><p id="p_6">BLOCKQUOTE&gt; 
 

     "7.  That plaintiff also mobilised its machinery, men and  equipment for undertaking operations under the agreement entered  into by  defendants.  Plaintiff  incurred Rs. 12,45,978/-  by  way  of expenditure  in  mobilisation of above, in question  as  also  of other  Associates  of defendants, holding similar  leases,  under similar  agreements  with plaintiff. The agreement was  found  as non-workable  in  view  of  defendants  prohibited/debarred  from entering into collaboration agreement with plaintiff, for  allow-ing plaintiff to start operation of quarries in its own name  and the  quarry  held by defendants not giving a  yield  to  required quality  and size of blocks assured by defendants and as  desired by plaintiff. 
</p> 

<p id="p_7">     8.  That plaintiff required defendants to refund  amounts received by  them  from the plaintiff and to reimburse plaintiff  for  the monies  spent  in pursuance of agreement. Defendants  failed  and neglected  to  respond  to plaintiff's  requests,  reminders  and demands,  leading to following disputes arising between the  par-ties: 
</p> 

<p id="p_8">     (a) The legality, validity and effect of Collaboration  Agreemententered  into between the parties in terms of enforceability  and voidness thereof. 
</p> 

<p id="p_9">     (b)  Plaintiff's entitlement to secure refund of amounts paid  to defendants and for reimbursement of expenses incurred besides the commercial  loss suffered by acting upon representations  of  defendants. 
</p> 

<p id="p_10">     The disputes and plaintiff's entitlements thereunder are set  out in Annexure 'A' hereto. 
</p> 

<p id="p_11">     11...Cause of action arose to plaintiff upon representations made by  defendants being found to be illegal, the subject  matter  of agreement  between the parties being found to be against law  and purpose of agreement being rendered void..." 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_12">5.   Thus,  according  to the petitioner's own  showing  the  collaboration agreement  dated 26.6.1992 is void ab initio. Now the question is:  Whether an  arbitration  clause can be invoked in the case of a  dispute  under  an invalid contract? It is well settled that if a contract is void ab  initio, the  arbitration  clause  being a component part of  the  contract,  cannot operate  on disputes under such contract, for its operative  force  depends upon  the  existence of the contract and its validity Union  of  India  Vs. Kishori  Lal, . I, therefore, find and hold that the  petitioner is not entitled to invoke arbitration clause of the agreement  dated 26.6.1992, which has no legal existence. 
</p> 

<p id="p_13">6.   For the foregoing reasons, the petition under <a href="/doc/811701/" id="a_2">Section 20</a> of the  Arbitration Act is rejected. No order as to costs. 
</p>
