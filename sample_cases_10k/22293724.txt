(BY SRI. D. NAGARAJ, AGA)

     THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">ARTICLE 226</a> OF
THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, PRAYING TO QUASH THE
GOVERNMENT ORDER DATED 01.10.2012 AT ANNEXURE - A
PASSED BY THE R-1 IN SO FAR AS IT RELATES TO THE
PETITIONER AND ETC.,.

     THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR DICTATING JUDGMENT
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                              ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      The petitioner was dismissed from service by the order

dated 1.10.2012 against which this writ petition is filed with a

prayer to quash the same and to reinstate him into service with

all consequential benefits.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      2. A complaint was made by one K M Asif Ahmed against

the petitioner alleging that the petitioner demanded Rs.15 lakhs

from him to favour a case in O S No.394/2006 pending on the

file of the court in which the petitioner was the Presiding Officer.

The learned District Judge, D K, Mangalore recorded statement

of the complainant and also obtained affidavit. The complaint

itself has been taken on record and departmental enquiry was

initiated. Before initiation of regular enquiry, a discrete enquiry

was conducted and it was opined that there is a case made out
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span>


for initiation of regular enquiry. Accordingly, enquiry was

initiated and enquiry officer was appointed. On the basis of the

complaint and discrete enquiry, the Disciplinary Authority framed

articles of charges in D I No.1/2010 on 30.7.2010. Along with

the charge sheet list of witnesses and list of documents were

furnished to the petitioner.        Statement of imputation of

misconduct     was   also    supplied.   The     petitioner   made

representation and sought to drop the enquiry proceedings

against him.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      3. The complainant has stated in his complaint dated

15.8.2009 that he had filed O S No.394/2006. It was pending for

the last 3 years and in September, 2008 he got a call from one

Mr.Shafi and informed to have a talk with Shafi and pursuant to

the same he went to the place where Shafi was sitting in a

Santro Car No.KA 19 Z 6477. He told him to sit in the car and

asked about pendency of the case. He further told that the

petitioner was the Judicial Officer, he was his close friend and he

would do some favour provided he pays some amount. On the

same evening, again he received a call.        Thereafter, he went
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      4</span>


there and saw the petitioner who was sitting in the tinted Honda

SUV Car with registration NO.KA 19 6477. Shafi introduced the

complainant to the Judge and Judge told the complainant that if

he wants to finish the case fast, he has to pay Rs.15 lakhs.


</p><p id="p_6">       4. The prosecution has examined the complainant as PW-1

and PW-2 to PW-6 are the practicing advocates of Mangalore of

which PW-2 is its President and PW-7 was the Principal District

Judge, who recorded the statement of the complainant and PW-8

the Vigilance Registrar and PW-9 is the Police Inspector attached

to the High Court Vigilance Office. On behalf of the petitioner,

himself     was     examined   and       he   has    not    examined    any

independent witness and marked Ex.D1 to Ex.D15 on his behalf.




</p><p id="p_7">       5.     The Enquiry Officer after examining the respective

case of the parties held that Articles of Charges have been

proved.      The     High   Court        Committee-I        examined    the

case      papers     and    recommended             the     case   of   the

petitioner    for     maximum       punishment.           The   same    was

placed before the Full Court and the Full Court concurred

with it.   Later on recommendation was forwarded to His

Excellency Governor, who passed an order dated 1.10.2012

exercising the power under Rule 8(viii) of K C S (C.C.A) Rules

and imposed a penalty of dismissal from service and suspension

period was treated as suspension and dismissal was with effect

from the same.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">     6. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the

prosecution has not proved the case.      He alleged mala fides

against the complainant.   The High Court Committee has not

applied its mind while imposing the maximum punishment on

the petitioner. The complaint does show that complainant was

informed over phone in September, 2008 and he was called to

meet, accordingly he met, Shafi in turn told in respect of a case

in O S No.394/2006 in which the petitioner was the Presiding

Officer, if it is to be made in favour of the complainant, he can

make arrangement for discussion with the Presiding Officer and

on the same day he made arrangement, consequently he

introduced the petitioner who made a demand for Rs.15 lakhs in

order to make a favour. As per the complaint itself, this was in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      6</span>


September        2008   where   as   the    complaint     was   made     on

15.8.2009 about a year thereafter. This long delay has not been

explained by the prosecution. It is his case that the complainant

waited one year and not explaining the delay, it gives scope for

malice suspecting the integrity of the complainant.


</p><p id="p_10">       7.   In    the   case   pending     before   the   petitioner,   the

complainant made I A for amendment. The same was dismissed

by the order dated 03.04.2009.              The same was challenged

before this Court in W P No.10882-85/2009. The writ petitions

were   dismissed and order           passed    by the     petitioner    was

confirmed.       On dismissal of the writ petitions, the complainant

preferred this complaint in September 2008.           The motive behind

the complaint is dismissal of the writ petitions by confirming the

order passed by the petitioner. This shows, the complainant has

not made a bonafied complaint and it is only made out of malice

against this petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">       8. Three charges have been framed against the petitioner.

But none of the charges have been proved since none of the

witnesses who have been examined by the prosecution have

 court order dated
 09.08.2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 7</span>


supported the case of the complainant.      The evidence of PW-1

who is the complainant is unbelievable.     He has stated in the

complaint, there was demand made by the Presiding Officer on

15.8.2008 and complaint has been made after a gap of an year,

that too after dismissal of his writ petition before this Court. In

the complaint he has stated Shafi called him. Shafi has not been

examined. He has stated in the complaint about the car no. in

which the petitioner was sitting. But he has not made available

any document, whether the said vehicle either belongs to Shafi

or anybody else. The owner of the car has not been examined.


</p><p id="p_13">      9. The other prosecution witnesses namely PW-2 to PW-6

they are in no way material witnesses to the case. Their views is

stated to have been recorded by the Vigilance Registrar as part

of discrete enquiry. They have stated to the Vigilance Officer

about suspecting integrity of the petitioner and none of these

prosecution witnesses spoke anything about the demand made

or their evidence supports the case of PW-1.      Hence it is the

submission that including PW-1 the prosecution witnesses PW-2

to PW-6 have not supported the case of the prosecution.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  8</span>


Absolutely, there is no iota of evidence available in favour of the

prosecution to prove the case.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">       10. PW-7 who is the Principal District Judge, recorded the

statement of PW-1 on 12.10.2009.        PW-8 was the Registrar

Vigilance, who did not conduct discrete enquiry. PW-8 has only

produced the       documents   and statement recorded by the

predecessor. Hence PW-8 is not a material witness to the case.


</p><p id="p_16">       11. PW-9 who has conducted discrete enquiry, whose

services were attached to the office of the Registrar Vigilance.

PW-9 enquired about the incident and not recorded any

statement.      The learned counsel submitted that none of the

prosecution witnesses supported the case of the prosecution and

they are not material witnesses, even then the Enquiry Officer

relied upon their evidence for passing the impugned order. The

report of the enquiry officer to the extent charges leveled

against the petitioner are proved is totally baseless and the

same should have been taken in favour of the petitioner by

acquitting the petitioner from the charges.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 9</span>


</p><p id="p_17">      12. It is further submitted that the charges framed are as

vague as they could be.      They do not spell out the specific

instance and case pertaining to the misconduct.       The vague

charges deprived opportunity to the petitioner to disprove case

of the prosecution. On this sole ground only the impugned order

is liable to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">      13. It is submitted, since from the date of appointment,

the petitioner served with utmost honesty and integrity. There

is no occasion to suspect his integrity. The confidential reports

of the petitioner between 10.2.2004 and 26.8.2009 there is a

positive report and he was also issued appreciation letter

appreciating his services.   The respondent has not applied its

mind and mechanically passed the impugned order.       Once the

confidential report comes good and appreciation letter is issued,

despite the same, dismissing the petitioner from service is

arbitrary and illegal. The evidence of PW-2 to PW-6 are either

hearsay and it shall be taken as no evidence since they do not

make any positive evidence of the prosecution.      The Judicial

Officers who have no protection, if they are not protected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                 10</span>


against unscrupulous complaints, it is very difficult for them to

discharge their duties.      Before framing the charges, the

Disciplinary Authority should have dropped the case for want of

sufficient material to frame the charges.


</p><p id="p_20">      14. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits

that detailed representation has been made pursuant to the

second show cause notice and sufficient instances have been

highlighted. It should have been examined thoroughly meeting

each and every instance, but while imposing punishment, none

of the circumstances or defences are highlighted.     This itself

shows, the respondent has passed the order without application

of mind in a mechanical way. In this regard, the learned counsel

places reliance on (2001) 6 SCC 491 Para-10 (<a href="/doc/650916/" id="a_2">P C Joshi v. State

of U.P &amp; others</a>).
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">      15. The learned Government Advocate submitted to

dismiss the petition. Petitioner has got a history of misconduct.

Earlier he was working as A.P.P and on the complaint enquiry

was initiated. The enquiry is challenged and it is pending in W P

No.17658/2010.      The complainant Asif who made a written
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                 11</span>


complaint and whose statement is also recorded by PW-7. The

complaint and the statement read together give lot of scope for

specific case against the petitioner.   The complaint has been

referred to the High Court and in turn the Vigilance Registrar

held a discrete enquiry. During discrete enquiry, the statements

were recorded of the advocates who practiced before the

petitioner. It is the statement of the advocates that the

petitioner is not a worthy man whose behaviour is of suspecting

nature.   Those advocates have been examined in the enquiry

and they have also been cross-examined.        In their chief and

cross they support the case of the prosecution.         It is his

submission that PW-1 has reiterated the complaint averments

and statement recorded and he was called on his mobile. Shafi

informed the complainant to make arrangement to meet the

Judicial Officer.   In the evening, he went and met the Judicial

officer and petitioner himself made a demand of Rs.15 lakhs.

This piece of evidence is to be taken serious note and that has

been considered by the Vigilance officer and also Committee

No.I, Full Court has applied its mind and it was resolved to

dismiss the petitioner, the same was recommended to His
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                12</span>


Excellency Governor, who confirmed the order dismissing the

petitioner from service. There is application of mind in passing

the impugned order.     The petitioner was not required in the

judicial services which is unique in nature and cannot be

compared to any other services in the State.


</p><p id="p_23">     16.    The   learned    Government        Advocate    submits,

sufficiency, relevancy and reliability of evidence cannot        be

reviewed by the High Court in the writ petition.          Subjective

satisfaction of the witnesses and their evidence was taken note

by the Enquiry officer and in turn has been examined by the

High Court Committee No.I and also Full Court and there is

nothing open for this Court to re-appreciate. In this regard, the

learned Government Advocate placed reliance on the judgment

reported in AIR 1965 SC 1103 Paragraphs 7 to 10 (<a href="/doc/1880253/" id="a_3">State of

Madras v. G Sundaram</a>), (1998) 2 SCC 394 Para 2 to 4

(<a href="/doc/1869230/" id="a_4">Commissioner &amp; Secretary to the Govt. &amp; Others v. C

Shanmugam</a>), (2003) 9 SCC 191 Para 5 (<a href="/doc/693281/" id="a_5">Sub-Divisional Officer,

Konch vs., Maharaj Singh</a>) and it is his submission that this

Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> has supervisory power and not an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                  13</span>


appellate power.   The petitioner himself has not questioned or

complained the procedural aspects in the enquiry.        As long as

the procedure was not complained, it is presumed enquiry

proceedings went in accordance with provisions and punishment

it is for the Appointing Authority. Hence it is not open for this

Court to sit over the decision as an appellate authority.


</p><p id="p_24">      17. In response to enquiry report, second show cause

notice was issued to the petitioner. The petitioner in response to

the second show cause notice has given a detailed reply and the

said reply has been thoroughly considered by the Committee and

the Appointing Authority, the Chief Justice.           The learned

Government Advocate also placed reliance on the decision

reported in (1997) 6 SCC 339 calcicum (a) to (h) (High court of

Judicature at Bombay through its <a href="/doc/763434/" id="a_7">Registrar v. Shirishkumar

Rangrao Patil &amp; another</a>).
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">      18. The learned Government Advocate submits that the

enqujiry is fair and proper since the petitioner has not

complained the procedure adopted in the enquiry. The learned

Government     Advocate     by   referring   the   resolution   dated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                          14</span>


14.7.2012 submits that the Full Court considered the resolution

dated 6.6.2012 of Administrative Committee No.I, Articles of

Charges, evidence recorded by the Enquiry Officer in respect of

Charges No.1 to 3.           It was resolved to accept the findings

recorded by the Enquiry Officer on Charges No.1 to 3 against the

delinquent officer.       It is submitted, resolution of the Full Court

shows that the Full Court has considered all the aspects of case

of the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_27">

</p><p id="p_28">        19. Heard the learned counsel on both sides.


        The submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner

that    the   charges     framed     against       him    are   vague.       The

complainant has made a statement which was recorded by PW7,

wherein he has stated that the complaint is dated 15.08.2009.

That    during     September       2008       he    has    received      a   call

from one Shafi.         In response to the said call he met Shafi

on the same day by evening when he met, the complainant

the car by the side of the driver.                 Then the petitioner told

complainant bearing O.S.No.394/2006 which is being posted

before the delinquent judicial officer who is the petitioner herein,

but it can be solved, if some amount is paid.       Then they told

him to pay Rupees Fifteen Lakhs as fee. The incident according

to the complainant it was happened in September 2008.            He

lodged a complaint on 15.08.2009, waiting for nearly one year.

This period has not been explained by the prosecution and

complainant has stated that he went to the spot he found the

petitioner in a black Honda SUV vehicle which bearing No.6477

belonging to Mr. Shafi. The gist of this complaint though it is

reflected in the charge sheet but does not give any particulars as

to when the petitioner was met by the complainant.




</p><p id="p_29">       20.    The second charge is that a discreet enquiry was

conducted by the Registrar (Vigilance), High Court of Karnataka

on 03.09.2009 among the Advocates including President, District

Bar Association, Mangalore.       It revealed that petitioner had

failed to maintain integrity, impartiality and reputation in

discharging his judicial functions   which is against the service

jurisprudence.   This   charge is as vague as it could be.     The

enquiry was initiated at the instance of the complaint made by

the complainant who is PW1 on 15.08.2009. The complaint is

very silent. There is   no reference made about conduct of the

petitioner. Along with the charge sheet, though it consists list of

documents, but for the purpose of proving charge No.2, there

are no materials produced and made available and therefore, it

will be very difficult for any person to understand the words 'to

maintain integrity, impartiality and good reputation in discharge

of judicial duty'.   In support of the same as the petitioner

submitted that he has served for more than 15 years and

especially in the year 2008-09 he has received appreciation

letter from the High Court of Karnataka. When the things stood

like this, when there is no adverse findings in his confidential

records against him, that    itself shows that the petitioner had

maintained integrity impartiality and good reputation. If it was

the case of the prosecution that when the petitioner was serving

in Mangalore as a Senior Civil Judge, if the allegations were

made to the said particular period, then        specific allegation

should have been reflected in the charges. But, reading of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                     17</span>


  charge No.2, it is very vague, no materials are produced along

  with   the   witnesses.      Ordinarily,     anybody/nobody      could

  understand     the   words   "integrity     impartiality   and   good

  reputation". Though it could be understood in general sense the

  question comes in respect of which proceedings the petitioner

  has not maintained integrity, impartiality and not maintained

  good reputation.      To maintain good reputation is a general

  observation because during entire service, he has not received

  any adverse remarks. On the other hand, an appreciation letter

  has been received for the work he has rendered. When charge

  sheet is framed it should be specific and apt. Therefore, in the

  charge sheet, the particular date of incident, case number to

  some extent it should have been mentioned. But I find

  absolutely no such reference made in respect of charge No.2.

  Hence it is a vague charge. In         my view, framing charges is a

  basis for initiating enquiry. When charge itself is very vague and

  its furtherance is also bad in law, since it has been furthered on

  the basis of the vague charges.

</p><p id="p_31">       21.   In respect of charge No.3, though discreet enquiry

conducted by the inspector of police: Vigilance Cell who is CW11,

he has been examined as PW9.         It is stated that "petitioner was

in the habit of visiting the properties involved in the civil suits

and delivering the judgments and the petitioner said to be

having nexus with some real estate agents". This charge No.3 is

also without any particulars. It does not disclose anything in

fact, it hides all the particulars which should have been made

available to the petitioner. It is the charge that petitioner used

to visit the property involved in the civil suits.      The   judicial

officers would be normally posted to a particular place for a

period of three years. The incident has happened in the middle

of the said period. If it is the case of PW9 that the petitioner had

visited some of the properties in respect of a particular suit, then

properties number or the suit nos. where the respective

properties are involved should have been referred. But no such

particulars are found in charge No.3. Therefore it is also a vague

one.   The vague is nothing but a vague. The petitioner in his

defence has stated that charges are vague and he has pleaded

to drop the proceedings. But it has not been done by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                     19</span>


prosecution. Hence I hold that charges framed against the

petitioner are vague. Hence enquiry proceedings suffers.


</p><p id="p_32">     22.    Secondly, prosecution in order to prove the charges

has examined in all 9 witnesses of which PW1 is the complainant

himself. The complaint it is already referred that complaint is

filed nearly after a year.        The complainant had made IA for

amendment      which    was       dismissed    by   the   petitioner     on

03.04.2009.      This       was   challenged   before     this   court   in

W.P.No.10882-885/2009 it also came to be dismissed by

confirming the order passed by the petitioner on 14.08.2009.

The significance of this date is that when the petitioner

dismissed the amendment application filed by the complainant

on 03.04.2009,     he could have filed the complaint because on

that day itself he had the knowledge about the call made by one

Shafi. He met the petitioner in September 2008 but he failed to

make a complaint on the same day or the next day thereafter.

But the complainant has made a complaint only after dismissal

of the writ petitions referred to above by this court.           Then the

complainant must have realized about the attempt made by the

complaint and complaint is made in September 2008. This shows

malice in lodging the complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_33">     23.    PW7 is the District Judge then.   In his evidence he

has averred that the complainant reiterated the contents of

complaint, but Shafi has not been examined.       Further in his

evidence PW1 has referred that one Shakeel Mahar an advocate

is informed about the call made by Shafi in September 2008 and

Shafi has informed him about the conduct of petitioner who is

making demand and corrupt practice. In order to substantiate

the said allegation, Shakeel Mahar was not examined. More than

that if the evidence of PW1 is scrutinized in the light of the

charges,   he has deposed in his cross-examination which is

available in internal page No.9 that:-

Though PW1        to some        extent, supports        the   case   of the

Lakhs in order to allow the suit in O.S.No.349/2006.                  If the

about the public information. This piece of evidence cannot be

person, always it should be specific and apt and utmost,

particulars have to be furnished.    They are nothing but only

allegations. This evidence of PW2 has been taken for framing of

<p id="p_47">This evidence of PW2 discloses that he had some hearsay

discussions with his colleagues and he was not having first hand

knowledge and no incidents were happened and no materials or

complaints       are placed before the enquiry officer in order to

substantiate charge No.2. It is very pertinent to refer that this

delinquent officer has to function in respect of many cases. For

instance, for advocates, there may be a single case before the

officer but the officer has more than 50 to 100 cases daily. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                   26</span>


result would be either this side or that side and the person to the

lis the case he has chances of making some allegations. It is

very difficult to accept the materials and exact transactions and

complaints in respect of allegations of corrupt practice but when

one makes an allegation against the particular officer, if it is

proved, it takes his life as an officer. Here, I find that enquiry

officer has relied on the evidence of PW2 though it is very utterly

no evidence to prove charge No.2. Further the evidence of PW2

to 6 it is only in respect of charge No.2 and not against charge

No.1. Charge No.1 is by PW1 he has strenuously stated that he

has made a complaint after the lapse of nearly one year that too

after the interlocutory application before the delinquent judicial

officer was dismissed on 03.04.2009 and the same was

challenged before the High Court and the High Court also

dismissed the writ petitions on 14.08.2009.          Then he filed a

complaint on 15.08.2009.        These are all things if they are

considered to get the life of the judicial officer it is very difficult

for the said officer to perform his duty.

PWs 2 to 6.        PW8 is the Vigilance Officer who produced

documents from the office of the Registrar(Vigilance). In the

circumstances,     none     of   the    prosecution   witnesses   have

petitioner. PW9 who is a police officer who is attached to the

Vigilance Department he has collected information from the Bar

recorded prior to that one in the discreet enquiry is of no use,

unless it is spotted and marked as a          document in the     later

enquiry. Though PW2 to 6 have been examined, their evidence

is only hearsay and without having any specific personal

knowledge and hence their evidence is of no use.

</p><p id="p_63">       37.    Considering all these things, the delinquent judicial

officer has deposed as DW1 he deposed that he is innocent, he

has not made any demand to the complainant. To say so, the

delinquent judicial officer has put-forth his service records. Then

the burden is automatically shifted on the prosecution to prove

all the allegations/charges.    But the prosecution has taken it

lightly.

nature, where an enquiry is held against any judicial officer, the

prosecution shall take much more care in proving the case. May

be it is the Vigilance Officer or the Police Inspector attached to

the Vigilance Department, the prosecution should have taken all

possible steps in producing the relevant documents and the

evidence to prove the case. But here, no such attempt is made

by the prosecution.

Registrar Vigilance who produced documents, PW9 is the police

officer     attached to Vigilance Department.      Therefore, the

evidences of PW2 to 9 is of no use or avail to prove the case of

the prosecution and PW1 evidence is truly       unreliable as it is

made after a gap of nearly one year that too after the dismissal

of the writ petitions on 14.08.2009. In considering all the facts

narrated above, this court is of the opinion that the enquiry

officer has filed and committed an error in holding all the

charges are proved.

this High court is not a court of appeal it is only exercising a

supervisory power and in support of his submission he relied on

judgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (1997) 6 SCC

339 in the case of High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Through

its Registrar Vs. Shirishkumar Rangrao Patil and Another, AIR

1965 SCC 1103 (V 52 C 176) between "The State of Madras Vs.

allegation that he is involved in creating scene in indulging

corrupt practices these are of very serious nature, when there is

serious allegation, there should have been a serious effort by the

prosecution to prove the case.       Though, this court is not of

appeal but this court should take all possible steps to see that

immediately, forthwith and if it is found, there is a failure on the

part of the prosecution, that should be corrected.
