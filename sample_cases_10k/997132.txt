<div class="doc_title">Manoj Kumar vs State Of U.P. on 25 January, 2010</div><pre id="pre_1">Court No. - 51
Case :- CRIMINAL MISC. BAIL APPLICATION No. - 1833 of 2010
Petitioner :- Manoj Kumar
Respondent :- State Of U.P.
Petitioner Counsel :- S.K. Pathak
Respondent Counsel :- Govt Advocate
Hon'ble Shashi Kant Gupta,J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Heard learned counsel for the applicants, learned A.G.A. and perused the
record.
</p><p id="p_2">It is submitted by learned counsel for the applicant that the applicant is
innocent and has been falsely implicated. It is further submitted that according
to the medical report the age of the girl is 19 years and no definite opinion
regarding rape has been given by the doctor. It is further submitted that the
FIR was lodged on 25 -5-2009 in which the applicant was not named. It is
further submitted that the name of the applicant was disclosed in the statement
recorded under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_1">section 164</a> Cr.P.C. It is further submitted that the prosecutrix
has changed her version in the statement recorded under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_2">section 164</a> Cr.P.C.
under the pressure of her family members and has falsely implicated the
applicant. It is further submitted that the applicant remained for few months
along with the co- accused, as such it cannot be said that she was not the
consenting party.. It is further submitted that the applicant does not have any
criminal history. The applicant is in Jail since 16-12-2009. There is scanty
chance of his fleeing away from the judicial process or tampering with the
prosecution evidence. Thus he is entitled to be released on bail
Keeping in view the nature of the offence, evidence, complicity of the
accused ,severity of punishment and submissions of the learned counsel for
the parties, I am of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail

Let the applicant Manoj Kumar involved in Case crime no.109 of 2009

district Agra be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond and two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Court concerned with
the following conditions:
