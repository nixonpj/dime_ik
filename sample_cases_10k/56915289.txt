</pre>

<p id="p_1">                                  This Civil Miscellaneous Appeal has been filed by the

                      appellant Insurance Company against the award, dated 27.04.2015,

                      made in M.C.O.P.No.373 of 2013, passed by the Motor Accidents

                      Claims Tribunal (Subordinate Judge), Kulithalai.



</p><p id="p_2">                                  2. The appellant is the second respondent in M.C.O.P.No.

                      373 of 2013. The first respondent, who is the claimant, filed a claim

                      petition claiming a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- as compensation for the

                      injuries sustained by him in the accident that occurred on

                      30.08.2009. According to the first respondent, on 30.08.2009 while

                      he was getting down from the bus belonging to the second

                      respondent, the driver of bus suddenly started the bus at a high

                      speed without noticing that the first respondent was getting down

                      from the bus. Due to the same, the first respondent fell down and

                      sustained injuries.   According to the first respondent, the accident

                      occurred only due to the negligence of the driver of the bus

                      belonging to the second respondent insured with the appellant. The

                      first respondent was aged 27 years at the time of accident and was

                      working as Painter and was earning a sum of Rs.8,000/- per month.

                      Due to the injuries, he was not able to do any work as he was doing

                      before the accident.    Hence, he filed a claim petition against the

                      appellant   and   the    second    respondent    claiming   a   sum    of

                      Rs.10,00,000/- as compensation.

<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">                                  3.The second respondent remained ex-parte before the

                      Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">                                  4.The appellant filed counter statement and contended

                      that the accident did not occur due to the negligence of the driver of

                      the bus belonging to the second respondent. The first respondent

                      was trying to get down from the moving bus and fell down.             The

                      accident did not occur in the bus stop, but it happened in the middle

                      of the road. At the time of accident, the driver of the bus did not

                      possess valid driving licence to drive the bus. The bus had no valid

                      registration certificate and FC. The first respondent did not suffer

                      injuries and disability as alleged in the petition.



</p><p id="p_7">                                  5. Before the Tribunal, the first respondent examined

                      himself as P.W.1 and one Dr.Selvaraj was examined as P.W.2 and

                      marked 5 documents as Exs.P.1 to P.5. The appellant examined one

                      Murugesan as R.W.1. One document was marked as Ex.X1.



</p><p id="p_8">                                  6. The Tribunal considering the pleadings, oral and

                      documentary evidence held that the accident occurred only due to

                      the rash and negligent driving by driver of the bus and directed the

                      appellant to pay compensation on behalf of the second respondent

                      to the first respondent. By applying multiplier method awarded a

                      sum of Rs.8,87,400/- as compensation to the first respondent.



</p><p id="p_9">                                  7.Aggrieved by the said award, the appellant Insurance

                      Company has come out with the present appeal.



</p><p id="p_10">                                  8.The learned counsel appearing for the appellant

                      contended that the driver of the bus was examined as R.W.1 and he

                      deposed that the first respondent was under influence of Alcohol

                      and he was in drunken mood. He was sitting on the bonnet of the

                      bus and was creating a problem. At the request of women

                      passengers, the first respondent was made to get down from the

                      bus.   When the R.W.1, the driver of bus started the bus, the first

                      respondent tried to get into the bus and fell down and got injuries.

                      The driver is not responsible for the accident.      The treatment

                      register was summoned and marked as Ex.X1, which shows that the

                      first respondent was under    influence of Alcohol and in drunken

                      mood at the time of accident.   The Tribunal failed to consider the

                      Ex.X1 and evidence of R.W.1 the driver of the bus in proper

                      perspective. The Tribunal erred in applying the multiplier method in

                      awarding compensation. Conviction in Criminal Court will not prove

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                             5</span>

                      the negligence on the part of the driver of the bus.                  The first

                      respondent has himself stated in the claim petition that his age is 27

                      years and the Tribunal erred in fixing the age of the first respondent

                      at   22     years    and   applied   multiplier   of   '18'   while   awarding

                      compensation. The Tribunal failed to deduct the standard deduction

                      as held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the judgment reported in 2011

                      (2) TNMAC 67.          In support of his contention, the learned counsel

                      appearing for the appellant relied on the following Judgments:

                      wherein paragraph No. 11 it has been held as follows:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                      “11. .... However, there is no continuous medical

                                her occupation. Therefore, the appellant/Insurance
                                Company is justified in saying that multiplier method

                              sustained in the accident and on the other hand, in
                              the claim petition as well as in his evidence PW1
                              admitted that even after the accident, he is still
                              working in the same post. But the only grievance of
                              the claimant is that due to the disfigurement, he faces
                              some difficulties in getting promotion and other
                              incentives. Since, it is not a case of loss of
                              employment and loss of earning capacity, in our
                              considered view, the tribunal ought not to have

                      that first respondent was not stable and smelling of alcohol itself will

                      not amount being in drunken mood and unstable.             The learned

                      counsel appearing for the first respondent relied on the following

                      Judgments:

                      (Ker) in the case of P.V. Jose Vs. United India Insurance Company

                      Limited, wherein paragraph No.6 it has been held as follows:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                  “6. The entry made by the Doctor in the wound
                           certificate that smell of alcohol was present in the breath
                           of the Appellant cannot be a reason for finding that he
                           was under the influence of alcohol rendering him unable
                           to keep himself proper and stable and contributing to the
                           cause of accident. Drinking of alcoholic beverages is not
                           a prohibited thing in this democratic country.      But the
                           crucial question is as to whether after drinking alcohol,
                           the appellant had actually contributed to the cause of
                           accident by his deeds while using the road. Here, there
                           is absolutely no evidence to show that he was under the
                           influence of alcohol or he had contributed to the cause of
                           accident. For these reasons, the finding entered by the
                           learned Tribunal that there was contributory negligence
                           on the part of the appellant cannot be accepted. We
                           vacate that finding. Therefore, the deduction of 50% of
                           effected by the Tribunal from the total amount of
                           compensation arrive at is un sustainable. The appellant
                           is entitled to the total amount of compensation arrived at
                           by the Tribunal as well as by this Court.”

                      either side and perused the materials available on record.



</p><p id="p_24">                                 11. The contention of the learned counsel appearing for

                      the appellant is that the first respondent was in a drunken mood

                      and was creating problem in the bus and women passengers

                      complained to the driver and hence, the first respondent was made

                      to get down from the bus.     When the bus started, he tried to get

                      into the bus and he fell down and sustained injuries.                 This

                      contention was not raised in the counter statement.

                      down and sustained injuries. The present contention of the learned

                      counsel appearing for the appellant cannot be entertained as the

                      same was not pleaded in the counter statement. Secondly, no

                      complaint was given by the driver or conductor or any of the

                      passengers against the first respondent.    The two Judgments relied

                      on by the learned counsel for the respondent referred to above, it

                      has been held that consuming      alcohol will not amount to person

                      injured was in drunken mood and not stable. It is for the appellant

                      to prove that the first respondent was not stable due to consuming

                      alcohol. The appellant failed to prove the same. From the ratio of

                      the two Judgments relied on by the counsel for the first respondent,

                      it cannot be said that the first respondent was in drunken mood and

                      was not stable.

                      appearing for the appellant, the Tribunal erred in adopting multiplier

                      method for granting compensation for injured person.        It is also

                      contended that when the injured persons proved his total un-

                      capacitate and    immobilised and     is unable to do work multiplier

                      method can be adopted.      To substantiate the said contention, the

                      learned counsel appearing for the appellant       relied on the two

                      Judgments stated Supra. These Judgments         are not applicable to

                      the facts of the present case.

</p><p id="p_29">                                     14. The first respondent has pleaded that he was

                      incapacitate and is unable to do any work.          He substantiated the

                      said claim by examining PW.2 - Doctor and marking one wound

                      certificate. The appellant has not let in any contra evidence. In such

                      circumstances, multiplier method adopted by the Tribunal is correct

                      and   valid.    The    learned    counsel   appearing   for   the   appellant

                      contended that when the           multiplier method is adopted standard

                      deduction has to be made as per the second schedule of the <a href="/doc/785258/" id="a_3">Motor

                      appearing for the appellant is squarely applicable to the facts of the

                      present case in this regard.
