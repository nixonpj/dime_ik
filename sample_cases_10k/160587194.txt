</pre><p id="p_1">SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, C.J. (ORAL)

          The controversy qua these two tenders has arisen on account of the fact

that the tender floating authority introduced a clause requiring the contractor to

have registered himself with the EPF authorities and, thus, having a code number.

Learned counsels for the respondents do not dispute that in view of the judgement

of the Division Bench of this Court in Ram Singh and others Vs Punjab State
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">             CWP-9726-2013 (O&amp;M)                                                                    2</span>
            CWP-9744-2013 (O&amp;M)


            Cooperative Supply &amp; Marketing Federation Limited and others, 2007 LLJ

            631, the liability towards EPF may not be permissible to be shifted by the

            principal employer being such entities. It is, however, stated that since the

            contractors often keep changing the persons deployed; the details available only

            with the contractors and that is the reason the requirement was put that they are

            registered with the EPF authorities having a code number.

</p><p id="p_2">                               The petitioner had apparently applied for a code number prior to

            submission of the tender seeing that requirement, but left the concerned column

            blank. On the other hand, the other successful tenderers stated that they had

            applied for the code number and their application was pending and copy of that

            application was enclosed. This was the reason that the petitioner was disqualified.

</p><p id="p_3">                                  As of now, all of them are registered with the EPF authorities and

            have code numbers including the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_4">                                  No doubt, there may be some confusion created in the minds of the

            petitioners arising from the judgement in Ram Singh and others' case (supra),

            but once a specific column was included, the least which was required for the

            petitioner was to indicate that he had applied for the code, especially, keeping in

            mind that it is the own case of the petitioner that he had done so in pursuance of

            the NIT. Another aspect which weighs with us is that the tender is valid for one

            year and six months have already lapsed and now we would not like to disturb the

            tender at this stage.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                                  In view of the aforesaid, no directions as prayed for by the

            petitioner, can be granted at this stage.

<p id="p_6">                                  The petition stands accordingly disposed of.
