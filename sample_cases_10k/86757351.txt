<div class="doc_title">Rajeev Kumar @ Junish @ Gunish @ ... vs The State Of Bihar on 9 May, 2008</div><pre id="pre_1">                IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT PATNA
                        Cr.Misc. No.5212 of 2008
             RAJEEV KUMAR @ JUNISH @ GUNISH @ GANESH KUMAR
                                 Versus
                           THE STATE OF BIHAR
                              -----------
</pre><p id="p_1">3   9/5/2008              Heard learned counsel for the petitioner

                and also the learned counsel for the State.

</p><p id="p_2">                           In this case petitioner is an accused for

                the offence under <a href="/doc/764237/" id="a_1">section 394</a> of the Indian Penal

                Code.   It   has       been      submitted    on    behalf     of    the

                petitioner      that     there       is    nothing       against    the

                petitioner      except       a   mobile phone       which      is   only

                link brought by police in course of investigation

                to    connect     him     in      this     case    and    is      wholly

                insufficient to establish his complicity in this

                case. It has further been submitted that a co-

                accused,        namely,          Aditya      Sharma,        who      was

                apprehended at the spot, has already been granted

                bail by this Court in Cr. Misc. No. 9364 of 2007

                vide order dated 23.4.2007.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                           Counsel for the State                 with the help of

                case diary, however, submits that this is case of

                a train robbery and there are materials to show

                the   involvement       of       the petitioner.         He has     also

                explained       that     co-accused          Aditya      Sharma     was

                granted bail because he was initially named in the

                confessional       statement          of     a     co-accused        and

                thereafter he was apprehended.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                           Considering the aforementioned submissions

                and specially the fact that the mobile phone of

                the petitioner, which was issued in his name, has

                been used for threatening the informant and his

                family members saying that no First Information
                Report        should    be      instituted      and    that    the

               petitioner       having      criminal    antecedents    has     not

               even completed a period of one year custody in

               this case, this Court is not inclined to grant him

               bail     at    this    stage.     His    bail   application     is

               therefore       rejected.       The     petitioner    may     renew

               prayer    for    bail     after remaining       in custody     for

               further period of six months.
