<p id="p_1">            Heard both sides.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.    The revision petitioner, who was the first accused stands

concurrently convicted for offences punishable under <a href="/doc/838469/" id="a_1">sections 452</a>, <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_2">324</a>,

<a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_3">323</a> and <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_4">341</a> IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.    The case of the prosecution is that on 13.10.2000 at about

9.30 a.m., in furtherance of their common intention, the 3 accused

persons, including the revision petitioner, trespassed into the house of

PW1 and the first accused wrongfully restrained her and beat her on the

back with a cudgel and threatened to kill her and when PW1 ran out

from the house, the first accused kicked her causing pain.

</p><p id="p_4">      4.    On the side of the prosecution, 7 witnesses were examined

as PWs 1 to 7 and 5 documents were marked as Exts.P1 to P5.

</p><p id="p_5">      5.    After the close of the prosecution evidence, the accused

were questioned under <a href="/doc/886494/" id="a_5">section 313(1)(b)</a> Cr.P.C. with regard to the

incriminating circumstances appearing against them in the evidence for

the prosecution. They denied those circumstances and maintained their

innocence.
</p>
<p id="p_6">Crl.R.P.No.2916/07
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     : 2 :</span>


</p><p id="p_7">       6.    The learned Magistrate after trial, as per judgment dated

29.11.05 found the revision petitioner/1st accused guilty of the aforesaid

offences and imposed the sentence referred to above. The 3rd accused

was acquitted. The second accused had died during trial.

</p><p id="p_8">       7.    Aggrieved by the conviction and sentence, the revision

petitioner preferred an appeal as Crl.Appeal No.1075/05 before the

Additional Sessions Court (Adhoc-II), Ernakulam, which was dismissed

as per judgment dated 24.3.2007. It is the said judgment which is

assailed in this revision.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       8.    Eventhough the learned counsel for the revision petitioner

challenged the conviction recorded against the revision petitioner, I am

not inclined to interfere with the conviction as it is based on the credible

testimony of PW1, the injured, and PW6 who is the mother of PW1. In

the absence of any infirmity in the appreciation of evidence by the courts

below which are the final courts of fact, this court, sitting in the rarefied

revisional jurisdiction, will be loathe to interfere with the said conviction

which is accordingly confirmed.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       9.    What now survives for consideration is the question of

adequacy or otherwise of the sentence imposed on the revision

petitioner.   There was a counter case arising out of the same

occurrence and it ended in acquittal of the accused. There was a long

civil dispute between the parties. The injuries sustained by PW1 as

Crl.R.P.No.2916/07
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    : 3 :</span>


evidenced by Ext.P4 wound certificate show that they are relatively

minor injuries. In the facts and circumstances of the case, I do not think

that the revision petitioner deserves penal servitude by way of

incarceration.    I am of the view that an appropriate fine and

compensation will serve the ends of justice Accordingly, the sentence

imposed on the revision petitioner is set aside and instead he is

sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.4,000/- (Rupees four thousand only) and

on default to pay the fine, to suffer simple imprisonment for one month

under <a href="/doc/838469/" id="a_6">section 452</a> IPC, to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- (Rupees five

thousand only) and on default to pay the fine, to suffer simple

imprisonment for one month under <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_7">section 324</a> IPC and Rs.500/-

(Rupees five hundred only) each for the offences under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_8">sections 323</a>

and <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_9">341</a> IPC and on default to pay the fine, to suffer simple

imprisonment for 15 days for each default. From out of the fine, as and

when realised, a sum of Rs.4,000/- (Rupees four thousand only) shall be

paid to PW1 by way of compensation.           The fine amount shall be

remitted within 45 days.

<p id="p_11">      This revision is disposed of as above.
