CORAM :-
THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE J.R. MIDHA

1.       Whether Reporters of Local papers may          Yes
         be allowed to see the Judgment?

2.       To be referred to the Reporter or not?         Yes

3.       Whether the judgment should be                 Yes
         reported in the Digest?


                           JUDGMENT (Oral)
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.     The appellant has challenged the common award dated

20th March, 2006 passed by the learned Tribunal whereby
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">MAC.APP.Nos.489/2006, 491/2006, 492/2006,         Page 2 of 5</span>
497/2006, 498/2006, 501/2006 and 502/2006
 seven connected claim petitions arising out of the same

accident were allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.     The accident dated 29th January, 1999 resulted in the

injuries to passengers of Tata Sumo out of which one

claimant expired later on. The Tata Sumo was going from

Rajpura to Ambala side on the left side of the G.T. Road. It is

a double road but the right side of the road was closed for

some reason. The offending bus was coming from Ambala

side and was going towards Rajpura side but since the right

side of the road was closed, the bus came on the wrong side

and there was a head on collision between the bus and the

Tata Sumo.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.     The learned Tribunal has held the bus to be rash and

negligent and has passed the award against the appellant

which is under challenge in this appeal.

</p><p id="p_4">4.     The learned counsel for the appellant challenges the

finding of rash and negligent driving of the bus and submits

that the driver of Tata Sumo was negligent.                  Without

prejudice it is submitted that it is a case of composite

negligence of both the vehicles.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.     The    site    plan,    Ex.PW1/A,    and   the   photographs,

Ex.PW1/1, clearly show that the Tata Sumo was on the

correct side of the road and the bus came on the wrong side.

Even if the right side of the road was closed, the driver of the

bus was required to exercise due care and caution by putting

on the head lights and by giving indication to the traffic
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">MAC.APP.Nos.489/2006, 491/2006, 492/2006,                  Page 3 of 5</span>
497/2006, 498/2006, 501/2006 and 502/2006
 coming from the opposite direction.         There is no evidence

that the driver of the bus has put on the head lights or had

given any other indication in this case.      The photographs -

Ex.PW1/1 show the bus to be in the middle of the road which

also points out to the negligence of the bus. Admittedly, the

police has registered the case of rash and negligent driving

against the driver of the bus. In these circumstances, there

is no infirmity in the finding of the learned Tribunal as to the

rash and negligent driving of the appellant's bus. The finding

of the learned Tribunal with respect to the rash and negligent

driving is upheld.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.     The amount awarded by the learned Tribunal is just,

fair and reasonable and does not call for any interference.

</p><p id="p_7">7.     For the aforesaid reasons, all the seven appeals as well

as all the pending applications are dismissed.

</p><p id="p_8">8.     The appellant has deposited the entire award amount

along with interest with the learned Tribunal in terms of the

order dated 29th May, 2006 out of which 75% of the award

amount has been released to the claimants and the

remaining 25% of the award amount is kept in fixed deposit.

</p><p id="p_9">9.     Since the appeals have been dismissed, the learned

Tribunal is directed to release the balance 25% of the award

amount along with up to date interest to the claimants in

terms of the award within a period of two weeks.

</p><p id="p_10">10.    After the satisfaction of the entire award, both the

parties shall file an affidavit of satisfaction of the award
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">MAC.APP.Nos.489/2006, 491/2006, 492/2006,              Page 4 of 5</span>
497/2006, 498/2006, 501/2006 and 502/2006
 whereupon the Registry shall release the statutory amount

back to the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_11">11.    Copy of this order be given 'Dasti' to learned counsel

for both the parties under signatures of Court Master.

</p><p id="p_12">12.    List for compliance on 28th August, 2009.




</p><p id="p_13">                                                   J.R. MIDHA, J
