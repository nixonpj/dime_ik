CORAM:- HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE JAISHREE THAKUR

Present:    Mr. Amit Chaudhary, Advocate
            for the petitioner.

            Mr. A.S. Dhalial, DAG, Punjab.

            Mr. K. Arun Singh, Advocate,
            for respondent No.2.

JAISHREE THAKUR, J. (Oral)

<p id="p_1">            This petition has been filed under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of the Code of

Criminal Procedure seeking for quashing of FIR No. 23 dated 31.1.2016

registered under <a href="/doc/619940/" id="a_2">Sections 363</a> and <a href="/doc/1559723/" id="a_3">366-A</a> IPC at Police Station Nihal Singh

Wala, District Moga, and all subsequent proceedings arising therefrom in

view of the compromise (Annexure P/3).
</p>
<p id="p_2">            The FIR was registered on the statement of complainant--

Mangal Singh. It is averred that now with the intervention of respectable

persons, the matter has been amicably compromised between the parties and

they have resolved their disputes and differences. In fact, the daughter of the

complainant, namely Rajji Kaur and the petitioner--Gurpreet Singh @

Fauji are living together as husband and wife.

            Keeping in view the fact that the parties have entered into a

compromise, they were directed to appear before learned trial court for

getting their statements recorded in support of the compromise. In pursuance

of the direction, a report     has been received from the Sub Divisional

Judicial Magistrate, Nihal Singh Wala, stating that the compromise arrived

at between the parties is without any pressure or coercion from any one and

the same is genuine one.
</p>
<p id="p_5">            Learned Deputy Advocate General, Punjab, on instructions

from the Investigating Officer and learned counsel for the complainant-

respondent No.2 admit the factum of compromise and submit that in case the

parties have indeed settled their dispute, the State would have no objection

to the quashing of the FIR, in view of the law laid down by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">            I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have also gone

through the record.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            In a decision, based on compromise, none of the parties is a

loser. Rather, a compromise not only brings peace and harmony between the

parties to a dispute, but also restores tranquility in the society. After

considering the nature of offences allegedly committed and the fact that both

the parties have amicably settled their dispute, continuance of criminal

prosecution would be an exercise in futility, as the chances of ultimate

conviction are bleak.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            Consequently, keeping in view the fact that the dispute has been

amicably settled and in view of the law laid by the Hon'ble Supreme Court

in Gian Singh Versus State of Punjab and another, 2012 (4) RCR (Cr.) 543,

this petition is allowed and FIR No. 23 dated 31.1.2016 registered under
