             of cow has not been prepared. Moreover, para 2 of the case diary

             reveals that altogether ten empty including live cartridges were

<p id="p_63">                              Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, Shashi

             Shankar Mishra submits that one co-accused, namely, Rupesh

             Mishra, against whom there is allegation of causing firearm injury

             to injured Mantu Yadav, has already been granted privilege of bail

             by the learned court below itself on the ground of alibi and the

             case of the petitioners, Shashi Shankar Mishra, Mukesh Mishra

             and Abhishek Mishra are almost on similar footing and so far as

             the rest petitioners are concerned, there is no specific allegation of

             any overt-act and their case stands on better footing to the case of

             co-accused, Rupesh Mishra.

             persons died and several persons sustained firearm injuries in the

             alleged occurrence and the manner in which the petitioners and

             other accused committed the alleged crime clearly demonstrates

                   this fact that all the accused persons including the petitioners

                   committed the alleged crime in a pre-planned manner and,

                   therefore, petitioners do not deserve the privilege of bail.

                   fact that one co-accused, namely, Rupesh Mishra, having more or

                   less similar allegation, has already been granted privilege of bail

                   by the learned court below, let all the above named petitioners be
