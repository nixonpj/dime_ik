                                             ... Respondents

(By Smt Archana P. Tiwari, AGA for R1 to R3)

       This Writ Petition is filed under Articles 226 &amp; 227 of
the Constitution of India, praying to issue a writ of
mandamus directing the respondents to consider the
representation dated 20.01.2017 as per Annexure 'E' for
issue of notifications and payment of compensation
amount of Land Sy.No.468 measuring 03 acres 21 guntas
of village Tumkur, Tq. Shahapur, Dist: Yadgir, owned by
the petitioner.

      This petition is coming on for orders this day, the
Court made the following:-

                          ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner herein is said to be the owner of the

land bearing Sy.No.468 of Tumkuru Village, Shahapur

Taluk, Yadgiri District. According to him an extent of

03 acres 21 guntas of land in the aforesaid survey number

belonging to him is acquired for construction of Googal

Bridge-Barrage.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span><p id="p_2">


</p><p id="p_3">       2.    According to petitioner though the land is

utilized for the project, the respondents have not taken

steps to initiate proceedings for acquisition of the land and

to consider his request for grant of compensation. Hence,

this petition is filed seeking direction to respondents. In

support of that they rely upon a typed copy said to have

been issued by the Government of Karnataka in Form No.2

indicating the list of land which needs to be acquired on

the ground that the said lands are sub-merged while

constructing Googal Bridge-cum-Barrage. The form is said

to be dated 30.11.2011. There is no reference to the

author of the document and which authority has issued,

with reference to which proceedings are not seen and the

corresponding original of this        is also not      produced.

However, when another xerox copy which is claimed as

xerox of the original is looked into, the same would bear

the date as 30.11.2011 which is subsequently inserted in

to the said document and same is produced as typed copy

of   original.   Therefore,   the   genuineness   of   aforesaid

documents cannot be believed.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span><p id="p_4">


</p><p id="p_5">      3.     While Annexure-C is seen, the petitioner by

issuing legal notice dated 09.01.2017 has called upon the

Special    Land   Acquisition   Officer,   Bheemrayana   Gudi,

Shahapur, Yadgir District to consider his case by settling

the amount due to him for acquisition of aforesaid land. In

the said legal notice also there is no reference to the date

when the said land was acquired, the notification numbers

and other required particulars to consider their prayer. The

third respondent Special Land Acquisition Officer in his

reply dated 19.01.2017, has called upon the petitioner to

furnish the particulars with reference to the acquisition of

his land. To the said reply there is no response from the

petitioner till date. Thereafter, this writ petition is filed,

wherein, he has relied upon another document which is

referred to as Annexure-A which is representation dated

02.02.2011. In that also there is no reference to the date

as to when the land of petitioner herein was acquired.

When the entire material available on record in the writ

petition is looked into, it is nothing but a chance litigation.

His attempt to assert that his land is already sub-merged
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     5</span>


while constructing the Googal Bridge-cum-barrage which is

not supported by any document.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">       4.       Further this Court after observing all these

passed an order on 27.02.2018 calling upon the petitioner

to furnish the particulars with reference to acquisition of

land       as   stated   by   him       in   his    legal   notice   and

representation. For that also there is no response from the

petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">       5.       In that view of the matter this Court feel that

this is nothing but a frivolous petition initiated by the

petitioner       with    ulterior   motive         as   stated   supra.

Accordingly, this writ        petition is dismissed by imposing

costs of Rs.2,000/- payable to the Registry. If cost of

R.2,000/- is not paid within 30 days from the date of

receipt of a copy of this order, the Registry shall initiate

proceedings for his arrest and remand to civil prison until

cost is recovered.
