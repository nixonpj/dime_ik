      The    revision    petitioner      is    the    4th accused  in

C.C.No.646/1999 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of the

First Class-II, Aluva. The 1st respondent herein prosecuted the

revision petitioner along with three others alleging offence

under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_1">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The 1st

accused was a partnership firm of which accused Nos.2 to 4

were the partners.        The prosecution is based upon Ext.P1

cheque executed by 3rd and 4th accused on behalf of the firm.

The revision petitioner took up a plea that he had not signed

Ext.P1. During the trial, on the side of the 1st respondent PW1

was examined and Exts.P1 to P12 were marked. On the defence

side, one witness was examined as DW1 and Ext.D1 was

marked. The case against the 1st accused was split up. After the

trial, the revision petitioner was found guilty. Consequently, the

revision petitioner was convicted and sentenced to simple

imprisonment      for    six    months.      Though      he preferred

Crl.A.No.130/2003 before the Additional Sessions Judge, North

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Crl.R.P.No.2240/2004            2</span>


Paravur, he was not successful.          Assailing the legality,

correctness and propriety of the above conviction and sentence

as confirmed in appeal, this Revision Petition was filed.



</p><p id="p_2">      2.     I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner

and Smt.K.N.Rajani appearing for the 1st respondent and

perused the records. Going by the evidence on record, I find

that the 1st respondent through the evidence of PW1 supported

by Exts.P1 to P12 had succeeded to establish that on behalf of

the partnership firm, the revision petitioner along with one of

the partners executed Ext.P1 cheque in discharge of a liability

amounting to Rs.56,557.82/- and that when Ext.P1 was

presented for collection it was returned dishonoured for

insufficient funds as evidenced by Exts.P2 and P3 memos. A

notice demanding discharge of liability was caused to the

revision petitioner. It was returned unclaimed. There was no

discharge of the liability. The defence plea that Ext.P1 was not

signed by the revision petitioner was correctly disbelieved by the

courts below. I find no reason to interfere with the finding of

facts by the courts below.      There is no error, illegality or

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Crl.R.P.No.2240/2004             3</span>


impropriety to be rectified in exercise of the revisional powers.

The conviction under challenge is based upon cogent evidence

and requires no interference.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">      3.     Having due regard to the fact that the liability arose

out of a business transaction in the name of a firm and that the

revision petitioner being only one of the partner, I find that he is

entitled to a little leniency in sentence and that the

1st respondent is to be duly compensated.           Therefore, the

sentence impugned requires interference. Having due regard to

the facts and circumstance of the case, I find that sentence of

imprisonment till the rising of the court with a fine of Rs.60,000/-

(Rupees sixty thousand) would meet the ends of justice.



</p><p id="p_5">      4.     In the result, the Revision Petition is disposed of as

follows:
</p>
<p id="p_6">      The conviction under challenge is confirmed. The sentence

is reduced to imprisonment till the rising of the court and a fine

of Rs.60,000/- (Rupees sixty thousand only).         In default of

payment of fine, the revision petitioner shall undergo simple

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">Crl.R.P.No.2240/2004           4</span>


imprisonment for six months.      Out of the fine amount, if

collected, Rs.56,000/- (Rupees Fifty six thousand only) shall be

paid to the 1st respondent as compensation.       The revision

petitioner is granted three months time to remit the fine. Till

then, the bail bond executed by the revision petitioner shall

remain in force.
