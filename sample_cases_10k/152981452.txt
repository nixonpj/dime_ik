                         ALEXANDER THOMAS, J.
                  -------------------------------------------
                            B.A.No. 7444 of 2019
                ----------------------------------------------
                Dated this the 30th day of October, 2019

                                  ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">           Five petitioners herein have been arrayed as accused Nos.1

    to 4 and 6 among the six accused in the instant Crime

    No.366/2019 of Meenangadi Police Station, which has been

    registered for offences punishable under Sections 143, 144, 147,

    148, 323, 324, 308 and Sec.149 of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a> on the basis of the

    information statement given by the defacto complainant on

    26.9.2019 at about 6.30 p.m. in respect of the alleged incident

    which happened on the previous day (25.9.2019)at about 8.30

    p.m. in the night.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           2.      The prosecution case in short is that on account of

    prior animosity, the accused persons on 25.9.2019 at about 8.30

    p.m. had formed themselves into an unlawful assembly and had

    assaulted the de facto complainant with deadly weapons and that

    A3 had hit on the forehead of the defacto complainant using an

    iron rod and whereby he has sustained lacerated wound on his

    forehead. That on seeing this, another person had come there to

    intervene to stop the assault and then the said person was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> B.A.No.7444/2019                       3</span>

    assaulted by the other accused persons. The prosecution would

    say that medical reports would show that the other injured

    person has now sustained blood clot on his spinal code on

    account of the above said assault and that he may require surgery

    in future to deal with the said medical condition. Further it is

    seen that accused No.5 had already been arrested and remanded

    in this case.
</p>
<p id="p_3">           3.      The learned counsel for the petitioners would point

    out that the above said allegations are false and baseless and

    further that the truth is other way round and that Annexure-A2

    counter case has been registered as Crime No.367/2019 of

    Meenangadi Police Station for offences punishable under

    <a href="/doc/1096965/" id="a_2">Sections 143</a>, <a href="/doc/1258372/" id="a_3">147</a>, <a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_4">447</a>, <a href="/doc/222396/" id="a_5">427</a>, <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_6">324</a> and <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_7">149</a> of the IPC on 26.9.2019

    at about 7.15 p.m. in respect of the alleged incident which

    happened on the previous day on 25.9.2019 at about 9 p.m. in

    which the wife of the accused No.2 herein is the defacto

    complainant therein and the defacto complainant herein and 20

    others have been arrayed as the accused therein. Further that the

    custodial interrogation of the petitioners is not necessary in this

    case and that this Court may order to grant them anticipatory

    bail etc.

</p><p id="p_4">           4.      The learned Public Prosecutor has pointed out that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> B.A.No.7444/2019                       4</span>

    the police is investigating both the present case as well as

    Annexure-A2 crime and that merely because of registration of

    Annexure-A2 crime does not in any manner necessarily exclude

    the present crime. The learned Public Prosecutor would submit

    that since the accused No.5 has already been arrested and

    remanded, there is no logic or reason for giving a treatment to

    the present petitioners, who are the other accused persons

    therein.
</p>
<p id="p_5">           5.      The learned counsel for the petitioner then would

    submit on the basis of instructions of his party that the

    petitioners will immediately surrender before the Investigating

    Officer concerned, so that their bail application could be

    considered and decided by the learned Magistrate on the same

    day of their production, after hearing both sides.

</p><p id="p_6">           6.      Taking note of the above said submission made on

    behalf of the petitioners, the following orders and directions are

    passed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                    1) The petitioners will immediately personally
           appear before the Investigating Officer in relation to the
           instant crime No366/2019 of Meenangadi Police Station
           for interrogation purposes without any further delay, at
           any rate, by 10 a.m. on any day on or before 08.11.2019 or
           within such time limit that may be extended by the
           Investigating Officer as he deems fit and proper.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> B.A.No.7444/2019                        5</span>

</p><p id="p_8">                   2)   The petitioners will fully co-operate with the
           Investigating Officer in the above interrogation process.
</p><p id="p_9">                   3)   After the interrogation process is over, the
           Investigating Officer will produce the petitioners before the
           jurisdictional magistrate Court concerned in the above
           said crime and thereupon the said Court shall consider and
           pass orders on the bail applications of the petitioners on
           the same day of their production, after affording
           opportunity of being heard to the petitioners' counsel and
           the learned Public Prosecutor and after taking into account
           the facts and circumstances of this case.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
           Accordingly, the plea for anticipatory bail fails and the

    same will stand dismissed.
</p>
