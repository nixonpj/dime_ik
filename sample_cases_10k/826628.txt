04.10.1968 as a daily rated Clerk in the Office of Taluka Panchayat
Visavadar. The petitioner was appointed as Junior Clerk on ad-hoc
basis on 30.08.1993. As the petitioner has requisite qualification of

service. However, the respondent has not regularized the petitioner.
Hence, this petition.

that the petitioner made representation to the Taluka Development
Officer, Visavadar for regularization of his service on 31.07.2008
which is not decided. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_10">4.0	As
a result of hearing and perusal of record, especially in view of the
pendency of the representation of the petitioner, interest of justice

keeping in mind the law prevailing as on 	today within a period of
six weeks from the date of the	receipt of the order of this
Court.
