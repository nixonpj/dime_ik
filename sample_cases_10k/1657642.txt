</p>
<p id="p_4">:COMMON ORDER

                Both the  above  Civil  Revision  Petitions  have  been  filed
against  the  fair  and  decretal  order  dated 30.4.2003 respectively made in
I.A.Nos.236 and 237 of 2003 in O.S.No.1370 of 2002 by the Court of Subordinate
Judge, Namakkal, thereby allowing the Interlocutory Applications filed by  the
respondents  herein  under  Order IX, Rule 13 r/w Order XVII, Rule 2 &amp; Section
151 C.P.C.  praying to set aside the decree passed by the said Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                2.  Tracing the history of the case, what comes to be known is
that  the  petitioner  herein filed the suit in O.S.No.733 of 1996 before this
Court, which was later transferred to the Court of Subordinate Judge,  Sankari
and  re-numbered  as  O.S.No.762  of  1997 and on point of jurisdiction it was
again transferred to the Court of Subordinate Judge, Namakkal and  re-numbered
as  O.S.No.1370  of  2002  praying  to  direct  the  defendants to execute and
register a sale deed in favour of the plaintiff or his nominee or nominees, of
the schedule property  after  receiving  the  balance  sale  consideration  of
Rs.1,75,000/-,  to  hand  over  vacant possession of the suit property, to pay
mesne profits from the date of filing of the suit till delivery  of  the  suit
property and alternatively direct the defendants to pay the plaintiff a sum of
Rs.11  ,00,000/-  with  interest  at  12% per annum from the date of suit till
realisation and for that purpose create a charge over the suit  properties  in
favour of the plaintiff, for a permanent injunction restraining the defendants
2  and  3  and  the  1st defendant, power of attorney agent from in any manner
creating any kind of  documents  and  restraining  them  from  in  any  manner
alienating  and  encumbering the suit property till final disposal of the suit
and for costs; that the suit was contested by the respondents herein; that the
suit was decreed in favour of the petitioner herein; that  the  respondents  2
and 3 herein have filed I.A.No.287 of 2003 and the first respondent herein has
filed  I.A.No.286  of  2003  under Order IX, Rule 13 r/w Order XVII Rule 2 and
Section 151 of C.P.C.  praying to set aside the decree on the ground that  the
defendants  were  not  examined  as  witnesses  to put forth their substantial
rights and that no opportunity was given to them to crossexamine  P.W.1;  that
though  the  suit  was posted for cross-examination of P.W.1 on 5.12.2002 they
were not able to cross-examine P.W.1, because of P.W.1 was not present on that
day; that the defendants were not also given opportunity to enter defence.
</p>
<p id="p_6">        3.  The learned  Subordinate  Judge,  after  considering  the  reasons
assigned  on  the  part of the defendants and the defence taken on the part of
the petitioner herein, also following the decision of the Apex Court cited  on
the  part  of  the defendants would ultimately allow the applications, thereby
setting aside the judgment and decree dated 5.12.2 002 made in O.S.No.1370  of
2002.   It  is  only  testifying  the  validity  of the said fair and decretal
orders, the petitioner has come forward  to  file  the  above  Civil  Revision
Petitions  on  grounds  that  the  suit  itself  was  decreed  on  merits, the
provisions under Order IX Rule 13 C.P.C.  would not be  applicable;  that  the
impugned  order  was  passed  without jurisdiction since the decree was passed
under Order XVII Rule 3 C.P.C.  and was based on a detailed judgment; that the
impugned order has been passed without noting that the decisions cited therein
have no relevance to the facts of the case and therefore, the  impugned  order
is not sustainable in law and ought to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        4.   During  arguments, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
Revision Petitioner in both the above Civil Revision Petitions besides tracing
the history of the case right from the beginning would  arrive  at  the  point
that in the suit written statement was filed on 25.3.1997; that nearly 6 years
the  matter  has  been  kept  pending for trial to be completed; that the suit
itself was dismissed for default on 29 .7.1999 and thereafter it was  restored
on 11.8.2002; that the trial commenced on 21.11.2002 and the decree was passed
in the suit on 5.12.2002 on a detailed judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        5.   At  this  juncture,  the learned counsel would cite the following
judgments:
</p><p id="p_9">(1) An unreported judgment passed by the  Supreme  Court  of  India  in  Civil
Appeal Nos.2690 and 2691 of 2003 dated 3.4.2003.
</p><p id="p_10">(2) 1987(1)  MLJ 20 (<a href="/doc/1357581/" id="a_1">B.CHAMPALAL JAIN vs.  M/S.CHEWARCHAND ASHOK KUMAR AND CO.
REP</a>.  BY CHEWARACHAND PARICK-I)
(3) 2000(2)T.L.N.J.  285 (<a href="/doc/381694/" id="a_2">ARUMUGHA GOUNDER AND OTHERS vs.  TMT</a>.    PALANIAMMAL
AND OTHERS)

</p><p id="p_11">                6.  In the first judgment cited on the part of the petitioner,
since  the  defendants  1 to 3 were called absent, the trial Court had decreed
the suit as prayed for and thereafter the defendants had filed an  Application
under  Order 9 Rule 13 of the CPC before the trial Court to set aside the said
judgment and decree and on the said petition having been allowed by the  trial
Court,  a  revision  had been filed before the High Court by the plaintiff and
the same also having been dismissed, he had filed the Civil Appeal before  the
Honourable Apex  Court.   The Honourable Apex Court giving expression to Order
XVII Rules 2 and 3 of C.P.C.  and extracting the said Rules, would remark that
the case was having imprints of an ex-parte adjudication and not of a decision
on merits and there was not even  any  indication  as  to  what  evidence  was
evaluated  and/or whether the merits were tested and had ultimately decided in
the following terms:
</p><p id="p_12">we find no infirmity in the impugned judgment to warrant interference.    The
appeals are dismissed but with no order as to costs.
</p><p id="p_13">                7.    In  the  second  judgment  cited  on  the  part  of  the
petitioner, a learned single Judge of this Court has held:
The Court below when it closed the evidence and  proceeded  with  the  matter
subsequently, it  did proceed with the case under Or.17, R.3(a) C.P.C.  But by
virtue of the Explanations attached to Rule 2 of Or.17, C.P.C., if substantial
portion of the evidence of any party had already been recorded and such  party
fails  to appear on any day to which the hearing of the suit is adjourned, the
Court may in its discretion, proceed with the  case  as  if  such  party  were
present.
</p><p id="p_14">        8.   In  the third judgment cited on the part of the petitioner, after
the closure of both sides' evidence and at the time of arguments, the  learned
counsel for  the  defendants reported no instructions.  In such circumstances,
the learned trial Judge had proceeded to  decide  the  matter  on  merits  and
decreed  the  suit  as prayed for, which was taken on appeal by the defendants
and a learned single Judge of this Court while discussing the  powers  of  the
Court  under  such  circumstances  and  giving  expression to Order 17, Rule 2
C.P.C.  had dismissed the appeal suit filed by the  defendants.    Citing  the
above judgments, the learned counsel for the revision petitioner would pray to
allow the civil revision petitions.
</p><p id="p_15">        9.   On the part of the respondents also the following judgments would
be cited by their counsel:
</p>
<p id="p_16">(1) (2003)2 M.L.J.  186 (S.C) (<a href="/doc/729429/" id="a_3">B.JANAKIRAMAIAH CHETTY vs.  A.K.  PARTHASARATHI
AND OTHERS</a>)
(2) AIR 1987 SUPREME COURT 42  (<a href="/doc/89872/" id="a_4">PRAKASH  CHANDER  MANCHANDA  AND  ANOTHER  vs.
SMT.JANKI MANCHANDA</a>)
(3) 1988-1- L.W.368 (<a href="/doc/960896/" id="a_5">M.A.SUYAMBULINGAM vs.  V.K.SWAMINATHAN AND ANOTHER</a>)
(4) 1992-2-L.W.  536 (<a href="/doc/1732611/" id="a_6">KAMAKSHI vs.  JUGRAJ JAIN</a>)

</p><p id="p_17">        10.  In the first judgment cited above on the part of the respondents,
the Honourable Apex Court has held:
</p><p id="p_18">In  the  absence  any indication as regards merits of the case, preferring an
appeal will be really inconsequential.  It is more so when no definite  ground
of  appeal  can be pressed into service, except making generalized challenges.
It certainly cannot be the legislative intent.

</p><p id="p_19">        11.   In  the  second  judgment  cited  above  on  the  part  of   the
respondents, the Honourable Apex Court has held:
</p><p id="p_20">If  on a date fixed,one of the parties to the suit remain absent and for that
party no evidence has been examined up to that date, the Court has  no  option
but to proceed to dispose of the matter in accordance with O.17,R.2 in any one
of the  modes  prescribed  under O.9 of the Civil P.C.  After the Amendment by
Act 104 of 1976 to O.17 Rr.2 and 3 in cases  where  a  party  is  absent  only
course is  as  mentioned  in O.17, R.3(b) to proceed under R.2.  Therefore, in
absence of the defendant, the Court had  no  option  but  proceed  under  R.2.
Similarly the language of R.2 as now stands also clearly lays down that if any
one of the parties fails to appear, the Court has to proceed to dispose of the
suit in  one  of the modes directed under O.9.  The explanation to R.2 gives a
discretion to the Court to proceed under R.3 even if a  party  is  absent  but
that  discretion  is  limited onl y in cases where a party which is absent has
led some evidence or has examined substantial part of their evidence.

</p><p id="p_21">        12.  In the third judgment cited above on the part of the respondents,
the Honourable Apex Court has held:
</p><p id="p_22">According to the explanation, to O.17, R.2, C.P.C.    the  party  failing  to
appear should have let in evidence or a substantial portion of the evidence in
order  to  enable  the  Court  to  proceed  with the case as if the party were
present.  In this case the first defendant has not let in any evidence in this
case.  Only the plaintiff had let in evidence and the  second  defendant  also
has let  in  evidence.   The contesting first defendant had not entered on his
defence, so to say, by giving  any  evidence  and  his  counsel  withdrew  his
appearance during the examination to P.W.1.  In such circumstances, in view of
the  Explanation to R.2 of O.17, it could not be said that the first defendant
should be treated as having begun his part of the case in the suit,  entitling
the court   to  proceed  with  the  case  as  if  he  was  present.    In  the
circumstances, the treatment of the case as ex parte was right  and  does  not
call for any interference."
</p>
<p id="p_23">        13.   In the last judgment cited above on the part of the respondents,
even though the defendant was present in the Court, she did not participate in
the hearing and her counsel was also absent and hence an ex parte  decree  was
passed against  her.   The application filed by the defendant to set aside the
ex parte decree was dismissed on ground that only an appeal would lie  against
such  a  judgment  and  that the application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC was not
maintainable.  Aggrieved, the  defendant  preferred  the  Civil  Miscellaneous
Appeal wherein a learned single Judge of this Court has held:
</p>
<p id="p_24">"In  the  instant  case,  the  defendant  was present, but her counsel was not
present at the time when the case was adjourned.  The defendant,  even  though
was  physically  present,  was  incapable of participating in the proceedings,
being a widow and not knowing the procedure  of  court.    The  defendant  was
helpless  in such a situation, as she could not proceed without the assistance
of her advocate.  In the circumstances, the order passed by  the  lower  Court
cannot be  construed  as  an  order  under  Order 17 Rule 3 CPC.  It has to be
construed as an order under Order 17, Rule 2 CPC  and  the  application  filed
under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC is maintainable."
</p><p id="p_25">Citing  the  above  judgments,  the  learned counsel for the respondents would
submit that the Court below has considered all the facts and circumstances  of
the case in the manner expected by law and hence no interference of this Court
is required and would pray to dismiss the above civil revision petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_26">        14.  In consideration of the  facts  pleaded,  having  regard  to  the
materials placed on record and upon hearing the learned counsel for both, what
comes  to be known is that it is a suit which was originally filed in the year
1996 before this Court and thereafter it had been transferred to the Court  of
original  jurisdiction,  the  Court  of  Subordinate  Judge,  Sankari  with  a
direction to dispose of the matter  within  three  months  and  thereafter  on
creation  of  a  new  District  Namakkal,  administratively, the case has been
transferred to the present Court wherein the suit is  pending  i.e.    in  the
Court  of Subordinate Judge, Namakkal and got re-numbered as O.S.1307 of 2002.
Therefore, it has to be remembered that it is a case which is kept pending for
seven years.
</p>
<p id="p_27">        15.   In the meantime, the trial Courts have carried on their exercise
of trying the said suit and ultimately even the suit had been finally disposed
of decreeing the same with costs in favour of the  petitioner  herein  and  at
this  juncture,  the  respondents 2 and 3 herein have filed I.A.No.237 of 2003
and yet another I.A.No.236 of 2003 has been  filed  by  the  first  respondent
under  Order  9 Rule 13 r/w.Order 17 Rule 2 and Section 151 CPC praying to set
aside the decree on ground that the defendants were not examined as  witnesses
to  put-forth  their  substantial  rights and that no opportunity was given to
them to crossexamine P.W.1.  These two Interlocutory Applications having  come
to  be  allowed  by the trial Court itself, the petitioner has come forward to
file the above civil revision petitions on certain grounds  as  brought  forth
and traced supra.
</p>
<p id="p_28">        16.  During arguments, three decisions would be ushered in on the part
of the petitioner and on the part of the respondents, four decisions have been
cited  justifying  the  order  passed  by  the  trial  Court in allowing those

<p id="p_29">        17.  It may be pointed out that the decisions cited on the part of the
petitioner have been rendered  by  the  respective  Courts  mentioned  therein
adhering  to  the facts and circumstances encircling those cases dealt with by
them and they have little application to the facts of the case in  hand.    On
the contrary, the decisions cited on the part of the respondents herein reveal
that  `in  the  absence  of  any  indication  as  regards  merits of the case,
preferring an appeal will be really inconsequential; that it is more  so  when
no  definite  ground  of  appeal  can  be  pressed  into service except making
generalized challenges, which certainly cannot be the legislative  intent'  as
it  has  been  held  by  the Honourable Apex Court in the judgment reported in
(2003) II M.L.J.  186 (SC), further giving expression to Order 17 Rules 2  and
3  and  Order  9  of the CPC, so far as the other judgments on the part of the
respondents are concerned and therefore, no d oubt, adopting three of the four
judgments cited by the respondents herein and in full consideration  of  those
propositions  held  by  the  upper  forums, the lower Court has arrived at the
valid conclusion to allow the two  Interlocutory  Applications  filed  by  the
respondents herein.

<p id="p_30">        18.   Further  more,  in  its  recent  judgment  delivered  in <a href="/doc/1591400/" id="a_7">SUKANYA
HOLDINGS (P) LTD.  vs.  JAYESH H.PANDYA AND ANOTHER</a> reported in (2003)  5  SCC
531, the Honourable Apex Court has held:
</p>
<p id="p_31">"For  interpretation  of  Section 8 (of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_8">Conciliation Act</a>),
<a href="/doc/310829/" id="a_9">Section 5</a> would have no  bearing.    Except  <a href="/doc/1146817/" id="a_10">Section  8</a>,  there  is  no  other
provision  in  the  Act  that in a pending suit, the dispute is required to be
referred to the arbitrator.   Further,  the  matter  is  not  required  to  be
referred  to  the  Arbitral  Tribunal,  if  (1) the parties to the arbitration
agreement have not filed any such application for referring the dispute to the
arbitrator; (2) in a pending  suit,  such  application  is  not  filed  before
submitting  first  statement  on  the  substance  of  the dispute; or (3) such
application is not accompanied by the original arbitration agreement  or  duly
certified copy  thereof.  This would, therefore, mean that the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_11">Arbitration Act</a>
does not oust the jurisdiction of the civil court to decide the dispute  in  a
case  where parties to the arbitration agreement do not take appropriate steps
as contemplated under sub-sections (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/1232861/" id="a_12">Section 8</a> of the Act."
</p>
<p id="p_32">        19.  When such is the legal position as clarified  by  the  Honourable
Apex Court in matters of such nature, this Court does not see any valid reason
to cause its interference into the well considered and merited order passed by
the Court below and hence the following order:
</p><p id="p_33">In result,
</p><p id="p_34">(i)the  above civil revision petitions do not merit acceptance and they become
liable only to be dismissed and are dismissed accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_35">(ii)The common fair and decretal order dated 30.4.2003 made in I.A.    Nos.236
and  237  of  2003  in  O.S.No.1370 of 2002 by the Court of Subordinate Judge,
Namakkal is hereby confirmed.
</p><p id="p_36">        However, in the circumstances of the cases, there shall be no order as
to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_37">        Consequently, C.M.P.Nos.10515 and 10516 of 2003 are also dismissed.
