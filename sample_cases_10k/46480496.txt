IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH


                                           ITA No. 270 of 2009

Commissioner of Income Tax

CORAM:-     HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ADARSH KUMAR GOEL.
            HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AJAY KUMAR MITTAL.


PRESENT: Ms. Urvashi Dhugga, Senior Standing Counsel,
         for the appellant.


ADARSH KUMAR GOEL, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.          This order will dispose of ITA Nos. 125 of 2008 and 270 of

2009 as the question involved in both the appeals is common.

</p><p id="p_2">2.          ITA No. 270 of 2009 has been filed by the revenue under

<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1">Section 260A</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short "the Act") against

order dated 5.7.2007 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal,

Chandigarh Bench "B" (hereinafter referred to as "the Tribunal") in ITA

No. 244/CHD/2007 for the assessment year 2004-05, claiming following

substantial question of law:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                   "Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of

                   the case and in law, the order of the ITAT is perverse

                   as the ITAT has failed to appreciate the fact that the

                   "Optional Early Retirement Scheme" floated by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> ITA No. 270 of 2009                                            -2-</span>

                  employer was not eligible for exemption u/s 10(10C)

                  of the I.T. Act, 1961?"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">3.          The respondent-assessee was an employee of Reserve

Bank of India and opted for Voluntary Retirement Scheme during the

year relevant to the assessment year 2004-05.         The scheme was

circulated by the Reserve Bank of India vide Circular No. 1 dated

11.8.2003. The assessee claimed exemption under <a href="/doc/1565599/" id="a_2">Section 10(10C)</a> of

the Act in respect of the amount received to the extent of Rs.5 lacs.

Subsequently, the assessee also claimed relief under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_3">Section 89(1)</a> of

the Act on the balance portion. He claimed that Rule 2BA of the Income

Tax Rules (in short "the Rules") was applicable. The Assessing Officer

allowed relief under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_4">Section 89(1)</a> of the Act but did not allow exemption

under <a href="/doc/1565599/" id="a_5">Section 10(10C)</a>. On appeal, the CIT (A) upheld the order of the

Assessing Officer but on further appeal the plea of the assessee for

exemption under <a href="/doc/1565599/" id="a_6">Section 10(10C)</a> was accepted by the Tribunal relying

upon the order of Mumbai Bench of ITAT in Vaishali A. Sehlar etc. v.

ACIT etc. (ITA No. 6384/M/06 to 5581/M/2006 dated 28th March, 2007).

</p><p id="p_4">4.          We have heard learned counsel for the appellant.

</p><p id="p_5">5.          Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the scheme

was not in accordance with the requirements of Rule 2BA of the Rules

and, therefore, exemption under <a href="/doc/1565599/" id="a_7">Section 10(10C)</a> was not applicable.

</p><p id="p_6">6.          We are unable to accept the submission.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.          The matter with reference to the same scheme was

examined by the Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/1670354/" id="a_8">Commissioner of Income-Tax

v. NageshDevidas Kulkarni</a> [2007] 291 ITR 407 (Bom) and decided

against the revenue.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> ITA No. 270 of 2009                                           -3-</span><p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">8.          In the present case, relief under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_9">Section 89(1)</a> has been

allowed by the Assessing Officer. Only question is about applicability of

<a href="/doc/1565599/" id="a_10">Section 10(10C)</a> of the Act.     A perusal of <a href="/doc/1565599/" id="a_11">Section 10(10C)</a>        clearly

shows that the amount received by the employees of Public Sector

Company or statutory authority is covered by exemption upto Rs.5 lacs.

The very same scheme having been held to be covered by <a href="/doc/1954990/" id="a_12">Section 10</a>

(10C) of the Act by the Bombay High Court in Nagesh Devidas

Kulkarni's case (supra) and no contrary view having been shown, we

do not find any reason to take a different view.        Accordingly, the

question has to be answered against the revenue and in favour of the

assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.          Both the appeals are dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.         A photo copy of this order be placed on the file of the

connected case.</p><pre id="pre_2">
