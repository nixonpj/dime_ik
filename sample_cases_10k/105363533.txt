<p id="p_22">(x)             PW-10 SI Bijender Singh deposed that on 24.08.2016, he
received the file of the present case in MACT cell for further investigation.
He inspected the case file and obtained the result of MLCs. As the MLC of
Satpal Singh showed grievous injury, therefore, he added <a href="/doc/1721129/" id="a_8">section 338</a> IPC in
the charge-sheet. The offending vehicle i.e. bus was released on superdari.
Thereafter, he prepared the challan and filed the same in the court.

<p id="p_23">(xi)            PW-11 Gurvider Singh deposed that he was working at the
Airport in a Company called Buddy Retail Private Limited as a Manager from

 to Sector 21 Dwarka Metro Station. When they reached near Welcome
Hotel at 19/20 Sector Red Light, one bus came from the left hand side and
hit their car on the left hand side. They received injuries. Pintu got him and
Jivika out of the car. The bus driver came out of the bus. The bus driver saw
them and remained at the spot for sometime and thereafter he left.
Somebody called the police. PW-11 and Jivika were bleeding heavily and
therefore somebody took them to ARTEIMS Hospital. After reaching
ARTEIMS Hospital, Raman Singh was declared brought dead. Witness was
medically treated. He proved photographs of the bus as Ex.P2 (colly).
</p><p id="p_24">                In his cross-examination, he stated that the accident occurred
at about 12 midnight. He denied that accident occurred between 12:30 and
1 am. Safari Car was being driven by Satpal. There was Red Light which at
time of accident was blinking yellow light. He denied that Satpal was driving
vehicle at high speed. He denied that the Safari Car hit the offending vehicle
i.e. bus. He could not say when Ex.P-2 (colly) were taken. He denied that

<p id="p_25">(xii)           PW-12 Ms. Jevika Sarwari deposed that she was a Model and
Actress. She had come to Delhi for a Project. On 24.09.2016 (she did not
remember the exact date). On the date of the accident, she was going to
Airport from Dwarka Sector 13 and she was in a four wheeler. She believe
that the car belonged to one Gurvinder, who was her friend. Somewhere


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">FIR No.241/16                   State vs. Samer (Judgment)         Page 11 of 17</span>
 between 8:30 p.m. to 09:30 p.m. their car met with an accident with a bus
and she only remembered that PW-12, her friend Gurivinder and 2-3 other
people who were sitting in the car with them were taken to the hospital by
the police. She did not know how the accident took place. She did not see
the driver of the offending vehicle. She stated that she could not identify the
driver if shown to her. She did not remember the registration number of any
vehicle.
</p><p id="p_26">                In her cross-examination, she stated that she did not see the
accident, hence, she could not say how it happened. She denied that the
car in which they were travelling was in a very high speed. However, it was
going at the speed of 80-100 km/hour. There were two-three passengers in
the car. She only knew Gurvinder in the passengers, she did not know the
driver and other people in the car. She did not remember if there was a red
light or not. She did not know if their car banged into the bus or bus banged
into the car.
</p>

<p id="p_27">6.              Thereafter, prosecution evidence was closed.
</p>

<p id="p_28">7.              Statement of accused was recorded and all the incriminating
evidence coming on record was put to the accused in which he submitted
that he had been falsely implicated in the present case. He did not lead
evidence in defence. Thereafter, final arguments were addressed.
</p>

<p id="p_29">8.              It has been argued by Ld. APP for the State that there was
rashness and negligence on the part of the accused who was driving the
bus in such a high speed and that too on the cross roads which is shown by


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">FIR No.241/16                   State vs. Samer (Judgment)          Page 12 of 17</span>
 the site plan which has been proved by the public witnesses as well as the
police witnesses. The positions of the vehicles at the time of accident and
after the accident clearly shows the speed and rashness of the offending
vehicle. He has prayed for conviction of the accused as not only injury has
been caused to three people but there has been a death of one passenger
due the act of the accused.
</p>

<p id="p_30">9.              On the other hand, the main arguments of counsel for accused
was that the negligence was primarily of the driver of TATA Safari who was
driving his vehicle at a very high speed of almost 80-100 km/hr (as stated by
PW-12). The accused Samer was driving the bus most carefully and it was
the TATA Safari which banged into the bus head on causing death of one
person and injuries to other passengers. He also submitted that due to the
impact of the accident the TATA safari virtually swayed in the opposite
direction and even was skid to a distance of few meters which could have
only happened if it was in a very high speed. He has attributed contributory
negligence to the driver of Tata Safari and has prayed for acquittal on the
same ground.
</p><p id="p_31">10.             After hearing the arguments and going through the record, I
have come to the following observations:
</p><p id="p_32">                The accused has been charged u/s 279/337/338/304A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">IPC</a>.
                The two things that need to be proved for 337/338/304A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a>
are (a) simple hurt/grievous hurt/death was caused to the victim (b) it was
caused due to rash and negligent act of the accused.
</p><p id="p_33">(I)               In the present case, both the facts have been duly proved.
The injuries upon the victims as well as the death of one Ramanjeet has


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">FIR No.241/16                  State vs. Samer (Judgment)         Page 13 of 17</span>
 been duly proved.
</p><p id="p_34">(II)            As far as the fact of rashness and negligence is concerned,
the first look at the site plan shows the impact with which the bus hit the Tata
Safari. Due to the impact of the bus it was dragged to several meters away
from the spot of the accident. After hitting the TATA Safari the bus banged
into a tree uprooting it and even broke the cemented pipe near the
pavement. The photographs placed on record and exhibited by the
witnesses not only show the state of the Tata Safari after the accident which
is totally smashed from the bonnet but also the uprooted tree and the
broken cemented pipe near the tree. So much damage could not had been
caused had a bus been in a reasonably slow speed. Negligence has been
defined as absence of due care and caution which is expected of a prudent
person. In the present situation the bus was about to cross the choraha
(cross roads) and prudence and caution demands that driver should have
been in a reasonably slow speed as at that point of time the red light had
changed into yellow blinker indicating that the vehicle should have maintain
a slow speed.
</p><p id="p_35">                As far as the identity of the accused is concerned, the same
has been duly established by the complainant and other witnesses, who
have duly identified the accused in the Court. The identity of the vehicle has
also been duly proved.
</p><p id="p_36">                Seeing that the facts speak for themselves and keeping in
view the present facts, nothing further remains to be proved.
</p>

<p id="p_37">11.             <a href="/doc/406841/" id="a_11">In Vadivelu Thevar v. The State of Madras</a> (1957 SCR 981)
the Hon'ble Supreme Court is Court had divided the nature of witnesses in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">FIR No.241/16                 State vs. Samer (Judgment)             Page 14 of 17</span>
 three categories, namely, wholly reliable, wholly unreliable and lastly, neither
wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable. The first two categories they pose little
difficulty but in the case of the third category of witnesses, corroboration
would be required. It is a sound and well-established rule of law that the
court is concerned with the quality and not with the quantity of the evidence
necessary for proving or disproving a fact. Generally speaking, oral
testimony in this context may be classified into three categories, namely:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        i) Wholly reliable.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">        ii) Wholly unreliable.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">        iii) Neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_38">12.             In the first category of proof, the court should have no difficulty
in coming to its conclusion either way - it may convict or may acquit on the
testimony of a single witness, if it is found to be above reproach or suspicion
of interestedness, incompetence or subornation. In the second category, the
court equally has no difficulty in coming to its conclusion. It is in the third
category of cases, that the court has to be circumspect and has to look for
corroboration in material particulars by reliable testimony, direct or
circumstantial. There is another danger in insisting on plurality of witnesses.
Irrespective of the quality of the oral evidence of a single witness, if courts
were to insist on plurality of witnesses in proof of any fact, they will be
indirectly encouraging subornation of witnesses.
</p>

<p id="p_39">13.             Vadivelu Thevar case (supra) was referred to with approval in
<a href="/doc/1673242/" id="a_12">Jagdish Prasad v. State of M.P</a>. (AIR 1994 SC 1251). The Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that as a general rule the court can and may act on the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">FIR No.241/16                    State vs. Samer (Judgment)             Page 15 of 17</span>
 testimony of a single witness provided he is wholly reliable. There is no legal
impediment in convicting a person on the sole testimony of a single witness.
That is the logic of <a href="/doc/838383/" id="a_13">Section 134</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (in short
'the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_14">Evidence Act</a>'). But, if there are doubts about the testimony the courts
will insist on corroboration. It is for the court to act upon the testimony of
witnesses. It is not the number, the quantity, but the quality that is material.
The time-honoured principle is that evidence has to be weighed and not
counted. On this principle stands the edifice of <a href="/doc/838383/" id="a_15">Section 134</a> of the Evidence
Act. The test is whether the evidence has a ring of truth, is cogent, credible
and trustworthy, or otherwise."
</p>

<p id="p_40">14.             The terminology of criminal negligence has been discussed by
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1881874/" id="a_16">S.N. Hussain v. State of Andhra
Pradesh</a>, AIR 1972 SC 685 as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                "Criminal negligence on the other hand, is the gross and
        culpable neglect or failure to exercise that reasonable and
        proper care and precaution to guard against injury either to the
        public generally or to an individual in particular, which, having
        regard to all the circumstance out of which the charge has
        arisen it was the imperative duty of the accused person to have
        adopted".
</blockquote>

<p id="p_41">15.             It has been further observed in S.N. Hussain (Supra) as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                 "Culpable negligence lies in the failure to exercise reasonable
        and proper care and the extent of its reasonableness will always
        depend upon the circumstances of each case".

<p id="p_42"> 16.             Hence, in view of above discussion, I draw the inference that
when the factum of rashness and negligence has been duly proved and the
injuries and death are also not in dispute and further the identity of the
accused is also established convincingly, the prosecution has been able to
prove its case beyond reasonable doubt u/s 279/337/338/304A <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_17">IPC</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_43">17.             Accordingly,   accused           Samer      stands   convicted      u/s
