   01                      APPELLATE SIDE

                          W. P. 2941 (W) of 2019

                            Sk. Siraj Uddin
                                 Vs.

                  Mr. Golam Mastafa,
                  Mr. Masum Ali Sardar
                                               ...for the petitioner.

                 Mr. Suddhadev Adak
                                                   ....for the State.



                 Let the report in the form of an affidavit filed in Court today on

             behalf of the District Magistrate, Howrah, in terms of our order dated

             15th February, 2019, be taken on record.

                 Perusing the same, it appears that paragraph 5 of the said

             report is relevant and the same is reproduced hereinbelow:-

                       "That the B.L. &amp; L.R.O., Domjur, Respondent no.8, has</pre>
<p id="p_1">                 enquired the matter causing physical verification of the subject
                 land and submitted a report in this regard accordingly. It
                 appears from the said report that the total water body is 16
                 decimals out of which an area of 300 (Three hundred) square
                 feet in the north-east corner of the suit plot have been filled with
                 rubbish, further area of 200 (Two hundred) square feet have also
                 been filled with plastic and the remaining portion is covered with
                 grass and weeds wherein, water is also visible there, but its
                 depth could not be ascertained. It has been alleged by the
                 petitioner that on the northern side of the suit plot, a muddy
                 road is filled up with chips, though the same has been denied by
                 the local people as reported by the concerned B. L. &amp; L.R.O.
                 Different opinions/views were gathered during the field enquiry
                 wherefrom it transpires that the Petitioner and some other
                 persons accused Respondent no.10 to 12 herein, for the recent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>


     filling of the water body in the one hand whereas, on the other
     hand it is the field enquiry wherefrom it transpires that the
     Petitioner and some other persons accused Respondent no.10 to
     12 herein, for the recent filing of the water body in the one hand
     whereas, on the other hand it is stated by others that the filing
     of the water body took place gradually due to the throwing of
     garbage therein, since long by the local people."
</p>

<p id="p_2">       Considering the statements made in paragraph 5 of the report

as quoted above, we direct the District Magistrate, Howrah, to take

immediate steps by issuing necessary directions upon the concerned

authority/authorities to forthwith take steps in order to stop

throwing of garbage into the said water body and its bank and

further, also issue necessary direction for removing the garbage from

the said water body and having it thoroughly cleaned so as to

maintain ecological balance.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       The writ petition stands disposed of accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for, be

given to the parties.
</p>
