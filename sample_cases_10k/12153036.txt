     THIS CRIMINAL PETITION FILED UNDER 482 CR.P.C
BY THE ADVOCATE FOR THE PETITIONER PRAYING THAT
THIS HON'BLE COURT MAY BE PLEASED TO QUASH THE
COMPLAINT FILED BY THE RESPONDENT NO.2 IN PCR NO.
28348/10 ON THE FILE OF THE VI ACMM., BANGALORE
WHICH IS SUBSEQUENTLY REGD., AS CR. NO.249/10 BY
THE RESPONDENT NO.1 ULSOORGATE P.S., BANGALORE
CITY, IN SO FAR AS IT RELATES TO THE PETITIONERS
WHO ARE ARRAYED AS ACCUSED NO.5 AND 6 IN THE
PRIVATE COMPLAINT.

     THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR ADMISSION THIS
DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:



                       ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The petitioners, said to be A-5 and A-6 in the

private complaint, seeks quashing of the proceedings

against them pending on the file of the VI Addl. C.M.M.,

Bangalore in P.C.R.No.28348/10.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.    Learned counsel for the petitioners submits

that, even a perusal of the complaint, which is at Annex-

A, will not make out any case against the petitioners

and moreover the complainant's main grievance is

against A-1, A-3 and A-4 and not against the petitioners
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               3</span>



and because the petitioners are also included in an

omnibus manner in the complaint without specifying

the particular act of these petitioners, the question of

there being any allegation against the petitioners does

not arise to attract any one of the offences alleged in the

complaint viz., 420, 506 and 506-B r/w 34 of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>.

Moreover, in respect of cheques said to have been issued

to the complainant by A-3, the complainant has taken

necessary steps u/s 138 of the N.I.Act and as such, the

proceedings be quashed in respect of the present

petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      3.       Having thus heard the learned counsel for

the petitioners and the learned Government Pleader for

the respondent-State and on a perusal of the complaint

contents, there is enough force in the submission put

forward by the petitioners' counsel. In the complaint, at

para.4 it is stated that, it was A-3 who had issued the

cheques numbering 7 to the complainant and those

cheques have been dishonoured. In respect of the said

act, the complainant has taken steps under the 138 Act
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             4</span>



proceedings.    As far as the present petitioners are

concerned, except saying in a general term at paras.8

and 9 about phone calls having been made, there is no

other particulars given as to which of the petitioners and

on what date they threatened the complainant.


</p><p id="p_6">       Under the above circumstances, proceeding with

the present petitioners therefore will not be in the

interest of justice and hence the proceedings stand

quashed as regards the petitioners are concerned in

Cr.No.249/10.
