<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT
 

The following judgments were handed down.
</p> 

<p id="p_2">MAY L.J. - This is an appeal against an order of Walton J., made on 20 January 1986 and entered on 18 February 1986 reversing in part the decision of a special commissioner on an appeal by the Crown by way of case stated under section 56 of the Taxes Management Act 1970. On 30 and 31 January and 1 February 1984 the commissioner heard the appeals on the taxpayer against 21 assessments to income tax under Schedule E set out in the Income and corporation <a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_1">Taxes Act</a> 1970 for the fiscal years 1958-59 to 1978-79 inclusive (the "employment years"). On 2 August 1984 the commissioner determined the appeals by discharging the assessments for the year 1958-59 to 1977-78 inclusive and by reducing that for 1978-79 to the agreed figure of sterlling pound 8,111, being the excess over 10,000 of the aggregate moneys in dispute and accepted by the taxpayer as liable to tax pursuant to <a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_2">section 187</a> and <a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_3">188</a> of the Act 1970.
</p> 

<p id="p_3">The relevant statutory provisions are limited. Under case 1 of Schedule E in <a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_4">section 181(1)</a> of the Act (although amended in immaterial respects in relation to foreign emoluments in 1974 and again in 1977), tax under the Schedule is chargeable in respect of any office or employment on any "emoluments therefrom for a chargeable period. <a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_5">Section 183(1)</a> defines "emoluments" as including "all salaries, fee, wages, perquisites and profits whatsoever." <a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_6">Section 526(5)</a> defines "chargeable period" as "an accounting period of a company or a year of assessment." In the instant case. As the taxpayer is not a company, we are thus concerned with years of assessment.
</p> 

<p id="p_4">The background to this case can be shortly stated in the words of the commissioner in the case stated which I gratefully adopt. The taxpayer was employed from a date fiscal year 1958-59 to 1 April 1979 (in the fiscal year 1978-79) by A. Gallenkamp and Co. Ltd. ("the company"). On the latter date he, and all the other employees of the company, transferred to the employ of the company parent company. Just before that transferred and in anticipation of it, the trustees of two trusts for the benefit of the companys employees exercised their powers to bring onto effect provision leading to the winding up of the trust and the distribution of their net asset. In the course of the next fiscal year 1979-80, the taxpayer became entitled, pursuant to the exercise of discretions vested in the trustees of each of the said trust, to two sums totalling Sterlling Pound 18,111, a part of the trust funds. On those facts the taxpayer accepted liability to income tax for the year of assessment 1978-79 in respect of the two sums under <a href="/doc/1694848/" id="a_7">section 187</a> of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act, 1970, that is to say tax only on the excess over 10,000 : <a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_8">section 188</a> (3). The revenue, Ã¨however, took the view that the sums were emoluments of or from the taxpayer, employment with the company within the charges. The questions for the commissioners decision were therefore : (i) whether. In relations to the taxpayers employment with the company, the payments were "emoluments therefrom" within <a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_9">section 181(1)</a> and if so (ii) whether in relation to the words in that subsection "for the chargeable as period" in case 1 of Schedule E, (A) the payment should be treated as income of different chargeable periods and spread accordingly over the whole of the period of the taxpayers employment-the course actually adopted by the revenue or the year of assessment 1978-79 - the last year of such employment - was the sole chargeable period and the whole of the payments constituted income of that year; or (c) the payments could be attributed to any one or more of the years of assessment during which the taxpayer was employed by the company and there was accordingly no chargeable period within the meaning of the statue. In so as the last sub-paragraph is concerned, the issue was whether the receipt of the sterlling pound18,111 by the taxpayer should properly be attributed to the fiscal year 1979-80 (the "distribution year"), during which period there was no employment, that is to say no source for any emolument which would mean that the receipt could not be chargeable to tax.
</p> 

<p id="p_5">The commissioner first held the moneys received by the taxpayer from the trustees were emoluments from his employment. This point is no longer disputed. But the commissioner then held that the emoluments could not be attributed to any one or more of the relevant employment year from 1958 to 1979. It followed that there could be no chargeable period for the reason for the reason I have indicated.
</p> 

<p id="p_6">The revenue than asked for a case stated and appealed the commissioners findings against it. It seems that the taxpayer in his turn also argued before Walton J., that the moneys he had received are not emoluments from his employment. The judge rejected this contention and, as I have said, it is no longer persisted in. On the other point. However, the judge allowed the appeal against the commissioners decision. He expressed his reason for allowing the appeal in these terms :
</p> 

<p id="p_7">"given that the payments in question are emoluments arising from the taxpayers employment by the company, is it possible to attribute a year or year of assessment to such payments ? The special commissioner decided this question in the negative, and I have a great deal of sympathy with him in this conclusion, but I find the simple submission of counsel for the Crown that this conclusion is logically indefensible wholly convincing. If paid for service as an employee, it must be paid in respect of some period of service, whether that be a definable special period or whether, on the other hand, the payments have to be regarded as spread over the whole of the period of service of the employee. Of course, having regard to the precise facts of this case it may be (and, Indeed, I think it is) extremely difficult to say in Ã¨respect of precisely what period of service these payments were made; that is to say, the additional emoluments were paid. But that they must be attributed to some is, in view, inescapable."
</p> 

<p id="p_8">He went on to say that he regarded the matter as being a pure question of fact and one which the commissioner had to determine notwithstanding that the latter had expressly said that this very difficult, if not impossible. The taxpayer now appeals, seeking to have Walton J.s decision on the second principal set aside and the commissioners order reinstated.
</p> 

<p id="p_9">For the purposes of this judgment I think it unnecessary to refer to the detailed terms of the two relevant trust deeds and deeds of variation. These details are very helpfully set out in Walton J.s judgment to which reference can be made if necessary, under the first trust deed as amended over the years of the company eligible to become benefit ciaries on the determination of the trust were in general those who were employees on both 31 December 1977 and the termination date, 1 April 1979. Under the second trust deed as similarly amended, the eligible employees were those who were such on both 31 December 1975 and the termination date. The resolutions of the trustees of each fund allocating specific sums to the respective eligible employees were not made until 21 December 1979.
</p> 

<p id="p_10">As will have been seen, the commissioner relied on what is known as the "source doctrine," There is no doubt that it exists and is established by authority : it was not challenged by the Crown in this appeal. See Whitman and Wheatcroft on Income Tax, 2nd, ed. (1976), p. 21, para. 1 -28.
</p> 

<p id="p_11">"most types of income are classified by reference to the source from which they come. From this it was held to follow that if a taxpayer ceased to possess a particular source of income, he could not be taxed on delayed receipt from that source unless these were referable to, and could be assessed in respect of, a period during which he possessed the source."
</p> 

<p id="p_12">The reason the judge gave for allowing the second part of the appeal, which I have quoted, reflected a submission made to him by counsel for the Crown and repeated before us. The submission was based on what was said to be both logic and authority. It was contended that an emolument which is a reward for services is an emolument for that period during which the service were rendered. Where the period of the service extends into two or more years, then a fair apportionment on all the fact is necessary. In the present case, the emolument, which was reward for service rendered during the period of employment, which was either the whole 21 employment years or at least, in the alternative, the period of eligibility stipulated for each trust, the authorities relied on were principally Hunter v. Dewhurst (1930) 16 T. C. 605; Dracup v. Radcliff (1946) 27 T. C. 188; Heasman v. Jordan [1954] v. Ch. 744 and Board of Inland Revenue v. Suite {1986] A. C. 657. Hunter v .Dewhurst, 16 T.C. was also relied on by counsel for the taxpayer before us. It concerned the correct treatment for income tax purpose of payment received by three retiring directors of a limited company. The relevant artical of Ã¨the companys articles provided that if any director, who had held office for not less than five years should resign, than the company should pay him or his representatives by way of compensation for loss of office a sum equal to the total remuneration received by him in the preceding five years. All the three directors concerned had held office for not less than five years. Each of the first two directors involved, Arthur Foster and Joseph Foster. Simply resigned and received from the company as "compensation" a payment calculated in accordance with the relevant article. When their cases reached the court of Appeal the latter held that the payments received by them were emoluments from their employment and assessable in the year of receipt, rather than "compensation for loss of office" as had been the decision of the special commissioners and Rowlatt J., on their appeals by way of case stated, it had been argued that if payments were emoluments, then they should be distributed or spread over not less than the five years referred to in the article. In rejecting this contention Lord Hanworth M. R., said, at p. 630 :
</p> 

<p id="p_13">"The last point that I need refer to is the one which was put forward very cogently by Mr. Grant, namely, that if the sum is payable it must be distributed over the year during which the qualification for it must be distributed over the years during which the qualification for it lasted, that is to say, not less than five years. To my mind interesting as that argument may be, it is fallacious. There are certain conditions to be fulfilled before the sum as a totality falls to be paid, but when the conditions have been fulfilled the sum as a total is to be paid. There is no indication that is to be distributed over the number of years served. It seems that after the appropriate period of five years service in the one company or the other had been complete. The director become entitled to receive this sum, if and when his directorship came to an end, or he died but he might continue to be a director for another there or four or five years, and are you to say when ultimately the sum is paid, that it is distributable over the number of year respectively during which service as a director has been fulfilled ? I do not think so. It seems to me that the conditions, once they are fulfilled, entitle the director to a lump sum by way of deferred payment. And that deferred payment cannot be split up into component parts for there is no scheme or system laid down in <a href="/doc/729393/" id="a_10">article 109</a> whereby that can be done."
</p> 

<p id="p_14">In his judgment Lawrence L.J., said, at p. 632 :
</p> 

<p id="p_15">"Now the sum which was paid to the respondent, in my judgment, arose and accrued in the last year of the office of director and is therefore properly included in the assessment which was made upon him for the year of assessment, 1925-1926, as a profit from the office in that year, and is not distributable, as has been suggested, either over the whole term of service of the respondent or over the last five year of such service."
</p> 

<p id="p_16">Finally, Romer L.J., said at p. 633 :
</p> 

<p id="p_17">"Now, supposing that a director is employed upon the terms that he is to be paid in each year of his service a sum of pound 1,000 and in the last year of his service a sum of Ã¨pound 5,000 in addition to the pound 1,000 no one think could doubt in such a case that the pound 5,000 was a profit of his office paid to him in such a case that the pound 5,000 was profit of his office paid to him in respect of his office, that it was liable to income tax, and was to be treated for the purposes of tax as forming part of his salary for the last year of his officer, the case, before us is precisely that case, with two exceptions. Firstly, that the sum is not fixed, but has to be ascertained by reference to events which will not be determined until the last year of office - that can make no difference at all - and secondly, that <a href="/doc/729393/" id="a_11">article 109</a> expresses that the sum to be paid in the last year of office is to be compensation for loss of office. Now, do those words make any difference ? In my opinion they do not."
</p> 

<p id="p_18">The Court of Appeal reached the same conclusion in respect of the third director involved, Commander Dewhurst, although the facts of his case were substantially different. On a further appeal the House of Lords held by a majority that the sums he had received were truly compensation for loss of office and not income assessable to income tax. In these circumstances counsel for the Crown before us, whilst accepting that the facts of the Commanders case had been different from his two condirectors, nevertheless contended that the House of Lords had clearly indicated a view different form that of the Court of Appeal, and that at the highest the passages from the judgments in the court of Appeal, which I have quoted should be treated as no more than obiter dicta, if not as actually wrong in law. However their Lordship is the majority in Commander Dewhursts case expressly said that the case had to be decided on its own special circumstances and left open the question of the correctness or otherwise of the decision of the Court of Appeal in the cases two directors. In any cases the difference was as between compensations for loss of office on the one hand and an emolument from employment on the other : no view was expressed in the House of Lords about the validity of the view of the Court of Appeal that the emolument, if such it was could not be spread over the five year period and I regard the judgment in the Court of Appeal on this point as part of the ratio of the Courts decision and thus at least clearly persuasive on us when we have to consider the similar point in the instant appeal.
</p> 

<p id="p_19">In Dracup v. Radcliffe, 27 TC 188 the appellant was appointed director of a company on 18 May 1942. An assessment was raised for the year 1942-43 on remuneration voted to her on 28 July 1942 in respect of her service from her date of appointment to the end of the company year on 30 June 1942, and on the proportion to 5 April 1943, of the remuneration for the year to 30 June 1943, voted to her on 27 July 1943. The appellant contended that the assessment should be based on the remuneration voted on 28 July 1942, and no more. Dismissing her appeal, MacNaghten J. thought that the case raised merely a Ã¨question of fact to which the answer was clear. I respectfully agree and do not think the judge sought to apply any relevant principle of law. He dealt with the case entirely on its own facts which were very different from those in the instant case.
</p> 

<p id="p_20">In Heasman v. Jordan [1954] Ch. 744 the appellant taxpayer was employed by a firm of aircraft manufacturers. He entered their employment on 21 May 1941 and was paid on a monthly basis. During the years 1941-45 the members of the monthly staff worked long hours for 61/2 days a week and without normal holidays, for which they received no overtime a result of a resolution of the board of directors of the received no overtime a result of a resolution of the board of directors of the company dated 27 of pound 1,250 expressed to be a mark of "appreciation of the loyalty and industry of the monthly staff during the war years in then loyalty and industry of the monthly staff during the war years in the form of a gratuity." On the taxpayers appeal against an assessment under Schedule E for the year in which the bonus was received, Roxburgh J., held that there was no statutory presumption one way or the other; it was a question of fact in each case. On the facts of the case before him he held that it was clear that the bonus had not been intended to be a reward for service in the year of receipt only, but for the appellants services during the war since his appointment on 21 May 1941. He therefore remitted the case for adjustment of the assessment accordingly.
</p> 

<p id="p_21">In my opinion this decision is no authority for the wide principle contended for in the instant appeal. I think that it merely reiterated that it is a question of fact in each case. On the facts of the two cases to which I have just been referring it is wholly understandable that they should have been decided as they were. In so far as is relevant to the present appeal I do not think that in Board of Inland Revenue v. Suite [1986] A. C. 657 the Privy Council did any more than agree with the factual approach adopted in both the Dracup and Heasman cases.
</p> 

<p id="p_22">On behalf of the taxpayer before us. Mr. Park submitted that the judge had been wrong in stating the principle as he had. Emoluments for purposes relevant to this case, it was argued, can be put into one of three categories : (i) for specific or services rendered in a specific period or periods and thus properly assessable as income for the period or period in which the services were rendered; (ii) those which arise from the employment but are paid for services in the employment. These can only be taxed for the year of assessment in which they are paid : whether they can be so assessed is subject to an operation of the source doctrine, and (iii) those which arise from the employment and are to some extent remuneration for service but only services generally, not for any specific services in way specific period.
</p> 

<p id="p_23">In support of these submissions we were referred first to Brumby v. Milner [1976] 1 W. L. R. 1096. Walton J., held that the present case differed only in one way; namely. That the sums were paid after the terminations of the employment rather then during it. He held, however, that for present purpose this was a distinction by any other Ã¨reason for making them that service as an employee. The facts of Brumbys case wer indeed very similar. A public company set up trust for the benefit of its employees. It was a genuine profit sharing scheme. There was power to terminate on one years notice and then to distribute the net balance of the trust fund among the employees determine otherwise in equal shares. Ultimately the House of Lords decide that the payments employment and nothing else. It was because of this authority that the taxpayer in the instant appeal no long argues the first point, namely, that the relevant receipt was not an emolument from employment. However in Brumbys case the taxpayer had been assessed for only one year, namely, that of the year of receipt and this was at a time when his employment was still in existence, therefore there was no suggestion that the amount received should be spread over the years of in the any way. It will be apparent that there is a substantial difference in the facts of the instant case. For when the relevant moneys were received, in the distribution year, the moneys and thus it is contended that they were not assessable.
</p> 

<p id="p_24">That an emolument from an employment is not necessarily one for service or services is shown by the decision in Hamblett v. Godfrey [1987] 1 W. G.C.H.Q. und employees for relinquishing trade union membership. The taxpayer in that case said, rightly, that her pound 1,000 was not remuneration for services, and argued that therefore it was not an emolument. This contention was upheld by the special commissioners. However on appeal knox [1986] 1 W. L. R. 839 held to the contrary that the payment was an emolument, that it was from the employment and that it was accordingly assessable under Schedule E. The court of Appeal upheld the judges decision. Neill L. J. said [1987] 1 W. L. R. 357, 370;
</p> 

<p id="p_25">"Thus these passages, as well as those to which Purchas L.J., has already referred in greater detail, demonstrate to my mind that emoluments from employment are not restricted to payments made in return for the performance of services."
</p> 

<p id="p_26">We were referred to a number of other cases in which payments found to be emoluments from a taxpayers employment were nevertheless held not to have been paid for service as an employee in that employment. In each case the payments were assessed once only in the year of the receipt of money or the relevant perquisite. It was never argued they could or should, be spread over a period of years on the basis of Walton J.s challenged reasoning in this case. Thus these cases are no direct authority in support of the submission that the judge was wrong. However, if his reasoning could be supported. I find it surprising that the point was not taken in these cases, to have spread the payments and receipt over a period in these cases. To have spread the payments and receipt over a period of years could only have been for the benefit of the taxpayer : see Edwards v. Roberts [1934] 19 T. C. 618; Dale v. de Seissons [1950] 32 T. C. 118; Abbott v. Philbin [1961] A. C. 352 and Tyrer v. Smart [1979] 1 W. L. R. 113. In my respectful opinion. Therefore, the judges Ã¨conclusion that an emolument from an employment must of necessity and as a matter of law be attributed to a period or periods of that employment is erroneous. I think that the year of assessment to which to attribute such an emolument is a question of fact to be decided in the light of all the circumstances of the particular case. From the very nature of an emolument from an employment it may well be that in most case this has indeed to be attributed to a year or particular years of the employment. But this does not necessarily follow. In the instant case the commissioner has made a finding that there was no justification on the facts to attribute all or any part of the relevant receipts to the year of assessment 1978-79-years back to 1958-59. The commissioner has in effect made a finding that the receipt of the relevant moneys was attributable to the distribution year, but that the taxpayer was not then employed. There was no source in that year, and thus no liability to tax, that is a finding which cannot be disturbed on appeal save on Edwards v. Bairstow [1956] A. C. 14 principles, which no one suggests are applicable. In any event I respectfully agree with the finding of the commissioner which accords with common sense. I further agree with the contention put in the course of argument that prima facie a receipt of a emolument is assessable in the year it was received, unless grounds of an emolument is assessable in the year it was period exist. The commissioner has held that none existed in the instant case and I agree.
</p> 

<p id="p_27">Finally, the correctness of the commissioners view can perhaps be tested by asking how any apportionment would be made if it had to be made, clearly the process would be a very difficult one. On the evidence the trustees had to assess the amounts to be paid to each recipient on the basis of their information assessment not based on any strict arithmetical grounds of a fair distribution. This despite the fact that they had previously obtained several computer printouts showing the effect of applying various formulae to ascertainable factors such as length of service and seniority, and then of scaling down maximum benefits in various ways. If the trustees themselves acted so, I think that it would be impossible to attribute the moneys which they ultimately resolved to pay to some one or more years of the taxpayers employment on any rational basis which the courts could support.
</p> 

<p id="p_28">In this case, in the first instance the revenue attributed the taxpayers relevant receipt to the distribution year. When it appreciated its difficulty under the source doctrine it sought to apportion the receipt over the whole 21 years of the taxpayers employment. In argument counsel for the Crown sought to suggest that if this were incorrect, then the receipt should be attributable either to the eligibility periods under the respective trust deeds. Or finally to the day when the trusts were terminated and the trustees obligations to determine the various entitlements arose. However if the revenues first or second choice cannot be substantiated. I for my part would be averse to giving them a third, or possibly a Ã¨fourth opportunity to get it right.
</p> 

<p id="p_29">For all these reasons I would allow the taxpayers appeal, set aside Walton J.s order and reinstate the decision of the special commissioner.
</p> 

<p id="p_30">BALCOMBE L.J. I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of May L.J., and agree with him that this appeal should be allowed. As we are differing from the judgment of Walton J. I add a few words of my own.
</p> 

<p id="p_31">I accept the final submission of Mr. Park, for the taxpayer, before us, that the logical sequence of the questions which fall to be answered in this case is as follows : (i) was the sum sterlling pound 18,111 paid to the taxpayer by the trustee of the employees trust funds pursuant to resolutions, dated 21 December 1979, i.e., during the fiscal year 1979-80, an emolument from his employment by the company ? The taxpayer has not appealed from the finding that this was an emolument, so that the answer to this question is in the affirmative; (ii) to which year or year of assessment should this emolument be attributed ? This is the sole issue which we have to decide. (iii) did the source of income exist during the year or year in question ? The Crown now accepts that if the payment is to be attributed to the fiscal year 1979-80 then there was no source in that year and the "source doctrine" precludes a charge to income-tax under Schedule E.
</p> 

<p id="p_32">Accordingly I return to the second question. [His Lordship read the passage in which Walton J., dealt with that question and continued] Unlike the judge. I am quite unable to accept that it logically follows that if a payment is made to an employee for services generally, and not for some specific services or for service during a specific period, then that payment must be made in respect of some period of service. For from this conclusion being inescapable, it seems to me that, approaching the matter without reference to the decided cases, a payment which is, whether is whole or in part, for service generally, should be attributed to the year in which it is paid unless there is material which enables one to say that it should be attributed to some other period or periods.
</p> 

<p id="p_33">In the present case the commissioner made the following finding of fact as to the basis on which the trustees of the funds arrived at the payment of Sterlling pound 18, 111 to the taxpayer :
</p> 

<p id="p_34">"Between April and December 1979 the trustees of each fund arrived at the allocations to be made to their respective eligible employees in accordance with paragraph 2 of the Schedule In so doing. They were at pains to arrive at a division which was as fair as possible, and which would be seen in that light by the beneficiaries. To this end, several computer printouts were obtained showing the effect of applying various formulae which attached different respective weights to length of service with the company and salary levels, and the effect of limiting or scaling down the maximum benefits in various ways. Both sets of trustees concluded that none of the printouts produced a wholly acceptable pattern, but that one of them provided a useful basis for further discussions. In the event both sets of trustees agreed on substantial departures from the figures yielded by applying the formula underlying the computer printout which appeared to Ã¨the most appropriate, and in particular printout which appeared to be the most appropriate, and in particular they agreed on a cut-off point, thus releasing funds for distribution pro rata to points lower down the scale, thereby reducing differentials. In the result, the total of the allocation made to the taxpayer (pound 18, 111) was some pound 3,300 greater then it und would have been if both sets of trustees had simply adopted the figures produced by the best of the computer printouts."
</p> 

<p id="p_35">From these findings it seems to me quite impossible to say that the payment can be attributed to any particular period or periods of the taxpayers service with the company. I accept Mr. Parks submission that the payment in this case, although in some part by way of remuneration for services-and thus distinguishable from cases such a Hamblett v. Godfrey [1987] 1 W. L. R. 357 where the sum in question, although an emolument, was not in any sense a payment for services-was, in so far as it was in payment for service or any generally or any specific period. Thus conclusion is supported by the auhorities. In Hunter v. Dewhurst. 16 T. C. 605, payments had been made to a director of a company when he resigned from office, which it was held by the Court of Appeal constituted a profit of the office of director and assessable to income-tax under Schedule E, the assessment had been made in respect of the last year of office when the sum in question had been paid, but the taxpayer argued that it should be attributed to the whole, or because of the particular way in which the sum was calculated, the last five years of his service as a director. The Court of Appeal dealt with this argument in the judgment of Lord Hanworth M. R. at pp. 630-631, and Lawrence L.J., at p. 632 : In fairness to the judge. I should say that he was not referred to this case by either party.
</p> 

<p id="p_36">In Abbott v. Philbin [1961] A. C. 352 an employee had given as option to purchase shares in the company by which he was employed. It was held that the option was an emolument received by him by virtue of the his employment. And the question arose whether he should be assessed for the year of assessment in which he received the option, or on the profit he made during the year of assessment when he excrcised the op tion. The majority in the House of Lords held that the taxable receipt be assessed on its monetary value, if any, at the date of its acquisition and for the year of assessment which included that date. In the course of his speech Lord Reid said, at p. 372 :
</p> 

<p id="p_37">"If a reward is given in the form of a option and the option is itself the perquisite. It would generally be sufficiently related to the year in which it give to be properly regarded as a perquisite for that year."
</p> 

<p id="p_38">Since in that case the options had been granted to certain employees of the company, it is reasonable to infer that they were granted, in part at any rate, by way of reward for services generally rendered to the company by those employees.
</p> 

<p id="p_39">Heasman v. Jordan [1955] Ch. 744 is an example of a case where on the facts. It was clear that the payment in question were attributable to particular year of service, and so were properly apportioned between the years of assessment in which those years of service fell : see in Ã¨particular the judgment of Roxburgh J., at p. 752 :
</p> 

<p id="p_40">"What, therefore, are the facts here ? The bonus was not calculates with reference to output in the year of assessment, nor were all members of the staff in one salary group paid equal amounts. The bonus was correlated with the length of service of the particular member of the staff during the war years, and it was limited to the monthly-staff to the exclusion of the weekly-staff. Where a particular member of the staff had been transferred during the war period from weekly payment to monthly payment of remuneration, only his monthly service was taken into consideration. The bonus was given in pursuance of a promise which had been reiterated in many directions over many years. The very terms of the letter which accompanied the payments clearly show that the bonus was not intended to be a reward for service rendered in that particular year of assessment only."
</p> 

<p id="p_41">Dracup v. Radcliffe, 27 T. C. 188 is another example of a case which turned on its particular facts.
</p> 

<p id="p_42">I do not need to refer to the other authorities mentioned by May L.J. save to say that in respect of Edwards v. Roberts, 19 T. C. 618 Dale v. de Soissons, 32 T.C. 118 and Tyrer v. Smart [1996] 1 W. L. R. 113, it is surprising, to say the least, that the argument now advanced by the Crown and accepted by the judge was not in any of those cases advanced by the taxpayer, to whose manifest advantage it would have been to have had his benefit apportioned over a number of years of assessment, corresponding to his period of service.
</p> 

<p id="p_43">Finally, it seems to me that, if the sum of Sterlling pound 18, 111 in this case is to be apportioned as having been paid in respect of some period of the taxpayers service with the company, it should be possible for the court to state, for the guidance of the commissioner who has to make the apportionment, the principles which he should apply in so doing. This I find it quite impossible to do in the light of the light of the finding by the commissioner, to which I have referred above, as to the basis on which the trustees of the funds arrived at their decision. Mr. Potter for the Crown submitted that there are three possible bases for an apportionment : (a) over the years of eligibility. In the case of one fund, the general fund, to be eligible to benefit from the distribution a person had to have been employed by the company at the termination date (29 March 1979) and have been so employed on December 31, 1977. In that case the period of eligibility was some 15 months. In the case of other (Harry Jarrom) fund, the period of eligibility was from December 13, 1975 to March 29, 1979. Some 39 month; (b) over the whole period of the employment of each individual by the company. In the case of the taxpayer this amounted to 21 years and was the Crowns second choice in this case; (c) to a particular date, viz March 29, 1979, the day on which the trust terminated and when an employee finally completed his qualification. These widely differing possibilities, none of which is obviously preferable to any of the others, demonstrate to me impossibility in the present case of attributing the payment of Sterlling pound 18, 111 to any year of Ã¨assessment other than that in which it was paid. That is the year to which it is prima facie attributable, and it is only the application of the "source doctrine" which prevents it being assessed for that year.
</p> 

<p id="p_44">Accordingly I agree that the appeal should be allowed the order of Walton J., set aside and the commissioners decision restored.
</p> 

<p id="p_45">WOOLF L.J. I also agree this appeal should be allowed I do however recognise the force of Walton J.s reasoning and initially I was of the view that it was correct.
</p> 

<p id="p_46">As Viscount Simonds pointed out in Abbott v. Philbin [1961] A.C. 352,367 it is a
 

"notoriously difficult problem as to the year to which for the purpose of tax a payment should be ascribed, if it is not expressly ascribed is any particular year."
</p> 

<p id="p_47">It is therefore important as stated in both the judgments of May and Blacombe L.JJ., which I have seen in draft, to adopt the prima facie approach that an emolument is assessable for the year of assessment is which it is received unless there are grounds for attributing it to some other period. Where, however, an emolument in respect of an employment is received in a year of assessment which commenced after the date of termination of that employment, this could be regarded in itself as being grounds for attributing the payment to an earlier year of assessment during which the employment existed since what is being assessed is the emolument from that employment. This approach accords with the scheme of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970. Emoluments from any office or employment would be charged under <a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_12">section 181</a> for a chargeable period or period falling within the period of employment and payments to a past holder of employment could be chargeable under <a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_13">section 187</a> of the Act. Sub-section (2) of which defines the payment to which the section applies in wide terms but not in terms which would necessarily apply to a emoluments paid after the termination of the employment if they were no inevitably chargeable under <a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_14">section 181</a> contrary to the contention of the Crown. The terms of <a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_15">section 187(2)</a> (with my emphasis) are :
</p> 

<p id="p_48">"This section applies to any payment (not otherwise chargeable to tax) which is made. Whether in pursuance of any legal obligation or no either directly in consideration or in consequence of, or otherwise in connection with, the termination of the holding of the office employment or any change in its functions or emoluments, including any payment in commutation of annual or payments (whether chargeable to tax or not) which would otherwise have made as aforesaid."
</p> 

<p id="p_49">None of the authorities referred to by counsel for the taxpayer or in Crown debar such an approach. They do not deal with emolument received by an employee in a year of assessment after the employment ceased. At most it can be said about the authorities that it is surprising that if the approach now adopted by the Crown and which was accepted buy the judge is correct no hint of this appears is any earlier decision dealing with this difficult subject. However this not the first time and it will not be the last that if the Crown is correct in the arguments which they advance they have to concede that they have only recently identified the proper approach.
</p> 

<p id="p_50">However, if the approach is correct, then it is difficult to identify any scope for the application of the so-called Ã¨"source doctrine". A doctrine, the existence of which Mr. Potter did not seek to dispute, and which, as Mr. Park pointed out, is now of some long standing and apparently still applied by the Crown in respect of some other categories of former employees.
</p> 

<p id="p_51">Furthermore if the solution contended for by the Crown and accepted by the judge is adopted, there has to be some method by which the emoluments can be attributed to an earlier chargeable period or periods during which the employment still existed. Mr. Potter submitted that which period or periods was applicable was a question of fact to be determinated by the commissioner on the case being referred back to him as was ordered by the judge Mr. Potter proffered three possible choice of decision as being available to the commissioner : (a) the payment should be spread equally over the years during which the taxpayer became qualified to receive the payment; or (c) the date of termination of the employment which was the date on which the taxpayer become eligible to receive the payment. Of these three choice Mr. Potter was unable to identify the one which produced the right answer or any principle or presumption or guide which would assist in providing the correct results and he candidly conceded that his preferred choice changed from time to time. May and Balcombe L.JJ., have referred to the difficulties which the commissioner found in seeking to perform this exercise before he came to his decision, and this appeal has made clear that if the judges decision is right absurd situations could arise in cases where, as here, there really is no material upon which a rational allocation of the payment can be made to an earlier chargeable period or periods during which the employment existed. The task would not merely be a difficult one-special commissioners are frequently faced and are used to dealing with extremely difficult tasks-but one which would be completely haphazard. As the period or periods over which the payment is spread can affect the quantum of tax which is payable this consequence is highly undesirable. Particularly because, as here, there can be a number of employees in a similar situation, so unless appropriate administrative steps are taken different commissioners could select periods for different employees on identical facts and their decision would be unimpeachable and incapable of being disturbed on appeal.
</p> 

<p id="p_52">Fortunately this court is not compelled to uphold an approach to this appeal which would have such highly undesirable consequences. As the judgments of May and Balcombe L.JJ., make clear, the earlier the decisions on this difficult subject, which not conclusive, are wholly consistent with the conclusion reached by the commissioner. The existence of the source doctrine makes it possible for an emolument received after the termination of the employment to be not chargeable under <a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_16">section 181</a> where, as here, there are no circumstances apart from the termination of the employment, suggesting any chargeable period other than the chargeable period during which the payment was made, the case where it will Ã¨be not possible to identify any earlier chargeable period should be few but in those cases the correct solution is not to require the commissioners to come to a decision for which there is no logical justification but to treat the payment as falling into charge in the year of assessment when it is paid albeit that this has the result that no tax will be assessable thereon under <a href="/doc/644534/" id="a_17">section 181</a>. It is on this basis that I agree, for the reasons given in the judgments of May and Balcombe L.JJ., that this appeal must be allowed.
