<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT
 

 A.K. Yog, J. 
</p> 

<p id="p_2"> Order on Writ Petition
 

 Admit. Issue notice. 
</p> 

<p id="p_3">  Order of Stay Application
 

</p><p id="p_4"> 1. Through this petition. Committee of Management said to be represented by one Raj Dhar Dubey, petitioner alleges that there is an Institution called Misri Lal Inter College, Mawanyan, Mirzapur, which is being governed by the provisions of U. P. Intermediate Education Act, regulation framed thereunder, (for short called the Act) and duly approved Scheme of Administration. Copy of Scheme of Administration has been filed as Annexure No. 1 to the petition. 
</p> 

<p id="p_5"> 2. Petitioner alleges that an election for constituting Committee of Management of the Institution took place on 25.8.1996 but respondent No. 3, (one Ram Singh) raised dispute and matter was referred to the Deputy Director of Education as contemplated under Section 16A (7) of the Act. It is further stated that some dates were fixed by the said authority but matter was not decided. 
</p> 

<p id="p_6"> 3. Ultimately petitioner filed a representation before concerned authority to decide representation. The concerned authority pointed out that respondent No. 3 throughout absented and did not appear on any fixed date In spite of notice. And in that view, petitioner requested the authority should decide the matter on merit without waiting for his appearance. 
</p> 

<p id="p_7"> 4. It is alleged in the petition that petitioner was forced to file Writ Petition No. 21773 of 1999 and learned single Judge of this Court vide judgment and order dated 25.5.1999 directed the concerned authority (respondent No. 1) to decide the matter within six months from the date of production of a certified copy of this order (Annexure-6 to the petition). 
</p>
 

<p id="p_8"> 5. Respondent No. 1 has decided the dispute under Section 16A (7) of the Act vide order dated August 10, 1999. 
</p> 

<p id="p_9"> 6. At the outset I would like to mention that authority has not tendered explanation whatsoever for not passing order within time granted by this Court vide Judgment and order dated 25.5.1999. There is nothing on record for perusal of this Court at this stage as to why the authority did not comply with the order of this High Court. It Is expected that an authority while deciding the matter shall also tender explanation for consideration of the Court or of higher authority showing a justifiable cause for not complying with the direction of the High Court. This is the least that an authority Is expected to do. As otherwise, 'concerned authority' should approach High Court for seeking extension of time by giving facts justifying extension of time. 
</p> 

<p id="p_10"> 7. Without going into the merit of the case. 1 am of the opinion that the concerned authority did not decide the matter of dispute expeditlously and completely failed to achieve the object for which legislature Incorporated Section 16A (7) of the Act. Even If parties succeed after expiry of term under law. the college suffers in silence. The dispute remains at its own place. Existence of dispute pertaining to the management of educational institution, precipitating continuous flow of writ petitions compels this Court to take Judicial notice of the same. Provision of Section 16A (7) has been misused both by the private litigant as well as educational authorities. 
</p> 

<p id="p_11"> 8. It is high time. State Government should give a serious thought. As otherwise the pitiable condition of education in the State is bound to be reduced to a brazen dismal. 
</p> 

<p id="p_12"> 9. Coming to the present case. I find that authorities failed to decide the dispute and by inaction has rendered itself unfit by passively abusing its official position. 
</p> 

<p id="p_13"> 10.   In     the     totality    of    the circumstances,   I direct the petitioner

and learned Standing Counsel to submit a certified copy of this Judgment before District Magistrate, who shall immediately take over charge of the Management of the Institution himself or through an official appointed by him. who shall Immediately convene a meeting of the General Body, which shall elect itself an ad hoc Committee not exceeding three members and District Magistrate shall command the said Committee to get the election held in accordance with the Scheme of Administration as expedltlously as possible but in no case exceeding three months from the date of receipt of certified copy of this judgment. Entire proceedings shall be subject to supervision and control of the District Magistrate. List of life membership shall be finalised in general body meeting convened after due notice under law and also after its being published in dally News Papers having wide circulation in the locality. 
</p> 

<p id="p_14"> 11. No party shall be allowed to raise objection before elections are held, and charge is taken over by new Committee of Management. If any party has any grievance, he may file an application in this Court. 
</p>
