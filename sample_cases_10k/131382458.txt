!For Appellant                  : Mr.C.Vakeeswaran for

:JUDGMENT       
</pre>
<p id="p_1">        Heard the learned counsel on either side.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2.The vehicle owner has filed this appeal questioning the application
of pay and recover principle by the Tribunal while passing an award in favour
of the claimants.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        3.The ground on which the pay and recover principle was ordered was
that the driver of the insured vehicle was not having an endorsement to drive
the transport vehicle even though he was otherwise possessing LMV driving
license.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        4.The learned counsel appearing for the appellant placed reliance on
the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in  2017(2) TNMAC 145 (SC)
? Mukund Dewangan Vs. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd.  On the other hand, 
Mr.K.K.Ramakrishnan, learned counsel for the insurer pointed out that the
Hon'ble Supreme Court is zeised of the matter and is to take a decision on
the decision rendered in Mukund Dewangan case is to be referred to a Larger
Bench.  For this purpose, the matter is to be listed on 16.01.2018 in S.L.P.
No.27787 of 2017.  He would therefore call upon this Court to defer the
proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_5">        5.I am of the view that as on date, the issue on hand is squarely
covered by the decision in Mukund Dewangan case.  It is true that an attempt
has been made to doubt the correctness of the said decision.  The Hon'ble
Supreme Court is to take a call in the the matter on 16.01.2018.  But, on
that date, a decision to refer or not to refer alone will be taken.  Hence, I
am of the view that this case can be decided based on the position that
obtains as on date.  I therefore allow this appeal.  Permission granted to
the insurer to recover the paid amount from the vehicle owner is set aside.
</p>        
<p id="p_6">        6.The award dated 06.02.2015 made in M.C.O.P.No.403 of 2011 on the file 
of the Sub Court, Kulithalai (Motor Accident Claim Tribunal) is accordingly
modified.
</p>
<p id="p_7">        7.The third respondent insurance company is directed to deposit the
entire compensation amount of Rs.4.8000/- with interest at the rate of 7.5%
per annum, from the date of petition till the date of realization and costs,
within a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this
order, less the amount already deposited, if any.  On such deposit, the
claimants are permitted to withdraw the same as apportioned by the Tribunal
by filing proper application before the Tribunal, less the amount already
withdrawn by them, if any.
</p>

<p id="p_8">        8.This civil miscellaneous appeal stands partly allowed.  No costs.
</p>

<p id="p_9">To

</p><p id="p_10">1.The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal,
   Sub Court, Kulithalai.
