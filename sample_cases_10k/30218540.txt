<div class="doc_title">Surendra Prasad Singh vs State Of Bihar on 18 March, 2010</div><pre id="pre_1">                    IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT PATNA
                                  Cr.Misc. No.3109 of 2010
                                SURENDRA PRASAD SINGH
                                              Versus
                                      STATE OF BIHAR
                                            -----------
</pre><p id="p_1">2   18..3.2010              A supplementary affidavit has been filed on behalf of the

                 petitioner. Let it be kept on record.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                               Heard Shri Chittaranjan Sinha, learned senior counsel appearing

                 for the petitioner and Shri Ram Priyasharan, learned A.P.P. for the State.

</p><p id="p_3">                               Petitioner is an accused in a complaint case filed in the year

                 1999 in which cognizance was taken under <a href="/doc/1326844/" id="a_1">sections 409</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_2">420</a> and <a href="/doc/1128948/" id="a_3">120</a> B of

                 the Indian Penal Code. It is stated that petitioner was the Regional Manager,

                 posted at Patna of M/s Aneja Group, a non-banking company having its head

                 quarters at Hydrabad. From perusal of the complaint petition it appears that

                 Rs. 60,000/- was deposited by the complainant to the Branch manager co-

                 accused Ranjeet Kumar on the assurance that on maturity he will receive 24%

                 interest. It is also submitted that as a matter of fact no amount or money was

                 entrusted to the petitioner. Initially this court was reluctant to consider the

                 prayer for anticipatory bail made on behalf of the petitioner primarily on the

                 ground that   this case is of the year 1999 and petitioner has approached this

                 court in the year 2010 for grant of anticipatory bail. However, Mr. Sinha has

                 drawn my attention to certain orders to show         that as a matter of fact

                 petitioner had filed a petition under <a href="/doc/1245435/" id="a_4">section 205</a> Cr.P.C. in the year 2000

                 itself seeking exemption of his personal appearance, but that petition was

                 dismissed on 25.7.2006 against which a criminal revision no. 219 of 2006

                 was filed, which was also dismissed on         9.11.2009 by the learned 4th

                 Additional Sessions Judge, Muzaffarpur, and only thereafter the petitioner
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                          -2-</span>




has moved         before this Court seeking anticipatory bail.           By filing

supplementary affidavit the petitioner has brought on record order dated

20.10.2003 whereby co-accused Ranjeet Kumar was granted bail by the

learned court below on the day of his appearance on the assurance that the

complainant and co-accused Ranjeet Kumar are               relation and there was

every likelihood that the matter may be compromised between the parties.

This court is not in a position to know as to whether the matter has been

actually compromised or not.
</p>
<p id="p_4">               Learned counsel for the State has also not disputed the aforesaid

position but has submitted that some strict condition may be imposed against

the petitioner so that trial of the case itself be concluded at an early date.

</p><p id="p_5">               In the aforesaid facts and circumstances, let the above named

petitioner in the event of his arrest or surrender in the court below within

four weeks from today be released on bail on furnishing bail bond of Rs.

10,000/- (ten thousand)        with two sureties of like amount each to the

satisfaction of     Judicial Magistrate , Ist class, Muzaffarpur in complaint

case no. 1007 of 1999, subject to the conditions laid down under <a href="/doc/1144664/" id="a_5">section 438</a>

(2) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a>. and further that (a) that one of the bailors must be Govt. Servant

or close family member of the petitioner who will file an affidavit in the court

below showing his/her relationship with the petitioner. (b) if the petitioner is

found involved in same and similar nature of cases in future, then in that case

the informant/prosecution shall be at liberty to file a petition for cancellation

of the bail of the petitioner, and if such a petition is filed, the court below

would be obliged to dispose of the same in accordance with law after giving

opportunity of hearing to all concerned and (c) the petitioner shall make
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      -3-</span>




           regular pairvi in the court below in the present case either by appearing

           himself in person or through representation by his lawyer on each and every

           dates, and if on two consecutive dates petitioner fails to make pairvi, then the

           court below shall be at liberty to cancel the bail bond of the petitioner. The

           trial court is further directed to make all endeavors to conclude the trial of the

           petitioner as early as possible preferably within a period of six months and

           petitioner shall   give all cooperation in early disposal of the case. Non-

           cooperation in early disposal of the case, may result in cancellation of bail

           bond of the petitioner.
