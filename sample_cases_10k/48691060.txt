the Cr.P.C. in connection with Sutrapada Police Station,
District-Junagadh C.R.No. II-3056 of 2012 pertaining to the offences
punishable under <a href="/doc/770961/" id="a_2">Sections 323</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3">504</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">506(2)</a> read with <a href="/doc/112749/" id="a_5">Section 114</a> of
the IPC and Section 135 of the Bombay Police Act. 
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_3">3. Having considered the
submissions advanced on behalf of both the sides, so also considering
the facts and circumstances of the case and the manner in which the
offence alleged against the applicants and the punishment prescribed
for the same, the application deserves to be allowed. 
</p>
 

 


 


<p id="p_4">4.	This Court has also
taken into consideration the law laid down by the Apex Court in the
case of <a href="/doc/1108032/" id="a_6">Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre v. State of Maharashtra &amp;
Ors. Reported</a> in [2011]1 SCC 694, wherein the Apex Court
reiterated the law laid down by the Constitutional Bench in the case
of Shri Gurubaksh Singh Sibbia &amp; Ors. Reported in [1980]2
SCC 565.
</p> 
	 



 


<p id="p_5">5.	Learned counsel for
the parties do not press for further reasoned order.
</p> 
	 



 


<p id="p_6">6.	In the result, this
application is allowed by directing that in the event of the
applicants herein being arrested pursuant to FIR being Sutrapada
Police Station, District-Junagadh  C.R.No. II-3056 of 2012, the
applicants shall be released on bail on furnishing a bond of
Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) each with one surety of like
amount on following conditions :-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_7">[a]	shall cooperate
with the investigation and make themselves available for
interrogation whenever required. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_8">[b]	shall remain
present at concerned Police Station on 4.7.2012 betweens 11:00 am to
2:00 pm:
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_9">[c]	shall not hamper
the investigation in any manner nor shall directly or indirectly make
any inducement, threat or promise to any witness so as to dissuade
them from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any Police
Officer;
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_10">[d]	shall at the time
of execution of bond, furnish the address to the Investigating
Officer and the Court concerned and shall not change the residence
till the final disposal of the case or till further orders;
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_11">[e] 	will not leave
India without the permission of the Court and, if is holding a
Passport, shall surrender the same before the trial Court
immediately.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_12">[f]	It would be open
to the Investigating Officer to file an application for remand, if he
considers it just and proper and the concerned Magistrate would
decide it on merits.
</p> 


	
 


<p id="p_13">[g]	despite this
order, it would be open for the Investigating Agency to apply to the
competent Magistrate, for police remand of the applicants. The
applicants shall remain present before the learned Magistrate on the
first date of hearing of such application and on all subsequent
occasions, as may be directed by the learned Magistrate. This would
be sufficient to treat the accused in the judicial custody for the
purpose of entertaining application of the prosecution for police
remand. This is, however, without prejudice to the right of the
accused to seek stay against an order of remand, if ultimately
granted, and the power of the learned Magistrate to consider such a
request in accordance with law. It is clarified that the applicants,
even if, remanded to the police custody, upon completion of such
period of police remand, shall be set free immediately, subject to
other conditions of this anticipatory bail order.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_14">7.	For modification
and/or deletion of any of the conditions herein above, the applicants
will be at liberty to approach the concerned Court and such Court
shall decide the application for modification and/or deletion of any
of the conditions of this order in accordance with law.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_15">8.	At the trial, the
trial court shall not be influenced by the observations of
preliminary nature, qua the evidence at this stage, made by this
Court while enlarging the applicants on bail.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_16">9.	Rule made absolute
accordingly. Application is disposed of.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_17">10.	Direct service is
permitted.
