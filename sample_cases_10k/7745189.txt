                           but the brothers on a mutual understanding are
                           occupying the same as their own individual units;

                                     which the suit Property is situated is subject
                                     to partition among the Petitioner and
                                     Respondent No. 2 to 5 and they have given
                                     not given any clearance to the Petitioner to
                                     treat the Property in which the suit Property
                                     is situated as his own exclusive Property.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">E-277/13, 278/13, 279/13, 280/13 &amp; 281/13                                       Page 7 of 8</span>

                              iii.   Hence, it also becomes clear that the three
                                     properties as disclosed by the Respondent
                                     No. 1 are also available to the Petitioner.
