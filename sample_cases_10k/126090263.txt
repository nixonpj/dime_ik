       This petition is filed under Articles 226 and 227 of
the Constitution of India, praying to direct the I Addl. Sr.
Civil Judge, Bangalore Rural District, Bangalore to dispose
of the FDP No.2/2008, pending on its file within the time
limit of 3 months.


      This petition coming on for preliminary hearing this
day, the Court made the following:


                           ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      O.S.No.613/2005 filed by the petitioners against the

respondents in the Court of I Addl. Civil Judge (Sr. Dn.),

Bangalore   Rural   District,   Bangalore   was   allowed   on

07.12.2007. A preliminary decree having been passed, the

plaintiffs have filed FDP No.2/2008 to draw the final

decree. Defendants / respondents have filed statement of

objections, wherein it has been stated that a Misc. Petition

No.100/2008 filed to set aside the preliminary decree is

pending. Plaintiffs have filed an application under S.54 of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                               4</span>




CPC to appoint the Tahsildar, Bangalore South Taluk as

Commissioner to report the feasibility of the partition of

suit properties as per the preliminary decree, to which

respondents 1 &amp; 2 have filed statement of objections.


</p><p id="p_2">      2.    Trial Court by an order dated 16.04.2012,

taking into consideration the submission made on behalf of

respondents that an application filed for stay of operation

and execution of the decree passed in O.S.No.613/2005, in

Misc. Petition No.100/2008 is pending and even an

application for interim stay is also pending, has opined

that, "it is not proper to proceed with the final decree

proceedings unless and until said application is disposed of".

This writ petition has been filed to direct the Trial Court to

decide FDP No.2/2008 within three months' period and for

grant of consequential reliefs.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">      3.    Heard Sri N.J. Ramesh, learned advocate for

the petitioners and perused the writ petition record. In the

view which I intend to take in the matter, it is unnecessary

to issue notice to the respondents.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    5</span><p id="p_5">




</p><p id="p_6">      4.      Preliminary decree was passed in favour of the

petitioners    in O.S.No.613/2005 on 07.12.2007. Misc.

Petition No.100/2008 has been filed by the defendants to

set aside the said preliminary decree. Said Misc. Petition

was filed after FDP No.2/2008 was filed by the plaintiffs.

Mere filing of a miscellaneous case or an appeal cannot be

a ground to defer the consideration of the petition filed to

draw final decree. Though the misc. petition was filed in

the year 2008, there being no interim order passed till

16.04.2012,     the   Trial   Court    is   not    justified       in   not

proceeding with the FDP, merely on account of the

pendency of Misc. petition No.100/2008 and an application

filed therein to stay the preliminary decree passed on

07.12.2007. Learned Trial Judge ought to have proceeded

further for holding of an enquiry into the final decree

proceedings, since an application has been filed by the

plaintiffs    under   S.54    of   CPC      to    appoint      a    Court

Commissioner - Tahsildar to submit report with regard to

the feasibility of partition of suit properties.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                6</span>




</p><p id="p_7">       In the circumstances, unless there is any legal

impediment on account of any interim order passed in

Misc. Petition No.100/2008, the Trial Court is directed to

proceed with the enquiry of FDP No.2/2008.             If the

respondents do not produce any interim order staying the

operation of preliminary decree dated 07.12.2007 passed

in O.S.No.613/2005 and the further proceeding in FDP

No.2/2008 within a period of two months, the final decree

be drawn before 31.12.2013. Defence of the respondents

to FDP No.2/2008 is kept intact.

<p id="p_8">       Petition is disposed of accordingly.
