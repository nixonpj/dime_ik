                                2



      THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226 &amp;
227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, PRAYING TO QUASH THE
THAT PART OF THE ORDER DATED 21.9.2011 PASSED BY THE
1ST RESPONDENT VIDE ANNEXURE-D, IN SO FAR AS IT RELATES
TO ORDERING TO ENTERED THE NAME OF THE GOVERNMENT
IN THE REVENUE RECORDS OF THE LAND BEARING SY.NO.64,
NEW SY.NO.64/P64, MEASURING 02 ACRES 02 GUNTAS OF
BHUTANHALLI VILLAGE ETC.

    THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR 'PRELIMINARY
HEARING IN 'B' GROUP' THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE
FOLLOWING:

                            ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

learned HCGP.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.    Petitioner is before this Court praying for the

issuance of a writ of certiorari to quash a portion of the order

dated 21.09.2011 passed by respondent No.1 in case bearing

No.RRT(Ac)C.R./49/2009-10 vide Annexure-D to the petition

and whereby respondent No.1 has been pleased to direct that

the name of the Government be entered in the Revenue

Records. Further direction in the nature of mandamus is also

sought to the respondents to enter the name of the petitioner

in the Revenue Records in respect of the land bearing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3</span>



Sy.No.64 new Sy.No.64/P64 measuring 2 acres 2 guntas and

Sy.No.102 measuring 2 acres 4 guntas of Bhutanahalli

village, Jigani Hobli, Anekla Taluk, Bangalore District.


</p><p id="p_4">     3.    It is seen that the aforesaid lands were the subject

matter of the proceedings before the Assistant Commissioner,

initiated on an application by the petitioner under the

provisions of Section 5 of the PTCL Act. Therein one

Hanumakka was arrayed as respondent as she is the

purchaser of the land, which purchase is said to have been

prohibited under the term of the grant.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">     4.    Apparently, the application is to nullify the

conveyance said to have been made on 02.02.1965 and the

application is made in the year 2008. The application came to

be be partially allowed on 16.07.2011 and a direction came to

be issued to the jurisdictional Tahsildar to conduct an

enquiry and thereafter take action to re-grant the same to the

original grantee and take action in accordance with law.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               4</span>



</p><p id="p_7">     5.    It is submitted by the learned counsel for the

petitioner that the said order has become final and no appeal

has been preferred. Learned counsel for the petitioner would

also invite the attention of this Court to Annexure-D and

would contend that the petitioner is aggrieved by the direction

of respondent No.1 that the name of the Government be

entered in the Revenue Records.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">     6.    On perusal of Annexure-D, it is apparent that the

petitioner is not a party to the said proceedings and it is the

alleged purchaser who is arrayed as the respondent and the

appellant is the Tahsildar. On a closure scrutiny, it is seen

that there is no reference to the order of the Assistant

Commissioner. The said Hanumakka is also not a party

before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">     7.    Be that as it may, the petitioner is basing his

claims on the application said to have been adjudicated by

the Assistant Commissioner vide his order dated 16.07.2011.

He would submit that vide Annexure-E, he has made
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   5</span>



representation to the Tahsildar praying that action be

initiated    to   comply   with   the     order    of   the    Assistant

Commissioner.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">        8.   Learned   HCGP       would    submit       that   the   said

representation would be considered and disposed of in

accordance with law. Submission is placed on record.


</p><p id="p_14">        Accordingly, the petition is disposed of with a direction

to the respondents-Authorities to consider and dispose of

Annexure-E to the petition as expeditiously as possible.

Consideration and disposal shall be strictly in accordance

with law after issuing notice to the interested parties and the

same shall be within an outer limit of six months from the

date of receipt of a certified copy of this order.


</p><p id="p_15">        The petition stands ordered accordingly.
