<pre id="pre_1">             HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE C. PRAVEEN KUMAR

             CIVIL REVISION PETITION No.4830 OF 2018

ORDER:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This     Civil   Revision   Petition   is   filed   by    the

petitioners/plaintiffs, questioning the order dated 10.07.2018,

passed by the IV Additional Junior Civil Judge, Rajahmundry,

East Godavari District, in I.A.No.161 of 2018 in O.S.No.739 of

2011, wherein the application filed by the petitioners/plaintiffs,

under Order XI Rule 14 and Section 151 of C.P.C, seeking to

direct the defendants and D.W.1, to produce the will executed by

the father of the defendants in favour of the defendants, with

regard to the schedule property, was returned.

</p><p id="p_2">      Heard both sides.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      The case of the petitioners is that they are the plaintiffs in

the above said suit and it came to be filed for grant of permanent

injunction against the respondents-defendants from interfering

with the peaceful possession and enjoyment with regard to the

suit schedule property until the petitioners-plaintiffs are evicted

under due process of law. During the course of trial, D.W.1 in his

evidence stated that the father of the defendants executed a will

in favour of the defendants and it is under the custody of the

defendants and as such the impugned application came to be filed

to direct the respondents-defendants, to produce the same.

</p><p id="p_4">      A counter came to be filed by the respondents-defendants,

denying the averments made by the petitioners.        It is further

stated in the counter that the impugned application was filed only

with an intention to prolong the litigation. It is also stated that

previously the petitioners filed a memo seeking the very same

relief, i.e production of the alleged document under Order XII Rule
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2</span>


8 C.P.C. After hearing both parties, the Court below closed the

said memo observing that as the 2nd respondent-defendant and

D.W.1 J. Madhu Babu asserted that the alleged will is not in their

possession and custody, there cannot be any chance of producing

the same. Reiterating the submissions made in the impugned I.A,

it is pleaded that the defendants are not in possession of the

alleged document.     Basing on the averments in the impugned

application and averments in the counter, the court below

rejected the application. Challenging the same, the present civil

revision petition came to be filed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      As seen from the record, it is clear that though the plea of

the petitioners appears to be that the will is in the custody of the

defendants, no where, it is stated in the affidavit filed in support

of the I.A, that as to how the alleged will, will be helpful for the

purpose of deciding the injunction suit. Further, the suit is of the

year 2011 and when the matter was posted for arguments, the

present application came to be filed only with an intention to

delay the proceedings. Apart from that, the material placed on

record shows that a memo came to be filed with the very same

relief, which was rejected earlier. In the circumstances, I see no

reasons to interfere with the impugned order.

</p><p id="p_6">      Accordingly, the Civil Revision Petition is dismissed. There

shall be no order as to costs. Miscellaneous Petitions, if any

pending in this revision, shall stand closed.

</p><p id="p_7">                                                ________________________
