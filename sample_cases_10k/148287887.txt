<p id="p_1">1.     Heard learned advocates appearing for the respective
parties.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.     The present petition is directed against order of detention
dated 12.7.2019 passed by the respondent - detaining
authority in exercise of powers conferred under section 3(2) of
the Gujarat Prevention of Anti Social Activities Act, 1985 (for
short "the Act") by detaining the petitioner - detenue as
defined under section 2(b) of the Act.

of detention impugned in this petition deserves to be quashed
and set aside on the ground of registration of offences under
Sections 65(a)(e), 81, 116(b), etc. of the <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_1">Prohibition Act</a> by
itself cannot bring the case of the detenue within the purview
of definition under <a href="/doc/640985/" id="a_2">section 2(b)</a> of the Act.                  Further, learned
advocate for the detenue submits that illegal activity likely to
be carried out or alleged to have been carried out, as alleged,
cannot have any nexus or bearing with the maintenance of
public order and at the most, it can be said to be breach of law
and      order.         Further,   except         statement    of    witnesses,
registration of above FIR/s and Panchnama drawn in pursuance
of the investigation, no other relevant and cogent material is
on record connecting alleged anti-social activity of the detenue
with breach of public order.                  Learned advocate for the
petitioner further submits that it is not possible to hold on the
basis of the facts of the present case that activity of the
detenue with respect to the criminal cases had affected even
tempo of the society causing threat to the very existence of
normal and routine life of people at large or that on the basis
of criminal cases, the detenue had put the entire social
apparatus in disorder, making it difficult for whole system to
exist as a system governed by rule of law by disturbing public
order.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.    Learned AGP for the respondent State supported the
detention order passed by the authority and submitted that
sufficient material and evidence was found during the course
of investigation, which was also supplied to the detenue
indicate that detenue is in habit of indulging into the activity as
defined under <a href="/doc/640985/" id="a_3">section 2(b)</a> of the Act and considering the facts
of the case, the detaining authority has rightly passed the
order of detention and detention order deserves to be upheld

by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.   Having heard learned advocates for the parties and
considering the facts and circumstances of the case, it appears
that the subjective satisfaction arrived at by the detaining
authority cannot be said to be legal, valid and in accordance
with law, inasmuch as the offences alleged in the FIR/s cannot
have any baring on the public order as required under the Act
and other relevant penal laws are sufficient enough to take
care of the situation and that the allegations as have been
levelled against the detenue cannot be said to be germane for
the purpose of bringing the detenue within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/640985/" id="a_4">section 2(b)</a> of the Act. Unless and until, the material is there
to make out a case that the person has become a threat and
menace to the Society so as to disturb the whole tempo of the
society and that all social apparatus is in peril disturbing public
order at the instance of such person, it cannot be said that the
detenue is a person within the meaning of <a href="/doc/640985/" id="a_5">section 2(b)</a> of the
Act. Except general statements, there is no material on record
which shows that the detenue is acting in such a manner,
which is dangerous to the public order. In this connection, it
will be fruitful to refer to a decision of the Supreme Court in
Pushker Mukherjee v/s. State of West Bengal [AIR 1970
SC 852], where the distinction between 'law and order' and
'public order' has been clearly laid down. The Court observed
as follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "Does the expression "public order" take in every kind of
             infraction of order or only some categories thereof ? It is
             manifest that every act of assault or injury to specific
             persons does not lead to public disorder. When two
             people quarrel and fight and assault each other inside a
             house or in a street, it may be said that there is disorder
             but not public disorder. Such cases are dealt with under
             the powers vested in the executive authorities under the

       C/SCA/14999/2019                                      JUDGMENT



             provisions of ordinary criminal law but the culprits
             cannot be detained on the ground that they were
             disturbing public order. The contravention of any law
             always affects order but before it can be said to affect
             public order, it must affect the community or the public
             at large. In this connection we must draw a line of
             demarcation between serious and aggravated forms of
             disorder which directly affect the community or injure
             the public interest and the relatively minor breaches of
             peace of a purely local significance which primarily
             injure specific individuals and only in a secondary sense
             public interest. A mere disturbance of law and order
             leading to disorder is thus not necessarily sufficient for
             action under the Preventive Detention Act but a
             disturbance which will affect public order comes within
             the scope of the Act."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_6">6.   In view of above, I am inclined to allow this petition,
because simplicitor registration of FIR/s by itself cannot have
any nexus with the breach of maintenance of public order and
the authority cannot have recourse under the Act and no other
relevant and cogent material exists for invoking power under
<a href="/doc/778758/" id="a_6">section 3(2)</a> of the Act. In the result, the present petition is
hereby allowed and the impugned order of detention No.
PCB/DTN/PASA/772/2019         dated       12.7.2019    passed         by      the
respondent - detaining authority is hereby quashed and set
aside. The detenue is ordered to be set at liberty forthwith if
not required in any other case.
