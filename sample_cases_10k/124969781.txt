<pre id="pre_1">  HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE ABHINAND KUMAR SHAVILI
                     W.P.No.1393 of 2014
ORDER
</pre>


<p id="p_1">   This Writ Petition is filed seeking the following relief:

    "To   issue any appropriate Writ, Order or direction
    more in the nature of Writ of Mandamus declaring
    the     proceedings   Rc.No.A1/8061/2013,      dated
    11-01-2014 issued by Respondent No.4 and the
    procedure adopted for causing enquiry against the
    petitioner with regard to allegations alleged to have
    been made by the respondent No.6 and directing
    the petitioner to appear before him on 24-01-2014 at
    4-00 PM in the office of Executive Officer Sri
    Bhramaraba        Mallikarjuna     Swamy       Varla
    Devasthanam, Srisailam along with relevant records
    and in default the enquiry will be proceeded with
    basing on the records as unknown to rule of law and
    violative of Articles 14 and 16 of Constitution of
    India apart from violation of principles of natural
    justice and also contrary to the procedure envisaged
    for conducting enquiry against the employees who
    covered by the AP Charitable and Hindu Religious
    Institutions and Endowments Office Holders and
    Servants Rules, 2000 vide G.O.Ms.No.888 Revenue
    (Endowments-I) Department, dated 08-12-2000 and
    the provisions of A.P Charitable and Hindu
    Religious Institutions and <a href="/doc/377820/" id="a_1">Endowments Act</a>, 1987
    and also well settled principles of law laid down
    with regard to initiation of disciplinary proceedings
    against the delinquent employee and set aside the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 2</span>




       same and pass such further or other orders as the
       Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the
       circumstances of the case."
</p>
<p id="p_2">      Heard learned counsel on either side.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      It is the case of the petitioner that he is working as Upa

Pradhana Archaka in the 5th respondent-institution. While so,

the Sarpanch of the 6th respondent Gram Panchayat had made

certain allegations against him. Hence, the 4th respondent had

issued proceedings dated 11.01.2014 directing the petitioner to

appear for the enquiry scheduled to be held on 24.01.2014 at

4.00 P.M, along with records, and if he fails to appear, the

enquiry would be conducted ex parte. Challenging the said

proceedings, the present writ petition is filed.

</p><p id="p_4">      While ordering notice before admission, this Court

granted interim stay on 28.01.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits

that the action of the 4th respondent in directing the petitioner

to attend the enquiry scheduled to be held on 24.01.2014

without issuing any charge memo is arbitrary, and contrary to

the Service Regulations and          <a href="/doc/377820/" id="a_2">Endowments Act</a>. Learned

counsel further submits that if the 4th respondent had put the

petitioner on notice in the form of charge memo, then he

would have had an opportunity to submit his explanation.

But, without issuing any charge memo, the 4th respondent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 3</span>




issued the impugned proceedings. Hence, the impugned

proceedings are liable to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     Learned Government Pleader as well as learned

Standing Counsel appearing for the respondents contend that

the 6th respondent has levelled certain allegations against the

petitioner, and in order to enquire into the said allegations

only, the 4th respondent had directed the petitioner to attend

the enquiry vide impugned proceedings dated 11.01.2014 and

there are no merits in the writ petition and the same is liable

to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     Having considered the rival submissions made by the

learned counsel on either side, this Court is of the view that

without issuing any charge memo, the 4th respondent cannot

direct the petitioner to attend the enquiry scheduled to be held

on 24.01.2014. The impugned proceedings are contrary to the

Service Regulations. Hence, the same are liable to be set

aside.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     Accordingly, the Writ Petition is allowed and the

impugned proceedings dated 11.01.2014 are set aside.

However, the respondents are at liberty to initiate enquiry

against the petitioner, if they intend to do so, after following

the Service Regulations and take appropriate action. No costs.

closed.
