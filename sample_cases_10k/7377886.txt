</p><p id="p_3">                            2.According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the

                      petitioner, after obtaining electricity service connection in S.C. No.02-

                      414-003-512 for running ice cream parlour, has been paying electricity

                      service charges without any arrears till date. Learned counsel

                      appearing for the petitioner would submit that one Selvam, who is the

                      petitioner's   brother,   has   owned   land   and   agricultural   service

                      connection in S.C. No.101, executed a Gift Deed in favour of

                      petitioner's son, before his expiry. While so, on 13.02.2018, the

                      respondent came to petitioner's son's land and insisted him to pay

                      Rs.45,204/- and received Rs.10,000/- as part amount of the penalty

                      stating that his son misusing the agricultural service connection by

                      drawing the water to his manufacturing cooking coal unit. When the

                      said building situated one kilometer away from the said land and the

                      petitioner's son never used the said land for any commercial purpose

                      and no water is required for running the said business, the respondent

                      disconnected the service connection in S.C. No.512 without giving any

                      notice whatsoever, which is illegal and arbitrary.



</p><p id="p_4">                            3.Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would further

                      submit that if a mistake committed by the petitioner's son in S.C.

                      No.101, it is always open to the respondent to disconnect the service

                      connection. When the petitioner has been paying the electricity service

                      charges without any arrears, the respondents cannot proceed against

                      the petitioner in S.C. No.512. Therefore, the learned counsel for the

                      petitioner prays for the above direction.



</p><p id="p_5">                            4.By filing a counter affidavit, the learned Standing Counsel

                      appearing for the respondent would submit that the petitioner has

                      been using the agricultural service connection No.101, which stands in

                      his brother's name, who died long back. However, the petitioner has

                      misused the agricultural service connection for commercial purpose

                      and the same was found on 13.02.2018 and to avoid the prosecution,

                      the petitioner has paid Rs.1,000/- as compounding fee on the same

                      day. Thereafter, a Provisional Assessment Order dated 13.02.2018

                      under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_2">Section 135</a>/<a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_3">138</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003 was issued to the

                      petitioner calling upon him to file objection, if any. Since no objection

                      was received from him, the same was confirmed and the petitioner

                      was directed to pay a sum of Rs.45,204/-. As the petitioner has paid a

                      sum of Rs.10,000/-, the balance amount of Rs.35,204/- remains

                      un-paid to the Electricity Board.

</p><p id="p_7">                              5.Learned Standing Counsel would further submit that as per the

                      provision of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_4">Electricity Act</a> and Regulation, the said amount was

                      added to the account of his another electricity service No.512

                      pertaining to the month of April 2018. However, the petitioner has paid

                      only CC charges pertaining to S.C. No.512, but failed to pay the

                      arrears amount and therefore, the S.C. No.512 was disconnected on

                      29.06.2018 for non-payment of the amount.



</p><p id="p_8">                              6.In this regard, learned Standing Counsel, referring to Rule

                      17(8)    of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Supply Code, would submit that

                      where any consumer has more than one service connection, if he

                      defaults in the payment of dues relating to any one of the service

                      connections, the licensee may cause other service connections in the

                      name of the consumer to be disconnected on issuing proper notice till

                      all the arrears due for all the service connections are paid. In the

                      present case, as the petitioner has been enjoying the service

                      connection in S.C. No.101 after the death of his brother, he is bound

                      to pay the said amount.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">                              7.At the outset, it is relevant to extract Rule 17(8) of the Tamil

                      Nadu Electricity Supply code, which is quoted below:




http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                         5</span>

                           'Where    any   consumer    has   more   than   one   service
                           connection, if he defaults, in the payment of dues relating
                           to any one of the service connections, the licensee may
                           cause other service connections in the name of the
                           consumer to be disconnected on issuing proper notice till
                           all the arrears due for all the service connections are paid,
                           notwithstanding the fact that the service connections are
                           covered under separate agreements.'



</p><p id="p_11">                           8.A perusal of the above clearly shows that where any consumer

                      has more than one service connection in his name and if he defaults in

                      the payment of dues relating to any one of the service connections,

                      then the licensee may cause disconnection to any of the service

                      connection. But, in the present case, the petitioner is not having more

                      than one service connection.

</p><p id="p_13">                           9.When it is the case of the respondent that the petitioner has

                      misused the agricultural service connection for commercial purpose in

                      S.C. No.101 and the same was detected by them on 13.02.2018, they

                      ought not to have disconnected the service connection in S.C. No.512.

                      As the two service connections viz. S.C. Nos.101 and 512 are standing

                      in the name of two individuals, Clause 17(8) of the Tamil Nadu

                      Electricity Supply Code cannot be pressed into service. Accordingly,
