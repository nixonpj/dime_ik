<p id="p_6">                 5.                   Petitioner made a prayer that enquiry under

                 also appears from the record that the said petition was replied

                 by the defendants where the plea was taken that application

                 filed. did not bear the signature of defendant nos. 3 to 8 as

                 the said application was filed by the advocate clerk late Jhari

                 Lal Singh who had also obtained signature of advocate

                 concerned. It has further been stated that late Nirmala Devi

                 had already transferred the land and as such her heirs and

                 successors had no interest over the land and the application

                 was filed with a view to unnecessary harass the defendants

                 and made a prayer for rejection of the application. Further, an

                 application was filed making a prayer that newly added heirs

                 and successors be deleted as their deletion would not cause

                 any harm or benefit to defendants nos. 3 to 8. The court

                 below refused to initiate a proceeding under <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_5">section 195</a> read

                 with <a href="/doc/908644/" id="a_6">section 340</a> of the Code and the same was approved by

                 the appellate court which is under challenge.

                 rejoinder was in two parts, first opposite party no.2 filed an

                 application with wrong name of husband of Nirmala Devi as

                 the name of husband of Nirmala Devi is Satyendra Prasad

                 Singh whereas he has given the name of her husband

                 Sachidanand Singh, second, signatures bearing in the petition

                 are forged and fabricated. He has submitted that the falsity is

                 in two parts, first part is falsity of statement, i.e. name in the

                 petition, and another documents bearing of forged and

                 fabricated signature claiming to be signature of heir and

                 successor of late Nirmala Devi. He has further submitted that

                 aforesaid actions will come under the mischief of <a href="/doc/14134/" id="a_7">Section

                 195(1)(b)(i)(ii)</a> of the code. He has submitted, though the

                 document was prepared outside the court but false statement

                 in pleading will be covered by <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_8">section 195</a> (1)(b) (i)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_9"> of the

                 Penal Code. He further submits that the case will also fall

                 within the mischief of <a href="/doc/1616180/" id="a_11">section 195(1)(b)(ii)</a> of the Code as

                 forgery has been committed with regard to the document as

                 signatures in the petition are forged and fabricated and used

                 the same for their benefit.

<p id="p_8">                 7.                              Learned counsel for opposite party

                 no.2 has submitted that all the action has been done outside

                 the court as the said document was prepared outside the court

                 and it will not be deemed in any way,           the opposite party

                 no.2 has interfered or statement made in the rejoinder was in

                 custodia legis. He has further submitted, the court will have

                 jurisdiction to lodge a case, if any forgery had been

                 committed after filing of rejoinder by opposite party no. 2

                 while under the custody of the court. It has further been

                 submitted that there is no dispute that late Nirmala Devi had

                 left her husband but the name of the husband was wrongly

                 given or typed as in place of Satyendra Singh, Sachidanand

                 Singh has been given.             It will not   make the situation

                 change, merely wrong name has been typed but the fact

                             by the respondents. The view taken by the
                             learned Additional Sessions judge and the
                             High Court is perfectly correct and calls for
                             no interference."

<p id="p_18">                 17.        In this view of the matter case reported in Iqbal

                 Singh Marwah (supra) will equally be applicable in <a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_46">section

                 195(1)(b)(i)</a>. Another judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme

                 Court has also considered this aspect of the matter in the case

                 of Rugmini Ammal (supra) where the similar matter came up

                 for consideration before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court and the

                 court has followed the judgment of Iqbal Singh Marwah

                 (supra). In paragraph 6 of the judgment the Hon‟ble Supreme

                 Court has held as follows:

                         Court was that proceedings under <a href="/doc/908644/" id="a_47">Section 340</a> of

                         allegation that the fabrication was made after the
                         document was produced. Certain other stands were
                         also taken with which we are not very much
                         concerned."

<p id="p_19">                 18.          At the same time the court has also held that before

                 filing the complaint the court may held a preliminary enquiry

                 and record the finding that it is expedient in the interest of

                 justice that an enquiry should be made into any offences

                 referred to <a href="/doc/14134/" id="a_49">Section 195(1)(b)</a>. This expediency will normally

                 be judged by the court by weighing not the magnitude of

                 injury suffered by the person affected by such forgery or

                 forged document, but having regard to the effect or impact,

                 such commission of offence has upon administration of

                 justice. It is possible that such forged document or forgery

                 may cause a very serious or substantial injury to a person in

                 the sense that it may deprive him of a very valuable property

                 or status or the like, but such document may be just a piece of

                 evidence produced or given in evidence in court where

                 voluminous evidence may have been adduced and the effect

                 of such piece of evidence on the broad concept of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25"> Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.476 of 2011 (4) dt.01-11-2012</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                           14</span>




                 administration of justice may be minimal. In such

                 circumstances, the court may not consider it expedient in the

                 interest of justice to make a complaint. The broad view of as

                 canvassed by learned counsel for the appellants, would

                 render the victim of such forgery or forged document

                 remediless. Any interpretation which leads to a situation

                 where a victim of a crime is rendered remediless, has to be

                 discarded.

<p id="p_20">                 19.             In view of the aforesaid judgment of the Hon‟ble

                 Supreme Court, issue has to be tested, is the nature of

                 allegation that has been made in the complaint petition. Here

                 only allegation has been made in place of Satyendra Singh,

                 Sachidanand Singh has been typed. There is no allegation

                 that late nirmala Devi had not left any husband so factual

                 aspect of having a husband at the time of death is not denied

                 rather the only issue is with regard to giving wrong name of

                 her husband and signature of fictitious person. All the acts

                 that has been done outside the court and as such the present

                 case is completely covered by the case of Eqbal Singh

                 Marwah (supra)            and Rugmini Ammal (supra) and in this

                 view of the matter this Court does not find any merit in this

                 application.

                           can take appropriate step in accordance with law.
