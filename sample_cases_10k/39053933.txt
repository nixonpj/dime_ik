                   Dated this the 4th day of June, 2012.


                              JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1. Heard the learned senior counsel Sri.T.P.M.Ibrahim Khan for the

   petitioner and the learned senior counsel Sri.P.Santhalingam for the

   Board.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2. Petitioner is the Managing Director of an Information Technology

   industrial unit undertaking software development and medical

   transcription. The medical transcription is being undertaken by the

   petitioner's industrial unit on the basis of the requirement of their

   clients abroad. On the basis of the approval of the Ministry of

   Industries and I.T.Department, the petitioner unit was granted

   electric connection under LT-IV category.        Petitioner has taken

   electric connection to run the equipments and computers in it's unit.

   The second respondent has issued an invoice demanding a a huge

   amount which is three times of the usual bill amount on the ground

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C)No.16455/2007              -:2:-</span>



that the petitioner has included medical transcription, which is not an

information technology business. It is submitted on behalf of the

KSEB that, on 7.5.2007, the Sub Engineer from the office of the

second respondent along with Regional Audit Officer, KSEB,

Ernakulam had inspected the premises of the petitioner and prepared

a mahazar showing the number and nature of equipments and

computers used for the purpose of software development and

connected activities, including medical transcription. It is submitted

that where a consumer is carrying on different business activities

falling under different tariff classifications and power is utilized

from the same electric connection for all those activities, the entire

consumption will be assessed at the rate applicable to the activity

falling under the highest tariff. The third respondent has filed a

counter affidavit wherein it is categorically stated in paragraph 11

that in Ext.R3(d) the petitioner had shown that the medical

transcription is being undertaken by them on the basis of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C)No.16455/2007               -:3:-</span>



software development based on the requirement of their clients

abroad. However, the activities of developing the software are the

mainstream and the medical transcription is only a subsidiary activity

of the said mainstream which is part of the development of the

software. The said activity cannot be segregated and divided in the

process of information technology development.        Ultimately, the

equipments and computers which are used for the purpose of

software development are the same for the purpose of           medical

transcription. So there is no change in the use of electricity or

equipments for the purpose medical transcription also. In paragraph

13 of the counter affidavit it is specifically stated that the firm is

engaged in the activity of software development and medical

transcription. Both the activities are coming under the purview of

information technology and hence eligible for electricity connection

under LT-IV category. Therefore, in view of such statements in the

counter affidavit, the stand taken by the third respondent on the basis

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">   W.P.(C)No.16455/2007               -:4:-</span>



   of the audit report cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            In the result, this writ petition is allowed quashing the

   proceedings pursuant to Exts.P7 and P8. If any excess amount has

   been paid by the petitioner in pursuance to the refund order, the same

   shall be adjusted towards future bills.
