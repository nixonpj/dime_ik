                      M.Cr.C. No. 1398/2017
11.10.2017
              Shri Manoj Kumar Mishra, learned counsel for the
petitioner.
              Shri Yogesh Dhande, learned counsel for the State.

                            ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">              The petitioner has preferred this petition u/s. 482 of
the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1">Cr.P.C</a>. feeling aggrieved with order dated 22.12.2016 passed
by learned 3rd Additional Sessions Judge, Chhatarpur in Cr.
Revision No.209/2016 whereby the learned revisional Court has
declined to interfere with order dated 18.11.2016 passed by
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM), Chhatarpur in remand
case    Crime     No.437/2016,     Police   Station   City    Kotwali,
Chhatarpur.
</p><p id="p_2">2.            Relevant facts, briefly stated are as under :
</p><p id="p_3">       (i)    Vehicle (MAX jeep) bearing Rgistration No. MP-16-
D-0733 has been seized by the police, City Kotwali, Chhatarpur
on 21.10.2016 on the basis of allegation that the same was being
used for illicit transportation of liquor. In this regard, Crime
No.437/2016 u/s. 34(2) of the M.P. Excise Act, 1915 (hereinafter,
for short, 'the Act') was registered at Police Station, City Kotwali,
Chhatarpur.
</p><p id="p_4">3.            The petitioner claiming to be registered owner of the
vehicle prayed for release of the vehicle in his favour by moving
                                  2                      MCrC 1398/2017


an application u/s. 452 of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_2">Cr.P.C</a>. Before learned CJM,
Chhatarpur. The learned CJM by order dated 18.11.2016 rejected
the application observing that Collector, Chhatarpur has initiated
confiscation proceedings with regard to the vehicle, therefore, in
view of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3">Section 47-A(3)(a)</a> of 'the Act', the vehicle cannot be
released.
</p><p id="p_5">4.          Being aggrieved, the petitioner preferred a revision
against the order of the CJM before 3 rd Additional Sessions
Judge, Chhatarpur, but the same was dismissed by the learned
revisional Court vide the impugned order and the order passed by
the learned CJM was affirmed.
</p><p id="p_6">5.          The impugned order is challenged before this Court
on the ground that no notice as contemplated u/s. 47-A(3)(b) of
'the Act' has so far been received by the petitioner with regard to
initiation of confiscation proceedings and that the Collector has
also not intimated that he is going to initiate the confiscation
proceedings and that the confiscation proceedings, as such, have
not been initiated, therefore, the bar of jurisdiction of Court
contemplated u/s. 47-D of 'the Act' is not attracted.
</p><p id="p_7">6.          Per contra, it is submitted by the learned counsel for
the State that the confiscation proceedings have already been
initiated by the Collector and formal intimation in this regard has
already been sent to the concerned Magistrate, therefore, the bar
enacted u/s. 47-D of 'the Act' with regard to making of orders in
respect of disposal or custody of the property is very much
                                   3                   MCrC 1398/2017


attracted, hence it cannot be said that the learned CJM has
committed any illegality in refusing to release the vehicle on
'Supurdigi' or that the learned revisional Court has committed any
error in upholding the order passed by the learned CJM.
7             Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused
the record.
</p><p id="p_8">8.            <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">Section 47-D</a> of 'the Act', which enacts bar with
regard to jurisdiction of the Court and it is apposite for the
present purpose, runs as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "47-D. Bar of jurisdiction of the Court
              under       certain      circumstances       -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
              contained in the Act, or any other law for the
              time being in force, the Court having
              jurisdiction to try offences covered by clause
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">              (a) or (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 34 on
              account of which such seizure has been
              made, shall not make any order about the
              disposal, custody etc. of the intoxicants,
              articles, implements, utensils, materials,
              conveyance etc. seized after it has received
              from the Collector an intimated under clause
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">              (a) of sub-section (3) of Section 47-A about
              the initiation of the proceedings for
              confiscation of seized property."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">9.            <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Section 47-A</a>,(3)(b) of 'the Act' further requires that a
notice shall be issued in writing to the person from whom
articles, etc. has been seized and to any person staking claim to it.
</p><p id="p_10">10.           Though, the learned counsel for the petitioner relying
on a decision dated 22.8.2017 of this Court rendered in Salim vs.
                                           4                 MCrC 1398/2017


         State, M.Cr.C. No.5561/2017 (Principal Seat, Jabalpur), has
         contended that in absence of any notice issued to the petitioner,
         the vehicle ought to have been released in favour of the
         petitioner, however, considering the fact that no such requirement
         is contemplated by <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Section 47-D</a> of 'the Act', the contention
         cannot be accepted.
</p><p id="p_11">         11.         It has clearly come in Para 6 of the impugned order
         that Collector, Chhatarpur vide his communication dated
         9.11.2016 has informed CJM, Chhatarpur about initiation of
         confiscation proceedings of the vehicle for its alleged
         involvement in illicit trafficking of liquo. Considering this, it
         cannot be said that the learned CJM or for that matter, the learned
         revisional Court has committed any error in declining to release
         the vehicle in favour of the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_12">         13.         Accordingly, this petition having no merit deserves to
         be and is hereby dismissed.
