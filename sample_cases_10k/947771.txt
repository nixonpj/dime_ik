                                  DECIDED ON : 20.01.2009

Vijay Kumar and others
                                             ...Petitioners

Ishri Devi and others
                                             ...Respondents


CORAM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K. KANNAN


Present : Mr. M. L. Sarin, Senior Advocate with
          Ms. Himani Sarin, Advocate and
          Ms. Alka Sarin, Advocate,
          for the petitioners.

             Mr. Arun Jain, Senior Advocate with
             Mr. Amit Jain, Advocate,
             for the respondents


K. KANNAN, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">I. Scope :
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.           The tenant, who had been ordered to be evicted by the

Rent Controller and the Appellate Authority, assails the findings

of the authorities below that have maintained the order of

eviction on the grounds of different user and subletting of the

premises.
</p>
<p id="p_3">II. The rival contentions :
</p>
<p id="p_4">2.           The landlord's contention as regards the different user

was that the property had been let out only for a non-residential

purpose for running a laundry shop but the tenant had allowed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> C.R. NO. 3297 of 2003                              -2-</span>



the property to be used also for a residential purpose by letting

his son to carry on his living along with his wife and children. The

ground floor of the shop bearing No. 42 Sector - 28/C,

Chandigarh had given on rent for Rs.490/- per month and that

the second respondent had been using the back portion of the

shop for the purpose of denting, painting and welding of motor

cars. This constituted not merely a change of user but an act of

subletting that entitled the landlord to obtain eviction.

</p><p id="p_5">3.         The tenant had not specifically denied the averment in

the petition regarding occupation of some of the petitioners for

residential purpose but denied the plea of subletting urged by the

landlord. His contention was that he had no concern with the

second respondent and that he had taken the premises for

running a business but not for any specific trade. According to

him, the first respondent himself did not remain in exclusive

possession of the courtyard, but he mainly used only the

bathroom and latrine occasionally. The courtyard was, according

to him, used only by the petitioner and he never objected to

"sitting of respondent No.2 by the petitioner".(sic)

III. The raison d'tre for eviction

</p><p id="p_6">4.         The Rent Controller and the Appellate Court found, on

an elaborate consideration of oral and documentary evidence,

that the son Vijay Kumar had actually been using the property for

his residential purpose. The case had been filed on 16.08.1993

and an Advocate Commissioner had also been appointed to note
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> C.R. NO. 3297 of 2003                             -3-</span>



down the physical features of the property. The Commissioner

had filed a report stating that the son had been using a cot at the

back portion of the shop and was living with his wife. The Rent

Controller, as well as, the Appellate Court found the contention of

the landlord regarding the residential use of the son by the fact

that apart from their oral evidence of an adjacent shop owner,

who spoke about the continued living of the son at the premises,

the copy of ration card had also been produced through a

revenue official who had been summoned to produce the

documents which contained reference to Vijay Kumar and other

family members as being residents of the petition mentioned

premises. The Courts below also found that the tenant had sublet

the premises and had let out the courtyard to another person. It

transpired that the second respondent had vacated the premises

subsequent to the filing of the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_7">IV. Basis of challenge for different user"
</p>
<p id="p_8">5.          The decisions of the Rent Controller and the Appellate

Authority are impugned by the learned Senior counsel for the

revision-petitioner, as regards the different user, on the following

grounds :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            a)   An Advocate Commissioner's report could not

            have been relied to find out the possession of his son;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            b)   the original ration card had not been produced

            and a copy of it produced by an official, which though

            marked but not exhibited, could not be relied on;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> C.R. NO. 3297 of 2003                            -4-</span>



</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">          c)    The predominant purpose of the building for a

          non-residential purpose had not been lost by merely

          allowing his son to use a portion of the premises for a

          residential purpose.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">V. Basis of challenge against subletting :
</p>
<p id="p_10">6.         As regards the contention of subletting, the contention

was that the alleged sub-tenant had himself vacated the

premises admittedly, subsequent to the filing of the petition and

therefore, the ground of eviction did not subsist. Even if the

possession as on the date of filing of the petitioner alone was to

be taken, even then the possession of the second respondent was

not attributable to him but the landlord himself had allowed the

second respondent to be in possession of the property. The

second respondent, according to him, was not his sub-tenant but

a direct tenant of the landlord himself.
</p>
<p id="p_11">VI. Commissioner cannot 'find ' possession :
</p>
<p id="p_12">7.         I have no hesitation in rejecting the documentary

value of the Commissioner's report, in so far as it makes a

reference in the report that the first respondent's son was found

in possession of back portion of the shop. An Advocate

Commissioner appointed by the Court could at best assist the

Court by his ministerial acts in gathering evidence relating to the

physical features and the issue of who is in possession could

never be delegated by a direction for a finding through an

Advocate Commissioner. The finding of possession is invariably a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> C.R. NO. 3297 of 2003                             -5-</span>



judicial act to be undertaken by a Court or a Rent Controller and

such a power cannot be abdicated to an Advocate Commissioner.

I eschew the report in reference to the Commissioner's report or

his evidence regarding possession.
</p>
<p id="p_13">VII. Consideration regarding issue of different user

</p><p id="p_14">8.         The Courts below have      considered the fact that the

landlord had specifically adverted to the fact that the        first

respondent's son Vijay Kumar has been in possession of the back

portion of the shop in the petition in the following words :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">           "Vijay Kumar son of respondent No.1 has also started

           living in the back room, behind the shop".</blockquote><p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">           There was also a direct evidence of PW-1 relating to

the very same averment. The respondent has not controverted

the averment in the written statement, nor has he utilized the

occasion of the cross examination of PW-1, to elicit that he was

not living there but was using the portion temporarily. The

counsel for the revision petitioner sought to further explain the

inadequacy of the pleadings regarding want of denial, by stating

that there was definite statement in evidence that his son was

living in another sector in Chandigarh in a rented premises along

with his wife and in view of such evidence, he shall be deemed to

have refuted the landlord's contention regarding the change of

user of the portion of the tenanted premises for the residential

purpose of the tenant's son. This contention does not appear to

be correct and a definite finding of the fact referred by the Courts
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> C.R. NO. 3297 of 2003                             -6-</span>



below taking into account the nature of the pleadings and the

definite evidence, I am not inclined to interfere with the findings

that the first respondent's son Vijay Kumar was not occupying

the portion of the building for residential purpose.

</p><p id="p_17">9.         The learned Senior counsel for the revision petitioner

would still contend that even if the son of the tenant is found to

be in occupation of the portion of the premises, it cannot qualify

for an actionable change of user, so long as the change of user

had not caused any prejudice to the landlord. According to him

there had been written document of lease and there was

consequently no stipulation regarding the mode of user. He relies

also on the decision of this Court and the Supreme Court which

have held that the basic idea of Clause-(b) of Section 13(2)(i) of

the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act is          that the tenant

should not be allowed to use the property for the purpose for

which the landlord may not have agreed. He also stated that the

issue whether the landlord and tenant agreed to the purpose for

which the building has to be used must be considered in the

context of expressions used in the lease deed. In "Telu Ram vs.

Om Parkash Garg" 1971 PLR (1),            a Division Bench of this

Court held while considering the affect of Section 13 (2)(ii)(b) of

the Act that "change of use of building made in small part of the

building would not automatically render the tenant to be ejected

under this Clause". The Bench interpreted the expression used in

13 (2)(ii) of the Act, while referring to the issue of subletting or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> C.R. NO. 3297 of 2003                             -7-</span>



transfer of the "building" but had not used the expression "entire

building". Consequently, a conversion of a small portion of the

building would not attract the scope of the Section to result in

eviction. A similar reasoning was adopted in "<a href="/doc/291509/" id="a_1">Mohinder Kaur

vs. Baldev Singh</a>" 1999 (2) All India Rent Control Journal

593 that "if a property was taken for a residential purpose, still it

has to be seen whether the dominant purpose remains the same

or not". The letting of building for residential purpose but if the

tenant had allowed a portion of the building for non-residential

purpose by installing a hand loom in a room, the Court said that

using of a small portion for the purpose different from the

purpose of letting, does not amount to change of user. Similar is

the position in case "<a href="/doc/1578758/" id="a_2">Dharam Chand vs. Mathura Dass</a>" 1982

AIR 224 that "use of a small portion of shop for a residential

purpose would not amount to change of user". The Supreme

Court in "Atul Castings Ltd. Vs. Bawa Gurvachan Singh"

(2001) 5 Supreme Court Cases 133 held that "property let for

residential purpose could not be said to have been used for non-

residential purpose to be susceptible for ejectment for a tenant

who used one room as an office for disposal of official work at

home". There, the Supreme Court said, by reasoning that if there

was no regular commercial activity or business carried on

including interaction with the public and customers etc., the

change of user could not be attributed to the tenant under the

East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> C.R. NO. 3297 of 2003                               -8-</span><p id="p_18">



</p><p id="p_19">10.         The conspectus of all the rulings seem to clearly dis-

favour an action of eviction merely on the ground that a portion

of the building used for any purpose by either the tenant or any

one from the family members of his family, so long there was no

prejudice caused to the landlord. While declining to interfere with

the findings of the fact regarding the user of the son of back

portion of the shop for residential purpose, I find that the user of

the property is not such as to cause any prejudice to the landlord

and does not enable him to secure an eviction on the said

ground. I agree with the contention of the revision-petitioner that

the property which is used by the son for taking rest by having a

cot etc. at the back portion of the shop does not amount to

actionable change of user by the tenant.
</p>
<p id="p_20">VIII. Issue of subletting- finding one of fact:

</p><p id="p_21">11.         The    contention   that   now   requires      attention   is

regarding    the   alleged   sub-tenancy     in   favour    of   second

respondent. The contention of the revision-petitioner is that the

courtyard itself is not a part of the demised premises and the

occupation by the second respondent cannot be a subject of

complaint. The legal submission is that there cannot be sub-

tenancy so long as the tenant had not lost exclusive possession

of the property to a sub-tenant. The counsel relied on decision of

the Supreme Court in "Smt. Krishnawanti vs. Hans Raj"

1975 S.C 165 that "when landlord sought eviction on the ground

of subletting, it is a settled law that the onus to prove subletting
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> C.R. NO. 3297 of 2003                             -9-</span>



was on the landlord and if the landlord prima facie shows that the

occupant was in exclusive possession of the premises let-out, it

would be then for the tenant to rebut that evidence". <a href="/doc/869439/" id="a_3">In "M/S

Shalimar Tar Products Ltd. vs. H. C. Sharma and others</a>"

(1988) 1 Supreme Court Cases 70, the Supreme Court said

that "to constitute subletting, there must be parting of the legal

possession i.e possession with the right to include and also the

right to exclude others". The Supreme Court also said that the

issue, if such parting had taken place, whether there was any

subletting and if so, was the same with the consent in writing of

the landlord etc., are essentially questions of fact". In "Dev Dutt

Verma vs. Ajit Singh and others" 1965 Cur.L.J 341 this

Court had held that "the burden which was cast on the landlord

to show that there had been subletting, would not be discharged

by merely showing some third party using the part of the

premises". It has also been stated that "even a false plea by a

tenant cannot fill up the lacuna in the evidence for proving the

issue regarding subletting, the burden of which was heavily on

the landlord. In yet another judgment in "<a href="/doc/803434/" id="a_4">Ram Dhan Sharma

vs. Bishan Sarup Mittal</a>" 1994 (1) RCR            462 that "even a

wrong defence taken up by the tenant in a case of subletting

does not absolve the landlord from proving his case, as the onus

lies on the landlord to prove the case of subletting".

</p><p id="p_22">12.        The last two decisions of this Court while laying down

that the burden to prove is always upon the tenant, was on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> C.R. NO. 3297 of 2003                             -10-</span>



consideration of instances where the exclusivity of possession of

another party other than the tenant was itself a contentious

issue. In this case the fact that the second respondent is in

possession, is admitted. It is further admitted in evidence of the

tenant that the back portion of the courtyard had been allowed to

be in his exclusive possession by the landlord. In the evidence of

RW-1, it is stated by maintaining that "the disputed premises

consisting of shop, back one room and latrine and bathroom and

courtyard are in my possession. The courtyard, latrine and

bathroom are joint". If the possession had been with him at the

time of letting and if it is shown subsequently and that the

second respondent was in possession, it would be most artificial

to contend that he had ceded possession to the second

respondent at the mere wish of the landlord subsequently.

Finding this admission inconvenient, the learned Senior counsel

sought to contend that this evidence was wrongly recorded and in

the   context   in   which   the   evidence   comes   in   the   cross

examination, a suggestion has been wrongly recorded as though

admitted when his witness must have denied the suggestion.

According to him whole of the evidence is to be read, this single

admission seems incongruous. I have read through the evidence

and the admission seems categoric and not any mistake in

recording of the evidence. Even if there had been a mistake, it

ought to have been pointed out before the Rent Controller

himself and the correct recording must have been made by an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> C.R. NO. 3297 of 2003                                -11-</span>



application for review and it cannot be urged in the revision

petition for the first time and what is must, even taking it as a

ground of revision that the evidence has been recorded wrongly.

</p><p id="p_23">13.         The plea of subletting had been found by both the

Rent Controller and the Appellate Authority as having been

established by reference to the oral evidence adduced by the

landlord,   the   evidence   of   adjoining   shop   owner   and   the

admissions of the tenant. This aspect is essentially a pure

question of fact and the findings have been rendered on proper

appreciation of evidence. There is no illegality in the matter in

appreciation of the evidence and there would be no warrant for

interference in the finding of eviction on the ground of subletting.

IX. Conclusion :
</p>
<p id="p_24">14.         Under the circumstances, the order of eviction is

maintained on the ground of subletting alone and the revision

petition is dismissed. There shall, however, be no order as to

costs.
</p>
<p id="p_25">15.         At the time of passing of the orders, learned counsel

for the revision petitioner states that he has been running the

business for the last many years and he seeks time to vacate the

same. Two month's time is granted to vacate the premises.
