                               JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Connected Writ Petitions are filed challenging the orders of the

Co-operative Tribunal partly confirming the awards passed by the

arbitrator against the petitioner and partly modifying the awards. I

have heard counsel appearing for the petitioners and separate standing

counsel appearing for respondents 1 and 2. Petitioners' grievance is

that loan sanctioned by the first respondent was not released in terms of

the schedule or at the ratio promised. Consequently there was delay in

completion of the project and they have suffered loss. However, it is

seen that above Rs. 7 lakhs was sanctioned for the hotel project of the

petitioner, which was worth Rs. 13.2 lakhs.               Even though first

instalment released namely 2.83 lakhs itself is below the promised

limit, petitioner accepted the amount and it is alleged that further

instalments given were also not upto the agreed levels. I find that the

total loan amount released is Rs. 6.07 lakhs out of the sanctioned

amount of Rs. 7 lakhs. By accepting first instalment, I feel, petitioner

has allowed modification of the terms of the contract and so much so,

petitioner cannot complain against violation of the agreement after the

project is completed. Further on the whole, respondents have honoured

their commitment because around more than 40% of the project cost is

funded by them through loans.          Therefore petitioner's claim for

compensation is not tenable and the arbitrator rightly rejected it it and

Tribunal confirmed it. It is seen that Tribunal has cancelled the award

pertaining to demand of interest which is 2% above the contract rate.

Besides this 1% commitment charges is also cancelled.          The balance

award amount pertains to debt amount with contract rate of interest. I

do not think there is any justification for this Court to interfere with the

award. However, for settlement of liability, petitioner is given freedom

to approach respondents under OTS scheme, if any, pending.
