ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

 
 


 

<p id="p_1">1.	By
filing present petition the petitioner - detenu under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article
226</a>  of the Constitution of India, the petitioner has prayed to quash
and set aside the order of detention dated 11th August,
2011 passed by the respondent No.2 - Police Commissioner,
Ahmedabad, in exercise of power under sub-section (2) of Section 3 of
the Gujarat Prevention of Anti Social Activities Act, 1985 (for short
"PASA Act"). The detenue is  branded as  "bootlegger".
</p>

 

 


 

<p id="p_2">2.	Heard
the learned Advocate for the petitioner and learned AGP for the
respondents. No Affidavit in reply is filed by the respondents
controverting the averments made by the petitioner.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_3">3.	The
petitioner came to be detained as "bootlegger" on his
involvement in the offence being  Prohibition CR (i) No. 5243 of
2009, (ii) No. 5063 of 2011, and (iii) No. 5196 of 2011, all
registered with Kagdapith Police Station, Ahmedabad. 
</p>
 

	
 

<p id="p_4">4.	It
has been submitted by the learned Counsel for the petitioner that it
is a settled legal position that on registration of offence, no order
of detention could have been passed as petitioner - detenu
cannot be branded as "bootlegger". It has been further
submitted that the activities of the petitioner cannot be said to be
injurious to the public health or public order. It has been further
submitted by the learned Counsel for the petitioner that there is
gross delay in passing the order of detention as well as there is
gross delay in executing the order of detention. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_5">5.	I
have gone through the grounds of detention and considered the
arguments advanced by the learned Counsel for the petitioner as well
as the learned A.G.P.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_6">6.	The
Court is of the opinion that there is much substance in the arguments
advanced by learned Counsel for the petitioner. It is seen from the
grounds that a general statement has been made by the detaining
authority that consuming liquor is injurious to health. In fact, a
perusal of the order passed by the detaining authority shows that the
grounds which are mentioned in the order are in reference to the
situation of "law and order" and not "public
order". Therefore, on this ground, the subjective satisfaction
of the detaining authority is vitiated on account of non-application
of mind and the impugned order, therefore, deserves to be quashed and
set aside. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_7">7.	Except
the general statement, there is no material on record which shows
that the petitioner - detenue is carrying out illegal
activities of selling liquor which is harmful to the health of the
public. In support of the above submission, learned Advocate for the
detenue has placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court
in the case of PIYUSH KANTILAL MEHTA v/s COMMISISONER OF POLICE,
reported in AIR 1989 SC 491 and the recent Judgment dated
28.3.2011 passed by the Division Bench of this Court (Coram : S.J.
Mukhopadhyay, CJ &amp; J.B. Pardiwala, J.) in Letters Patent
Appeal No. 2732 of 2010 in Special Civil Application No.9492 of 2010
(Artiben v/s Commissioner of Police) which would squarely help the
detenue. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_8">8.	Applying
the ratio of the above decisions, it is clear that before passing an
order of detention, the detaining authority must come to a definite
findings that there is threat to the 'public order' and it is very
clear that the present case would not fall within the category of
threat to a public order. In that view of the matter, when the order
of detention has been passed by the detaining authority without
having adequate grounds for passing the said order, cannot be
sustained and, therefore, it deserves to be quashed and set aside.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_9">9.	In
the result, this petition is allowed. The impugned order of detention
dated 11th August, 2011 passed by the Police Commissioner,
Ahmedabad City, is hereby quashed and set aside. The detenu is
ordered to be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other
case. Rule is made absolute accordingly. Direct service permitted.
</p>
