5000/­ each  to complainant Bijender and Rs. 5000/­ each to injured namely 

Manvinder Singh.  It is also held by ld. Trial Court that all the sentences shall 

run concurrently.  
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">2.             Aggrieved by the judgment and order on sentence, the appellants 

have filed the present appeal on the ground that the ld. Trial Court has failed 

to appreciate the fact that there is a delay of four days in registering the FIR, 

which is fatal to the case of prosecution.  IO has not given any explanation as 

to why he had not recorded the statement of complainant Bijender on the same 

day of incident.  The statement of other eye witness Manvinder Singh was also 

not recorded on the same day.   Ld. Trial Court has failed to appreciate that 

complainant and injured were taken to the hospital by the PCR but MLCs on 

record reveal that the complainant and injured  were taken to hospital by IO 

ASI Ashok Kumar.   Ld. Trial Court has failed to appreciate that no date of 

recording statement u/s. 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a> is mentioned on the statement of injured 

Manvinder Singh.   PW­3 Manvinder Singh admitted   that his statement was 

recorded   in   Ortho   Plus   Hospital     and   according   to   IO   the   statement   of 

Manvinder Singh was recorded at his home. The ld. MM failed to consider 

this   major   contradiction.     It   is   also   mentioned   that   ld.   MM   has   failed   to 



CA No. 6/15.                                                                      Page No. 2/20
 consider the fact that according to PW­3 Manvinder Singh, he was caught 

hold by Neetu, Nirmala and Vinay gave beatings to him with wodden sticks 

but   according     to   PW­1   Bijender   Singh,     accused   Jitender   caught   hold 

Manvinder and accused Vinay gave beating to him  with wooden stick, which 

is a major contradiction.  No public witness was joined in the investigation by 

the   IO.     Ld.   Trial   court   has   failed   to   appreciate   that   according   to   IO   he 

examined tenant Mahavir but he was not cited in the list of witnesses.   No 

weapons of offence was recovered.  It is mentioned that no name of accused 

persons was given by the injured to the doctor.  It is also mentioned that ld. 

Trial Court has committed illegality while recording the statement of accused 

persons u/s. 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Cr.P.C</a>. It is prayed that judgment dated 23.12.2014 and order 

on sentence dated 12.01.2015  passed by the ld. MM be set aside. 



</p><p id="p_4">3.              The   above   mentioned   case   was   registered   on   the   statement   of 

complainant  Vijender Singh S/o Sh. Suraj Bhan to the police to the effect that 

he is working as a  Head Constable. On intervening night of 28/29.06.2010  at

Rajender  is involved in blocking the road and Rajender took bricks from his 

plot and blocked the road.  Thereafter, when electricity was restored and jam 

was opened, they left the bricks on the road.  The complainant and his tenant

 went there and picked the bricks   and placed them on the side of the road. 

When the complainant Vijender was returning to his house   then appellant 

Rajender came from Transformer side at once and restrained the complainant

were recorded. It is submitted by the accused persons that they have been 

falsely implicated in the present case.  All the accused persons had examined 

DW­1 Rattan Singh in their defence.  DW­1 has deposed that  he is relative of 

accused Rajender and complainant Vijender Kumar. There is dispute between 

the accused and complainant  with regard to land in village  Tilang Pur Kotla. 

This witness also deposed that on 24.05.2012, Panchayat was held in village 

Tilang Pur Kotla and the matter was compromised between both the parties 

and the copy of compromise was also proved before the ld. Trial Court as 

Mark­ A.

<p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">15.            I have heard the ld. Counsel for the appellants and the ld. Addl. 

PP for the State and perused the records of this Court as well as Trial Court 

carefully.  Ld. Counsel for the appellants had argued on the lines of grounds 



CA No. 6/15.                                                          Page No9/20
 taken by the appellants in their appeal.  On the other hand, ld. Addl. PP for the 

State has argued that there is no infirmity or illegality in the judgment dated 

23.12.2014.   The   ld.   MM   after   taking   into   consideration   all   the   facts   and 

circumstances of the case had rightly taken into consideration the statement of 

PW­1 and PW­3 and convicted all the appellants. It is prayed that the appeal 

be dismissed.  
</p>
<p id="p_27">

</p><p id="p_28">16.            Now, I am dealing with the contentions of ld. Counsel for the 

appellants one by one.
</p>
<p id="p_29"> 

</p><p id="p_30">17.            It   is   contended   by  ld.   Counsel   for  the   appellants   that   there   is 

delay of four days in the registration of the FIR and this delay is fatal to the 

case of the prosecution.  
</p>
<p id="p_31">               Admittedly, the incident is dated 28.06.2010 at 11:20 PM and DD 

No. 3A  dated 29.06.2010 was registered. As per  DD No. 3A, which is proved 

on record as Ex. PW­8/A, the complainant from his phone No. 9811157097 

made call that his cousin brother has quarreled with him and gave him injuries 

and   fractured   his   hand.     Thus,   intimation   was   given   by   the   complainant 

immediately   after  the  incident.   Admittedly, complainant Vijender suffered 

fracture in his hand and he was admitted at Ortho Plus Hospital and operated 

on   03.07.2010.   Thus,   if   the  complainant  due  to injuries   did  not  make  any 

statement to the police, it cannot be said that there was delay in lodging FIR 



CA No. 6/15.                                                                     Page No. 10/20
 and this delay is fatal to the case of prosecution. 
</p>
<p id="p_32">               Admittedly, PW­3 Manvinder Singh had not made statement to 

the police and as he had received simple injuries but IO had explained that he 

had visited the house of PW­3 twice but he did not meet him. I am of the view 

that prosecution and the complainant had duly explained the reasons for delay 

and this delay is not fatal to the case of the prosecution, particularly when the 

complainant was admitted and operated in Ortho Plus Hospital.  It is not the 

case that injured was discharged on the same day. Thus, this delay is not fatal 

to the case of the prosecution. 
</p>
<p id="p_33">

</p><p id="p_34">18.              It   is   contended   by   ld.   Counsel   for   the   appellants   that   the 

complainant has mentioned in his statement that he was taken to hospital by 

PCR but MLC of both the injured show that IO had taken them to the hospital. 

</p><p id="p_35">               PW­8 in his statement has stated that on receipt of DD No. 3A, he 

reached at the spot and came to know that injured persons had already been 

shifted to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital and thereafter, he went to Sanjay Gandhi 

Hospital     where   injured   Bijender   and   his   son   Manvinder   were   under 

treatment. PW­8 had himself stated that he also visited the hospital.   It can be 

feasible that along with the PCR, IO also reached at the hospital. Moreover, 

no clarification has been made by the counsel for the accused during cross 

examination  of PW­8 regarding this fact. Thus, this contention of the counsel 

for the appellants is not beneficial to the appellants. 



CA No. 6/15.                                                                    Page No11/20
</p><p id="p_36"> 19.             It is also vehemently contended by ld. Counsel for the appellants 

that   there   is   no   date   of   recording   statement   of   PW­3   Manvinder   u/s.   161 

<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11">Cr.P.C</a> by the IO.  
</p>
<p id="p_37">               I am of the view that how the appellants are benefited if the IO 

had not put any date on the statement of Manvinder recorded u/s. 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12">Cr.P.C</a>. 

Moreover, counsel for the accused persons had not asked any question from 

IO regarding not mentioning of date on the statement of Manvidner recorded 

u/s. 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_13">Cr.P.C</a>.  Thus, this contention is not helpful to the appellants. 



</p><p id="p_38">20.            The next contention raised by the counsel for the appellants is 

that PW­3 had stated that his statement was recorded at Ortho Plus Hospital 

but PW­8 IO had stated that statement of Manvinder Singh was recorded at 

the home. 
</p>
<p id="p_39">               I   have   perused   the   statement   of   Manvinder   Singh.   PW­3 

Manvinder Singh has stated that his statement was recorded at Ortho Plus 

Hospital   and   PW­8   IO   had   stated   that   statement   of   Manvinder   Singh   was 

recorded at his home.   If the IO had stated that the statement of son of the 

complainant i.e. Manvinder Singh was recorded at home,   I am of the view 

then it is not beneficial to the appellants, when PW­1   &amp; PW­3 had given 

detail version of the incident  and ld. Counsel for the accused persons was not 

able to shatter the testimonies of PW­1 &amp; PW­2 in any manner. 



CA No. 6/15.                                                                  Page No. 12/20
</p><p id="p_40"> 21.            It is contended by ld. Counsel for the appellants that ld. Trial 

Court has failed to appreciate that IO had also examined Sh. Mahavir, tenant 

of   the   complainant   and   the   IO   intentionally   under   the   influence   of   the 

complainant has not cited Mahavir in the list of witnesses. 

</p><p id="p_41">               I have perused the record. If the IO had not mentioned the name 

of Mahavir in the list of witnesses then it is not helpful to the appellants. 

Morever, if Mahavir is witness to the incident then the appellants should have 

produced Mahavir as defence witness.   As Sh. Mahavir was not produced as 

defence witness  by the appellants, I am of the view that this contention is not 

helpful to the appellants. 
</p>
<p id="p_42">

</p><p id="p_43">22.            It is vehemently contended by ld. Counsel for the appellants that 

PW­3 had stated that he was caught hold by Neetu, Nirmala and Vinay gave 

beatings to him with wooden sticks but PW­1 Bijender Singh had stated that 

accused Jitender caught hold Manvinder and accused  Vinay gave beatings to 

him  with wooden stick.   The complainant in his statement to the police has 

mentioned the names of sons of Rajender Singh as Neetu @ Jitender, Sonu  @ 

Manoj, Monu @ Vinay. Thus, appellant Neetu @ Jitender is  the same person. 

The complainant specifically stated in his statement that name of appellant as 

Neetu @ Jitender.  
</p>
<p id="p_44">               PW­3 Manvinder Singh has deposed that Neetu caught hold him 


CA No. 6/15.                                                                 Page No13/20
 whereas   Vinay   and   Nirmala   Devi   started   beating   him   with   "danda". 

PW­1 complainant stated that in the meantime his son Manvinder came to 

rescue   him   and   accused   Nirmala   and   Jitender     caught   hold   his   son 

Manvinder and accused Vinay gave beating to him with wood and danda. 

Thus,   appellant   Neetu   @   Jitender   is   the   same   person   and   there   is   no 

contradiction regarding holding of PW­3 by accused Neetu @ Jitender. 



</p><p id="p_45">23.            It is contended by ld. Counsel for the appellants that ld. Trial 

Court has committed illegality while recording the statement of accused u/s. 

313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_14">Cr.P.C</a>, as the ld. Trial Court recorded common statement and common 

answers of appellants due to which conviction upheld is improper 

               I have perused the record. Separate statements of all the accused 

persons have been recorded u/s. 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_15">Cr.P.C</a>  including accused Nirmala Devi 

(acquitted   by   the   Trial   Court).     Thus,   it   cannot   be   said   that   the   accused 

persons were  ever  prejudiced. It  is not the case of the appellants that  any 

incriminating   question   was   not   put   to   them   and   that   has   been   taken   into 

consideration by the ld. MM in the judgment. Thus, this contention of the 

counsel for the appellants carries no force. 
</p>
<p id="p_46">

</p><p id="p_47">24.            It   is   contended   by   counsel   for   the   appellants   that   there   is 

contradiction in the statements of PW­1 &amp; PW­3. 
</p>
<p id="p_48">               I have perused the statements of PW­1 &amp; PW­3.  PW­1 stated 


CA No. 6/15.                                                                     Page No. 14/20
 that when he was returning to his home, accused Rajender came there 

from the side of the transformer and he started using abusive language 

and   also   restrained   and   started   beating   him.       Thereafter,   accused 

Rajender called his sons  and stated that they would learned him a lesson. 

In   the   meantime   accused   persons   namely   Jitender,   Manoj   and   Vinay 

present in the court today who are the sons of accused Rajender and wife 

of   accused   Rajender  namely Nirmala present in  the court  today came 

there.  Sonu @ Manoj was armed with rod and Jitender and Vinay with 

wooden sticks and accused Rajender caught hold him and his sons started 

beating   him   with   rod   and   wooden   sticks.   In   the   meantime   his   son 

Manvinder came to rescue him and accsued Nirmala and Jitender caught 

hold   his   son   and   accused   Vinay   gave   beatings   to   him   with   wood   and 

danda.  Accused Rajender threatened him that if he tried to contact the 

police then he will kill him. 
</p>
<p id="p_49">               PW­3 Manvinder Singh deposed that on the day of incident i.e. 

28.06.2010 at about 11:20 PM, the electricity in their locality has failed. 

He heard loud noises appearing from the outside gali. He went there and 

found   that   accused   Rajender   Singh   was   quarreling   with   his   father. 

Accused Rajender Singh, Manoj, Neetu, Vinay and Nirmala Devi were 

beating his father.   Accused Rajender Singh had caught hold his father 

and Manoj was beating his father with iron rod. This witness stated that 

CA No. 6/15.                                                               Page No15/20
 at the moment he arrived there Neetu caught hold him whereas, Vinay 

and Nirmala Devi started beating him with danda. Villagers  came there 

and rescued them.  Accused Rajender Singh threatened them that if they 

call police he will kill them. 
</p>
<p id="p_50">                I   am   of   the   view   that   evidences   of   PW­1   &amp;   PW­3   are 

corroborating.  The counsel for the accused is not able to give any dent to the 

testimonies of PW­1 &amp; PW­3 during cross examination. A suggestion was 

given   by   counsel   for   the   accused   to   PW­1   that   accused   Nirmala   was   not 

present at the time of the incident. The counsel for the accused has not given 

suggestion to PW­1 that any of the appellants were not present at the time of 

incident.  Both the witnesses deposed that accused Manoj was having iron rod 

in his hand and he gave iron rod blow to the complainant.  Both the witnesses 

deposed   that  accused  Vinay had given blow with wooden sticks "lathi" to 

PW­3.     Both   the   witnesses   deposed   that   complainant   was   caught   hold   by 

accused Rajender Singh and Manvinder Singh was caught hold by Neetu @ 

Jintender. Both the witnesses stated that accused Rajender Singh threatened 

them   that   if   they   call   the   police,   he   will   kill   both   of   them.     Perusal   of 

documents   Ex.   PW­7/A   and   Ex.   PW­7/B   show   that   injured   Manvinder 

received simple injury and complainant/ injured Bijender received grievous 

injury and his left arm got fractured.   PW­7 Dr. Manoj Dhingra has proved 

that he had given the opinion on the MLC and according to MLC and X­ray 

report no. 3269, there is fracture of radius bone left side and the injuries 


CA No. 6/15.                                                                        Page No. 16/20
 are grievous in nature.  The counsel for the accsued is not able to shatter the 

testimonies of PW­7 Dr. Manoj Dhingra in any manner.    PW­7 specifically 

stated   that   injury   on   the   person   of   Manvinder   Singh   cannot   be   self 

inflected. 
</p>
<p id="p_51">

</p><p id="p_52">25.            It is also contended that there was a dispute between PW­1 and 

appellant   Rajender   Singh   and   DW­1   has   placed   on   record   a   copy   of 

compromise as   Mark­ A.     The incident is dated 28.06.2010 whereas DW­1 

has proved compromise of Panchayat dated 24.05.2012.  I am of the view that 

this document Mark­ A is not beneficial to the accused when the incident is of 

dated 28.06.2010 and this document pertains to 24.05.2012.   Moreover, this 

document   was   not   put   to   PW­1   during   his   cross   examination.     Rather 

suggestion was given to PW­1 that 'it is correct that there was no enmity 

between his family and family of accused  Rajender'.  Thus, testimony of 

DW­1 cannot be relied upon. 
</p>
<p id="p_53">26.            In view of the above discussions, I do not find any infirmity or 

illegality in the impugned judgment dated 23.12.2014 passed by the trial court 

in Case FIR No. 148/10 and it is upheld. The appeal filed by the appellants is 

without any merits and same is hereby dismissed.
