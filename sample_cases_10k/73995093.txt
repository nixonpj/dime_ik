ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">                Vide this order, I shall decide an appeal filed by the appellant 

against  the impugned  order  dated  20.01.2011  passed  by  the  Ld. Trial 

Court  whereby   the  ld.  trial  court  allowed  the  application  filed  by  the 

respondent no. 1 filed under Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2 CPC. The brief facts 

giving rise to filing of the present appeal are as under:­ 

  MCA no. 3/2011                                                                                Page  1 of 6
 2                  As per the plaintiff he is the owner of the property bearing 

No. 1141­42, Paharganj, New Delhi.  Shop No. 1142 was in possession 

and occupation of defendant no. 1 prior to the demolition drive carried 

out in June 2010 at the rent of Rs. 400 per month.  The MCD had issued 

directions to all the shop keepers in the area that land was required by the 

MCD  for the road widening purposes and removal of the encroachment 

of the area.   Pursuant to demolition drive carried out by the MCD, the 

shop   under   the   tenancy   of   defendant   no.   1   has   been   completely 

demolished,   however,     plaintiff/respondent   on   26.6.2010   saw   that 

defendant  no.  1  had  illegally  put  up a shutter  outside  the demolished 

shop which was in existence prior to the demolition, thus, attempted to 

create a shop  which  physically  does  not  exist.   The plaintiff  inquired 

from defendant no. 1 about the illegal and wrongful act committed by 

him but he instead of removing his shutter started harassing the plaintiff. 

On   the   basis   of   the   above   allegations   the   plaintiff   filed   a   suit   for 

declaration, mandatory and permanent injunction against the defendant.  

3                  Pursuant to the summons defendant appeared and filed his 

written statement taking preliminary objection that defendant no. 1 is a 

tenant in respect of shop no. 1142, Pahar Ganj, New Delhi.   That the 

court   has   not   jurisdiction   to   try   this   suit,   no   suit   against   the 

Commissioner,   MCD   is   maintainable.     That   suit   has   been   filed   for 



  MCA no. 3/2011                                                                                Page  2 of 6
 declaration   that   no   notice   under   Section   478   of   the   Delhi   Municipal 

Corporation Act has been served on the MCD before filing the suit.  Suit 

is   barred   under   <a href="/doc/843823/" id="a_1">Section     19</a>   of   the   Slum   Areas   (   Improvement   &amp; 

Clearance) Act.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                    On merit it is stated that MCD  for road widening purposes 

had taken  4 feet portion  in front of the shop of defendant no. 1 and shop 

in question now  measures only 7" width and 8' in length.  The defendant 

no. 1 is the tenant in respect of the said shop in question and MCD does 

not require remaining space in question. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">4                    The Ld. trial court heard the arguments on an application 

under Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2 CPC and passed the impugned order dated 

20.01.2011 thereby restrained the defendant from using the area of 6" 

inches between the wall and shutter and further from using space in front 

of the shutter till the pendency of the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_4">5                  Feeling aggrieved by impugned order passed by the ld. trial 

court,  the appellant/defendant has filed the present appeal.

6                  Ld. counsel for the appellant contended that defendant is the 

tenant   in   the   shop   in   question   @   Rs.   400   per   month,   thus   the   suit 

premises   falls   within   the   jurisdiction   of   Rent   Control   Act   and   the 

jurisdiction   of   the   court   court   is   barred   under   Section   50   of   the 

D.R.C.Act.  He also contended that MCD had taken only 4 feet portion 


  MCA no. 3/2011                                                                                Page  3 of 6
 from the shop of the appellant and remaining portion of shop measuring 

7"  in width and 8 ' in length is in the possession of the appellant.  

</p><p id="p_5">                   ld. counsel for the appellant further contended that ld. Trial 

court   passed   the   impugned   order   on   the   bases   of   surmises   and 

conjectures prayed that appeal be accepted and impugned order be set 

aside.
</p>
<p id="p_6">7                  Per Contra ld. counsel for the respondents contended that ld. 

trial court has passed a reasoned order after taking into consideration the 

material   placed  on  record.    He further contended  that  the  entire shop 

which was in possession of defendant no. 1 was demolished pursuant to 

the   demolition   drive   and   defendant   subsequently   installed   his   shutter 

illegally.  He further contended that relationship of landlord and tenants 

come to an end after the demolition of the shop. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">8                  I have heard both the ld. counsel for the parties and perused 

impugned  order dated  20.01.2011 as well as the material available on 

record.  It is admitted case of both the parties that shop which was under 

the   occupation   of   the   the   appellant   was   demolished   pursuant   to   the 

demolition drive initiated by the MCD.   
</p>
<p id="p_8">9                  As   per   the   respondent,   the   entire   shop   was   demolished 

pursuant to the demolishion drive carried out at the instance of the MCD 

whereas  as  per  the  appellant  only  4 feet  of  the  area of  the  shop  was 


  MCA no. 3/2011                                                                                Page  4 of 6
 demolished and taken for road widening purposes and remaining portion 

of the shop remains in occupation of the appellant.  The plaintiff in Para 

7  of  the  plaint  has   mentioned  that  " on  26.06.2010  plaintiff  saw  that 

outside   the   demolished   shop,   defendant   no.   1   had   illegally   put   up   a 

shutter outside the razed/demolished shop which was in existence prior 

to   the   demolition.     The   appellant/   defendant   has   filed   his   written 

statement   and   denied   the   said   averment   in   Para   7   of   the   written 

statement, however it has not been pointed out by the defendant as to 

when the said shutter was installed by the defendant.  The appellant has 

not given any  particulars, qua  the installation of the said shutter on the 

outer wall by the appellant.  The appellant was inducted as a tenant in a 

shop, which was subsequently demolished by the MCD.   The tenency 

being a transfer to enjoy the property so transfered.  However, when the 

property   itself   was   demolished,   the   lease   cannot   be   considered 

continuing   because   there   can  not  be  a lease  subsisting  in regard  to  a 

property not in existence.     The question whether the entire shop was 

demolished or any part of the same was demolished can only be decided 

after the conclusion  of the trial.   The ld. trial court while passing the 

impugned  order dated  20.01.2011 has rightly  held that area of 6 inch 

depth without roof cannot to be stated a shop in question and defendant 

cannot be allowed to work on the said space specially when the shop 

which was under tenancy of defendant no. 1 stands demolished by the 

  MCA no. 3/2011                                                                                Page  5 of 6
 MCD.
</p>
<p id="p_9">10                   I find no informity in the order dated 20.01.2011 passed by 

the ld. trial court.   The appeal is accordingly dismissed.  However, any 

view expressed while deciding the present appeal shell not be treated an 

expression on merit of the case.  Trial Court record be immediately sent 

back.  Appeal file be consigned to record room after due compliance.
