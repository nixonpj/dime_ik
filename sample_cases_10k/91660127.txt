CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE SANJAY KUMAR
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 17-11-2017

                The plaintiff of Title Suit No. 103 of 2000 which is pending

   in the court of Sub-Judge-VI, Bhojpur (Ara), is petitioner before this

   Court. He has filed this application for setting aside the order dated
 Patna High Court CWJC No.22094 of 2013 dt. 17-11-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          2/4</span>




        12.08.2013 whereby and whereunder the Court below accepted the

        documents filed behalf of the defendants for admitting in evidence,

        subject to payment of cost of Rs.500/-.
</p>
<p id="p_22">                       2. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner

        is that the defendants have filed the documents against the provisions

        of law as provided under Order 13 Rule 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil

        Procedure. It has been submitted that after framing of issues, the

        plaintiff has examined as many as ten witnesses. After three years of

        examination of plaintiffs witnesses, the respondents-defendants filed

        eighteen documents as per list of documents. The Court below

        without assigning any good reason, has accepted the same and so the

        same is fit to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_23">                       3. The learned counsel for the respondents submits that

        the documents, which have been filed, are known to the plaintiff and

        are very important for adjudication of controversy/dispute between

        the parties. The plaintiff has filed the suit for declaration that the deed

        of gift dated 11.01.1999 executed by one Jagdish Pandey in favour of

        Deo Dashi Devi (respondent no. 6) is forged and fabricated document

        and not binding on the plaintiff. The suit was originally filed against

        the father of defendant and after his death, the present respondent

        defendant has been added as party to the suit. The respondent-

        defendant got the knowledge about the document only when he
 Patna High Court CWJC No.22094 of 2013 dt. 17-11-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          3/4</span>




        discovered it in his house. He has filed the same in the Court without

        causing any delay. This document is registered document and the suit

        has been filed to set aside the aforesaid deed of gift. The main issues

        between the parties is adjudication of issue relating to deed of gift as

        to whether the same is genuine document duly executed by the doner

        in favour of the respondent nos. 6 and 8.
</p>
<p id="p_24">                       4. <a href="/doc/898412/" id="a_1">In Sarbanand Paswan vs. Mahendra Prasad Singh</a> case,

        1999(1) P.L.J.R. 118, a Division Bench of this Court has held that it is

        settled law that, if the documents are found to be relevant to decide

        the real issue in the controversy and when the Court felt that interest

        of justice requires that the documents may be received, exercising the

        power under Order 41, Rule 27 C.P.C. the appellate court would

        receive the documents and consider their effect thereof. When such is

        the position, when the documents are sought to be produced in the

        trial court, before the arguments are completed, normally they may be

        received, and opportunity be given to prove them and rebuttal if any

        and their relevance and effect they may have, be considered in

        deciding the issues arising in controversy. Under these circumstances,

        the trial court was not justified in refusing to condone the delay and to

        receive the documents.
</p>
<p id="p_25">                       5. It is the case of the petitioner that the documents

         were not in possession of the petitioners and after the death of
            Patna High Court CWJC No.22094 of 2013 dt. 17-11-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                     4/4</span>




                    father he found those documents in a box and filed the same

                    without causing any delay. Therefore, there is no question of delay

                    in filing in Court. Even if there was some delay in filing the said

                    documents, the Court should have taken lenient view in condoning

                    it as has been held by the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/752514/" id="a_2">Billa Jagan

                    Mohan Reddy vs. Billa Sanjeeva Reddy and others</a> (1994) 4 S.C.C.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                    659.</span>

</p><p id="p_26">                                 6.     In view of above discussions I find that the Court

                   below has not committed any jurisdictional error in accepting the said

                   documents for the purpose of evidence. The plaintiffs have challenged

                   the genuineness of said deed of gift and for adjudication of issue

                   under controversy, these documents are relevant and the same have

                   been rightly accepted by the Court below. This application is devoid

                   of merit and is accordingly dismissed.
