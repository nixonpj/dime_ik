               S.B. CIVIL MISC. APPLICATION No. 47 of 2008

                                     IN

              S.B. CIVIL MISC. APPLICATION NO. 74/2005

                           SMT. YOGESHWARI KUMARI &amp; ORS.


    Mr. MS SINGHVI &amp; Mr. ARUN BHANSALI, for the appellant /
petitioner

    Mr. JP JOSHI, Mr. MIRNAL KANTI, Mr. S.MUKHERJEE &amp; Mr.
    PS CHUNDAWAT, for the respondent


    Date of Order :                       13th July, 2009


                      HON'BLE SHRI N P GUPTA,J.

                             ORDER
</pre>


<p id="p_1">         This application has been filed on behalf of

respondent no.1 in Civil Misc. Application No. 74/2005,

hereafter to be referred to as the applicant, impleading

the petitioner of Application No. 74/2005 as respondent

no.1, and four more respondents being respondents no. 2 to

5 in the said Application No. 74/2005. The present

application has been filed under Section 152 C.P.C. read

with Section 151 C.P.C. for correction of date in S.B.

Civil Misc. Application No. 74/2005 Smt. Yogeshwari Kumari

Vs. Arvind Singh Mewar &amp; Ors., decided on 5.9.2007.



</p><p id="p_2">         The averments of the application are, that civil

Misc. Application no. 74/2005 was filed under <a href="/doc/941334/" id="a_1">Section 301</a>

and <a href="/doc/1637693/" id="a_2">302</a> of Indian Succession Act for removal of executor.

When the application came up before the Court on 17.8.2007

the matter was adjourned for two weeks, with a direction to

the parties to produce material on record in support of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                               2</span>

their respective stand. The office fixed 3.9.2007 as the

date for listing the matter, but then it was not listed on

3.9.2007, and came up before the Court on 5.9.2007, on

which date, after hearing submission on behalf of the

parties, the Court dismissed the Application No. 74/2005.

It is then alleged in para-5, that it appears that due to

accidental slip, in the order passed by this Court on

5.9.2007, the date of order has been indicated as 3.9.2007

on page 1 of the order and at page 10 line 6 of the order,

which factually should have 5.9.2007. Then, in para-6 it is

pleaded that above accidental slip came to the knowledge of

the applicant when he was served with the notices of D.B.

Special Appeal Civil No. 19/2008 Smt. Yogeshwari Kumari Vs.

Arvind Singh Mewar, wherein the fact that the matter was

listed in court on 5.9.2007, and the order was allegedly

passed by the Court on 3.9.2007, has been made basis for

challenging the order dated 5.9.2007. Then, in para-7 it is

pleaded that Civil Misc. Application No. 74/2005 was listed

before, heard and decided by the Court on 5.9.2007, in the

presence of counsel for the parties, and that the matter

did not appear in the cause list dated 3.9.2007. Thus, it

was pleaded that it is apparent, that due to accidental

slip or omission, the date 3.9.2007 has been indicated in

the order instead of 5.9.2007, the same needs consideration

of this Court for correction. With this, it is prayed, that

the date be corrected at both the places to be 5.9.2007 in

place of 3.9.2007.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">       This petition came up in the Court on 4.9.2008; on

which date notices were ordered to be issued, returnable

within three weeks, and were give dasti. Then, on 6.11.2008

fresh notices were ordered to be issued, and one set of

notice was directed to be sent by registered post. Then, on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                               3</span>

6.3.2009, when the matter came up, Mr. Singhvi informed

that to his information as gathered from the computer,

reply has been filed on behalf of respondent no. 1 on

11.12.2008. Therefore, the office was directed to locate it

and place it on record, and at the same time the Dy.

Registrar (Judicial) was also directed to enquire into the

matter, and submit a report on the factual aspect of the

matter, as to how the things, as alleged in the appeal, and

as alleged in the application have come about. The name of

the counsel who may be appearing on behalf of any of the

respondent and/or, who may have filed reply, should also be

shown in the cause list, and the matter was directed to be

listed after four weeks. Then, the matter came up on

4.5.2009 by which time the report of Dy. Registrar

(Judicial) was received, and Mr. Joshi prayed for time to

look into the report, therefore, the matter was adjourned

to 14.5.2009. This date 14.5.2009 was given because

otherwise I was sitting in Division Bench, and on 14.5.2009

other S.B. matters were also fixed to be listed before me.

Then, on 14.5.2009 Mr. Joshi submitted that he has applied

for certified copy of the report of Dy. Registrar (Judl.)

on 4th itself which he has received on 12th only, and

therefore, prayed for time to make submission on that

report. Accordingly, the matter was adjourned to 9.7.2009,

on which date, the matter was heard. On that day appearance

was put in on behalf of the applicant, and the present

respondent no. 1 and 4 only.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">        A reply to this petition had been sent by post by

Shri Vishvaraj Singh, the present non applicant no. 4,

which appears to have been received by the Registry on

25.9.2008. In parawise reply, regarding para-1 it was

denied being part of record, and referring to para-2 of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                               4</span>

preliminary objection, wherein referred Civil Writ Petition

No. 74/2005. Then, paras no. 2 to 5 have been replied as

answering respondent is not aware of the contents. However,

regarding para-5 it is pleaded that the matter be

investigated, as the accidental slip had not occurred just

once but twice. Then, para-6 has been denied, and it is

pleaded, that it is misleading to state that the matter of

incorrect dates is the basis of the appeal. Regarding para-

7 it was pleaded, that the answering respondent is not

aware.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">         Then, a reply has been filed on behalf of the

present respondent no.1 Smt. Yogeshwari Kumari on

10.12.2008, pleading interalia, that the non applicant

denies each and every allegation, averment, contention

and/or submission made in the present application which is

contrary to, and/or inconsistent with what is stated herein

below, and in the D.B. Civil Special Appeal No. 19/2007, as

well as in the records of the case, and unless specifically

admitted. Then, as preliminary objection, the submissions

have been made. In para-1 it is pleaded that the non-

applicant has already challenged the judgment dt. 3.9.2007

by preferring appeal, in which appeal the main ground is,

that the order passed by the learned Judge is liable to be

set aside mainly on the ground, that on 3.9.2007 the matter

was not listed before the learned Single Judge and,

therefore, there was no occasion for him to have decided

the application filed by the appellant under <a href="/doc/941334/" id="a_3">Sections 301</a>

and <a href="/doc/1637693/" id="a_4">302</a>. The judgment is said to have been pronounced on

3.9.2007, when the matter was not listed before the learned

Single Judge. Therefore, the question of the order coming

into existence on 3.9.2007, does not arise. The order

passed by the learned Single Judge is liable to be set
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                               5</span>

aside, for this reason alone. Then, in para-2 it is pleaded

that the application is misconceived and misleading, and

that the applicant is guilty of stating incorrect facts,

stating half truths, stating facts out of context. Instead

of filing an objection in the said appeal, the applicant

has filed present misconceived application. It is pleaded

that it is not just believable, that the alleged accidental

slip came to the knowledge of the applicant only when he

was served with the notice of the said appeal filed by the

non applicant no.1, wherein the judgment/order impugned in

the said appeal having been passed on a date when the

matter was not listed, has been taken as a ground for

challenging the judgment. It is pleaded, that the alleged

accidental slip ought to have, and must have, come to the

knowledge of the applicant immediately upon getting a copy

of the said judgment/order dt. 3.9.2007 or the certified

copy thereof, rather the application is only a ploy to

extend the period of limitation for filing the said

application. Then, in para-3 it is pleaded that an

application for review has been filed in the garb of the

said application for correction of date, and has been filed

for the sole purpose of having a hearing on review

petition, which is not permissible under the rules of High

Court, particularly when the judgment/order has already

been challenged, and is pending before the Division Bench

of this Court. Then, in para-4 it is pleaded that the

discrepancy and/or the error in the said judgment/order dt.

3.9.2007, which is being sought to be corrected by filing

the said application, is not in the nature of typographical

error, and as such, if at all such correction can be made,

it could have been done only upon the filing of an

application for review, limitation where for has already

expired. As such, the applicant cannot now be permitted to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                               6</span>

do the same indirectly, what he failed to do directly by

not filing an application for review. It is also pleaded

that after passing of the judgment/order dt. 3.9.2007 this

Court becomes functus officio for anything other than an

application for review, as it would tantamount to intrusion

into the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court, before which

the said appeal has been filed. With raising these

preliminary objections parawise reply has also been

incorporated. In parawise reply paras 1 to 3 were pleaded

to relating to matter of record requiring no reply.

Regarding para-4 it was pleaded, that so far as it relates

to matter of record, it needs no reply. However, it was

denied that the non applicant no. 1 on 5.9.2007 was heard

at all. It was specifically purportedly pleaded, that as

mentioned in the appeal, that on 5.9.2007 Shri Vivek Patwa,

Advocate appeared on behalf of counsel for the non

applicant no.1 Mr. J.P. Joshi, and made a request, that the

matter be adjourned, whereupon the Hon'ble Court made some

query and informed the advocate appearing on behalf of Mr.

Joshi, that the order will be passed in the case later on.

As such it is misleading and incorrect to allege, that the

non applicant no. 1 was heard on the said date. Contents of

para-5 were denied, pleading it to be contrary to record of

the case. Para-6 was denied. It was reiterated what has

been said in the preliminary objection no. 2, to the effect

that it is just not believable that the alleged accidental

slip came to the knowledge of the applicant only when he

was served with the notice of the appeal, wherein order

having been passed on the date when the matter was not

listed has been taken as a ground for challenging the same.

It was also maintained that the alleged accidental slip

ought to have and must have come to the knowledge of the

applicant immediately upon getting a copy of the said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                               7</span>

judgment. As such it was contended that the averments in no

circumstances can be accepted as reasonable, cogent,

plausible, and the same is an after thought, and only a

ploy to extend the period of limitation for filing the said

application. Then, para-7 was denied. It was maintained

that the non applicant no. 1 was heard by the Court on

5.9.2007 in the presence of counsel for the parties, as

alleged. Then, para-8 was also denied. It was denied that

it is an accidental slip or omission, and it was pleaded

that since the order dt. 3.9.2007 has already been appealed

against and the said appeal is pending, the correction

sought would tantamount to intrusion into the jurisdiction

of the Appellate Court.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">         Affidavit in support of this reply has been filed

pleading "the statements of facts in the accompanying reply

are true to my knowledge and/or are true to the records of

the case. Rest of the statements in the accompanying reply

are in the nature of submissions to this Hon'ble Court".



</p><p id="p_11">         The Dy. Registrar (Judicial) in his report has

reported, that the matter was listed before the Court on

17.8.2007, and on that date, the matter was adjourned for

two weeks, with a direction to the parties to produce

material on record in support of their respective stand.

Thereafter, the office fixed the next date as 3.9.2007, for

listing the matter in the Court for passing order. A

perusal of cause list dated 3.9.2007 reveals that the

matter was not listed before the Court on 3.9.2007, and it

was listed on 5.9.2007, at S.No. 3 in the cause list. It is

also reported, that it is evident from the record of the

result of the cause list, that the matter was dismissed on

5.9.2007. Then, he has perused the stenographer's diary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                8</span>

maintained by private secretary, which revealed, that the

order was not dictated on 3.9.2007, and the computer print

of the file history from the properties in the computer was

taken, which showed that it was created in the computer by

the concerned stenographer on 11.9.2007, and was modified

on 12.9.2007. He has produced the necessary material on the

basis of which he submitted the report.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">        To this report objections have been filed on behalf

of the present non applicant no. 1. First preliminary

objection raised is, that the non applicant questions the

opinion given by the Deputy Registrar on 1.5.2009, and also

disputes the contents thereof. It is pleaded that the

report is contrary to and/or inconsistent with the records

of the case, inasmuch as, the main issue of dispute has not

been addressed at all. It is pleaded that the contents of

the report are contrary to and/or inconsistent with not

only the records of the case but also to the statements of

the non applicant no.1, which has not been denied anywhere,

that in fact no hearing took place on the date which was

scheduled to be fixed, either on 3rd or on 5th of September,

2007. It was reiterated that the judgment/order has already

been challenged by way of appeal by raising the grounds

mentioned above. The second preliminary objection raised is

that the Dy. Registrar's report is tailored not only to

support and second the applicant's contention, as would

appear from the application, rather the Dy. Registrar has

traveled beyond the ambit and scope of report sought by the

Court, by giving a conclusive opinion, which includes

persuasive elements and recommendations motivating

conclusions indicating possible future actions that this

Court may take. The report is also contended to have gone

beyond its purpose of reporting to/informing this Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                               9</span>

with regard to the specific query. Third objection raised

is that on 5.9.2007 the non applicant no. 1 was not heard

by this Court, inasmuch as Mr. Vivek Patwa learned Advocate

appeared and sought an adjournment/accommodation on behalf

of Mr. J.P. Joshi, who was to appear and argue the case on

behalf of the non applicant, whereupon this Court made some

query and observed that some order would be passed later

on. As such the contention of the applicant about the

matter being heard on 5.9.2009 is incorrect, and is not

borne out from the records/proceedings of the case. The

order impugned in D.B. Civil Special Appeal No. 19/2007

pending before the Division Bench is erroneous in the fact

and circumstances of the case, to the effect that since no

hearing took place on 5.9.2009, this Court in no

circumstance could have recorded the submissions of either

of the parties, as has been recorded at page 10 of the said

order, sought to be corrected. Then, parawise comments have

also been made, and therein para-1 has been contended to be

requiring no comment. Then, regarding para-2 it was pleaded

to be requiring no comment. However, it was specifically

denied, that the case was dismissed on 5.9.2007 which is

contrary to record. Then, para-3 was also pleaded to be

requiring no comment. Then, regarding para-4 it was pleaded

that the report relates to matters of record, and as such

need no comment. However, contents of para-4 of the report,

in any case would remain same whether the matter was

decided on 3.9.2009 and/or 5.9.2009. Then, regarding para-5

of the report it was reiterated that what has been stated

herein above in the preliminary objections to the effect

that Deputy Registrar's report is tailored not only to

support and second the applicant's contention as would

appear from the application for correction of the date, but

has also traveled beyond the ambit and scope of a report

sought by this Court by giving a conclusive opinion which

includes persuasive elements and recommendations,

motivating conclusions indicating possible future actions

that this Court may take. Interalia with this it is pleaded

that the report deserves to be rejected by this Court, and

the present petition requires to be dismissed.



</p><p id="p_14">       These objections are also supported by the affidavit

of non applicant no.1 verifying the facts, to the effect

that "the statements of facts in the accompanying objection

petition are true to my knowledge and/or are true to the

records of the case. Rest of the statements in the

accompanying objection petition are in the nature of

submissions to this Hon'ble Court".
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">         Arguing the application, it was contended by the

learned counsel for the applicant, that at page-1 and in

line 6 of page-10 the date "3.9.2007" has come to be

mentioned only as accidental slip, or omission while it

should have been "5.9.2007" as neither the case was listed

on 3.9.2007, nor was it heard, and was actually heard on

5.9.2007. It was contended that the question as to whether

the matter was heard or not in the matter sought to be

contended by the non applicant is a question which is

already subject matter of appeal, and need not be gone into

in this application. Then, it was submitted that an over

all reading of the pleading, even comprised in the reply,

there is no dispute, that the order has been passed on

5.9.2007, and simply because by accidental slip the date

has been mentioned as 3.9.2007, on which date even

according to the non applicants neither the matter was

listed, nor was heard, the order could possibly not be

passed on 3.9.2007. Then, it was submitted, that it is not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                              11</span>

a case of review, rather it being only an accidental slip,

or omission, which is required to be brought to the notice

of this Court only, and for that purpose relied upon four

judgments, being Bhagwati Prasad Vs. Delhi State Mineral

Development Corporation reported in (1990) 1 SCC-361 (Para-

</p><p id="p_17">5), Central Bank of India Vs. Brajlal Kapurchand Gandhi

reported in AIR 2003 SC-3028 (Para-11 &amp; 12), R.S.E.B. Vs.

Narmda Industries reported in 1992(3) WLC (Raj.)-458 (Para-

</p><p id="p_18">17), and Ram Kanwar Vs. Kewal Singh reported in 2006(1) WLC

(SC)-92 (Para-2). It was then submitted, that as a matter

of fact on 5.9.2007 Mr. Vivek Patwa, appeared on behalf of

Mr. Joshi, he argued the matter for about half an hour, and

after hearing both the sides, Court pronounced the order of

dismissal, and observed, that the order will be dictated in

the chambers, and it is precisely for this reason, that now

Mr. Vivek Patwa is not coming before this Court, nor has he

dared to file affidavit in support of the plea taken in the

reply, lest that might have amounted to contempt of Court

on his part. Then, commenting on affidavits of non

applicant no. 1, it is contended that those affidavits are

no affidavits in the eye of law, as she was neither present

in the Court, nor had she deposed the facts/information

received from Mr. Vivek Patwa, as such, the facts could

possibly be not true to her personal knowledge. As such the

affidavits are no affidavits in the eye of law, and are

simply required to be discarded.
</p>
<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">         Mr. Joshi, on the other hand submitted, that it is

only an attempt to overreach appellate forum. It was then

contended that the applicant has not given details of dates

of his filing application for certified copy of the order,

or about his having received the copy of the order. Then,

referring to para-2 of the affidavit, it was contended that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                              12</span>

the verification is proper. It was maintained that the

applicant can always make submissions, that are being made

before this Court, before the appellate forum. It was also

submitted that since the matter is already pending before

the Division Bench, proceeding with this application

amounts to contempt of Court, and for this purpose reliance

was placed on a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in A.

Haleem Vs. M.S. Tajudeen reported in 1994 Supp (3) SCC-644.



</p><p id="p_21">         Since the argument was not clear, it was pointed

out to Mr. Joshi, that he should clarify as to what he

means in this submission, i.e. whether it would be

amounting to contempt on the part of the applicant, or on

the part of the Court, and after hesitating a lot, he

submitted, that contempt will be committed by this Court. I

then straightway advised him to initiate appropriate

proceeding for contempt, to which he submitted, he does not

propose to initiate any such contempt.
</p>
<p id="p_22">

</p><p id="p_23">       Then, regarding Dy. Registrar's report it was

submitted, that there is no basis for this report, it is

beyond the point referred, rather it is not a report on the

point referred.

<p id="p_24">

</p><p id="p_25">         I have considered the submissions, and have gone

through the papers, and the judgments.

<p id="p_26">

</p><p id="p_27">         At the outset, so far A. Haleem's case is

concerned, the matter, that was pending before the Hon'ble

Supreme Court, related to selection of trustees to

Madrasathul Salalhi Fir Adrabail Kilhai, a trust, which

trust was founded in the year 1980, and after the death of

the founders, dispute arose, and a scheme was framed by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                              13</span>

Court, and the administration of trust was carried on in

accordance with the Scheme Decree modified from time to

time. For the administration of the trust six hereditary

trustees were required to be selected from three main

branches of the founders, two from each branch, besides non

hereditary trustees to be selected by the District Judge,

and in all there were to be nine trustees. The correctness

of the selection ultimately reached the Hon'ble Supreme

Court, and by the order dt. 18.9.1991 it was directed, that

the then trustees could continue upto 31.5.1992. Thereafter

a new set of trustees was to be appointed by proper

advertisement in the newspapers inviting applications, and

if any objection was made to any one of the trustees, the

High Court was directed to look into the same. Pursuant to

that order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court the learned

District Judge called the application, and by his order dt.

25.9.1992 he selected respondents no. 1 to 9. A revision

was preferred challenging that selection, which was

dismissed by the High Court. Challenging that, special

leave petition was filed. Therein, on 16.8.1993, order was

passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, noticing that vide

order dt. 15.4.1993 the Hon'ble Supreme Court reconstituted

the Board of Trustees pending disposal of the special leave

petition, nominating certain persons, and keeping certain

persons out, meaning thereby that the entire constitution

of Board was seized of, and pending decision of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court, and no other court had jurisdiction or

business to interfere with the cause of the matter pending

before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, inspite of that clear

position respondent no. 5 moved application before the

learned District Judge, which was entertained for removal

of one of the trustees nominated by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court, and the District Judge did not reflect any thought
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                              14</span>

on the propriety of entertaining the application, and of

issuing notice on the application. In such circumstances,

it was noticed, that the conduct of respondent no. 5 in

moving the application amounts to an attempt to directly

interfering with the proceeding by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court, besides being wholly improper. It was observed that

this kind of litigation to fire the proceedings of this

Court, and embarrass the Chairman nominated by this Court,

should be put down, and notices were issued, as to why he

should not be punished for contempt. With this explanation

was called from the District Judge also, and it was

observed, that whether any further action should be

initiated against the District Judge would be considered

after consideration of his explanation. The explanation was

received. Then, the matter came up, and it was observed,

that the District Judge has been callous in entertaining

the application, in spite of the knowledge, that this Court

was seized of the matter, and secondly there is remiss on

his part in directing notice in a cavalier fashion, even

without looking at the array of the parties, or going

through the contents of the application. However, apology

tendered by the learned District Judge was accepted, as the

application had been dismissed by the learned District

Judge on 17.8.1993, and the proceedings were dropped. In my

view, this case, apart from fact, that it has no bearing on

the controversy involved in the present case, rather has

been cited, as an attempt on the part of the learned

counsel for the non applicant Mr. J.P. Joshi to brow beat

this Court, more so when he dared to submit that it amounts

to contempt on my part. Admittedly there is no order

whatever by the Division Bench, contrary to which any

application might have been filed, much less entertained.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                              15</span>

</p><p id="p_28">         In the totality of circumstances, I stand advised

to keep restrain on myself, and resist from taking any

stern action against Mr. Joshi, for making this type of

submissions.
</p>
<p id="p_29">

</p><p id="p_30">         Coming to the merits of the application, all said

and done, even invoking my personal memory, the order was

not dictated on 3.9.2007. As the material has come on

record, even in the present pleading of the parties, that

the matter was listed on 5.9.2007 the matter was called,

and according to Mr. Singhvi the matter was heard, and on

behalf of Mr. Joshi Mr. Vivek Patwa made submissions, and

after hearing both the sides, Court pronounced the order of

dismissal, and observed, that the order will be dictated in

the chambers, while according to Mr. Joshi, some query was

put by the Court to Mr. Patwa, and then he was informed

that the order will be passed in the case later on (as

pleaded while replying para-4 of the application).   Thus,

admittedly the matter was listed on 5.9.2007, and was heard

on 5.9.2007. May be that Mr. Joshi did not appear on

5.9.2007, and instead Mr. Patwa appeared, who has not dared

to come forward to file any affidavit, which could be

affidavit on his personal knowledge, as to what transpired

in the Court on 5.9.2007, as to what was detail of the

query put in the Court, and in what background the query

was put, and what was the answer of the query put by the

Court, and what remained to be done in the matter after the

Court receiving reply of that query from Mr. Patwa, and

then what was pronounced by the court. May be, that the non

applicant no. 1 may be feeling, that sufficient opportunity

of hearing was not given, on the parameters, as assumed by

him, but then, opposing this application is not forum for

ventilating that grievance.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                               16</span><p id="p_31">



</p><p id="p_32">          I may also observe at this stage, that I get from

my personal notes as I maintain, that as a matter of fact,

the judgment in this case was dictated by me to my private

secretary on 9.9.2007, at my residence, in the morning

hours, which was transcribed by him, and after making

necessary corrections of typographical mistakes in the

print, a fresh print was taken out, and that was signed. Of

course, I could not notice, that the date in the judgment

at the two places, being at page no. 1 and at page no. 10

in the 6th line, has been incorrectly mentioned to be 3rd

September, 2007, while it should have been 5th September,

2007. Obviously, when admittedly on 3rd September, 2007     the

matter was not listed nor was heard, it could not be as

appeared at page no. 10 of the order, that on 3rd September,

2007 the counsel for the respondent invited my attention to

Annexure R 1/9, and made submissions, as contained in that

para. This all actually happened on 5.9.2007, and this was

the query put, and this was the answer given, this was the

conclusion as I could arrive at, and after receiving the

answer from Mr. Patwa I had pronounced the dismissal of the

application, and gave out that the detailed order would be

dictated in chambers, which ofcourse could be dictated on

9th September 2007 only. Correctness of my conclusions is of

course subject matter of decision by Division Bench,

therefore, regarding correctness of conclusions I am not

supposed to make any observation.
</p>
<p id="p_33">

</p><p id="p_34">        So far present application being the correct forum

is concerned, the judgments cited by the learned counsel

for the applicant are complete answer to the objection, and

in view of these judgments, in my view, the present

application, is the only appropriate forum. The error
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                              17</span>

pointed out is only an accidental slip, or error, plain and

simple, having no bearing on the merits of the matter, and

is clearly correctable in an application under Section 152

C.P.C. May be that a review also could be filed for this

purpose, but then, it cannot be said, that Section 152

C.P.C. is not appropriate forum, permissible to be invoked.



</p><p id="p_35">       I do not hesitate in admitting, that one should have

been more cautious in reading every letter and word of the

judgment, in which event this error would not have

occurred. To commit error is human, and the non applicant

is simply trying to make mountain out of a mole, which too

does not exist. I may simply refer to page 3 and 4 of the

objections to the report of Dy. Registrar (Judicial),

submitted by the non applicant no. 1, and notice, that at

page 3 in para-3, in the 9th line, it is mentioned, that

hearing of the Civil Misc. Application no. 74/2005 took

place on 5.9.2009 is incorrect. Obviously we are only in

July, 2009, and September, 2009 is yet to come. Likewise,

in this very para in the 14th line again the date has been

mentioned as 5.9.2009. Not only this on page no. 4 in para

3.4 again, the dates have been mentioned as 3.9.2009 so

also 5.9.2009, by submitting that the question would remain

same, whether the matter was decided on 3.9.2009 and/or

5.9.2009. Obviously, the case was neither decided on

3.9.2009, nor 5.9.2009. This I am mentioning only for the

purpose of showing, that there may be human error in

mentioning dates or figure. In the judgment it has occurred

at two places, while in these objections it has occurred at

four places. Be that as it may.
