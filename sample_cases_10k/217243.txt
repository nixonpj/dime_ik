<p id="p_2">            This appeal has been filed against judgment and order dated

August 8, 2001, vide which Dilbagh Singh, appellant No. 1( A-1) was

Kaur, appellants No. 2 to 4 respectively (A-2 to A-4) were convicted for

commission of above said offence with the aid of <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_2">Section 34</a> IPC. All the

appellants were sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and to pay a

fine of Rs. 1,000/- each with a default clause.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             The appellants are husband, brother-in-law, father-in-law and

mother-in-law respectively, of the deceased, namely, Asha Rani alias Ashu.

It was allegation against them that they, in the intervening night of 20th and

21st August, 1999, caused burn injuries to Asha Rani, due to which she died

on September 19, 1999.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             Case of the prosecution, as noted by the trial Court in para No.

2 of the impugned judgment, reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "Briefly stated, the facts of the prosecution case are that on

             21.8.1999, a police party headed by Inspector Kuldip Singh

             was present at Bus Stop of village Nag Kalan, where Harbhajan

             Singh accompanied by his father Nazar Singh approached the

             Inspector and got recorded his statement to the effect that he is

             resident of Mohalla Rajinder Nagar, Batala Road, Amritsar. He

             has one brother and four sisters, out (whom) three have already

             been married and one is unmarried. It is further alleged that his

             sister Asha Rani alias Ashu was married to Dilbagh Singh

             accused about 1 Â½ years back. At the time of her marriage,

             they had given to her sufficient dowry as per their capacity. It

             is further alleged that out of this wedlock, a son was born out to

             her who is aged about three months and his sister was again

             pregnant. After the marriage, the in-laws of his sister started

             maltreating her for bringing inadequate dowry. Accused Dalla,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> CRIMINAL APPEAL     NO. 455-DB OF 2001            -3-</span>

       brother-in-law (Jeth) of his sister was unmarried and he was not

       doing any work. In order to resolve the abovesaid problem of

       his sister, the complainant and his family members procured

       some land in village Nangli and they also helped her to

       construct her own house over there. They also contributed

       some amount for this purpose and rest of the expenses for

       construction of the house were incurred by his sister by

       disposing of her ornaments. The complainant further alleged

       that all the accused i.e. Husband Dilbagh Singh, his brother

       Dalla and father-in-law and mother-in-law of his sister Asha

       Rani used to give her frequent beating and pressurising her to

       bring more cash amount. His sister told all this to the wife of

       the complainant , namely, Harpreet Kaur who further told the

       same to the complainant.       Faced with this situation, the

       complainant had gone to his sister on 20.8.1999 to enquire

       about her. She told him that even in the morning, her in-laws

       had beaten her on account of her spending Rs. 50/- on grossery

       for the house. She also expressed that she apprehends that she

       may not be killed by her in-laws. It is further alleged that on

       21.8.1999, when the complainant had gone to his place of

       work, there he received a message that his sister Ashu has been

       doused with kerosene oil on the intervening night of

       20/21.8.1999.   The complainant and his father reached the

       hospital where Asha Rani was admitted for treatment. She was

       found to be conscious and she told them that father-in-law and

       mother-in-law caught her arms, Dalla accused gagged her
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> CRIMINAL APPEAL           NO. 455-DB OF 2001             -4-</span>

            mouth with a piece of cloth and Dilbagh Singh accused put

            kerosene oil on her and set her on fire."</blockquote><p id="p_5">



</p><p id="p_6">            Process of criminal law justice was put in motion on a

statement (Ex. PH), made by Harbhajan Singh (PW7), brother of the

deceased, which led to registration of an FIR (Ex. PH/2) in Police Station

Majitha at 9.10 PM on August 21, 1999. The deceased was admitted in the

Hospital by Dr. Jaswant Singh (PW2) on August 21, 1999, with burn

injuries. The Investigating Officer - Inspector Kuldip Singh (PW9), after

registration of the FIR, went to the spot on August 22, 1999, and took into

his possession one match box and one plastic cane against recovery memo

Ex. Pj . He also got prepared rough site plan with correct marginal notes.

He went to the Hospital and moved an application regarding fitness of the

patient on August 22, 1999. The doctor declared Asha Rani unfit to make

the statement vide endorsement Ex. PK/1. He also recorded statements of

the prosecution witnesses. He again went to the Hospital on August 23,

1999, however, returned back for want of availability of the concerned

doctor. On August 24, 1999, he again moved an application to know about

fitness of the patient. The Doctor declared the patient fit to make statement.

In the meantime, it appears that investigation was taken over by SI Paul

Singh, who moved an application on August 25, 1999, to the Chief Judicial

Magistrate at Amritsar, with a request that statement of Asha Rani be

recorded.   Application was marked to Manjot Kaur (PW13), Judicial

Magistrate Ist Class, Amritsar. She went to the Hospital and moved an

application to know about fitness of the patient. Vide opinion Ex. PT, the

doctor declared Asha Rani fit to make statement. To know her mental state,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> CRIMINAL APPEAL           NO. 455-DB OF 2001              -5-</span>

the witness named above put some questions to her. Thereafter, Asha Rani's

statement (Ex. PT/1) was recorded by Mrs. Manjot Kaur, Judicial

Magistrate Ist Class. The statement was read over to Asha Rani and she put

her left and right foot thumb -impression on the statement. Endorsement in

that regard was made by the witness, named above, and also by the Doctor.

</p><p id="p_7">            Asha Rani succumbed to her injuries on September 19, 1999.

The Investigating Officer prepared the inquest report and sent the dead body

for post-mortem examination, which was conducted by Dr. Gurmanjit Rai

(PW1). This witness has specifically stated that the deceased remained

admitted in the hospital from August 21, 1999, to September 19, 1999. It

was further deposed that superficial to deep burns were present on the

forehead, face, upper-limbs, front and back of abdomen and chest. Soles of

both feet and outer aspect of right lower limb , superficial and deep slough

had fallen of at places with peeling of skin. The burns on the body were to

the extent of 60%which were ante mortem in nature. Witness also stated

that cause of death was septicemia/ shock, as a result of burn injuries, which

were sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of nature.

</p><p id="p_8">            The Investigating Officer, on completion of investigation,

submitted final report in Court for trial. It is necessary to mention here that

initially, FIR was recorded under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_3">Sections 307</a> and <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_4">498-A</a> IPC. However,

after death of Asha Rani on September 19, 1999, offences punishable under

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_5">Sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_6">304-B</a> IPC were added in the FIR.      The     appellants     were

charge-sheeted for the above said offences, to which they pleaded not guilty

and claimed trial. The prosecution produced 14 witnesses and also brought

on record documentary evidence to prove its case.          On conclusion of

prosecution evidence, statements of the appellants - accused were recorded
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> CRIMINAL APPEAL           NO. 455-DB OF 2001              -6-</span>

under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_7">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. Incriminating material, existing on record, was

put to them. They controverted the same, claimed innocence and false

implication. However, they led no evidence in defence. It was also averred

by the appellants that Dilbagh Singh (A-1) was residing with deceased

separately from the other appellants - accused. The trial Court, on appraisal

of evidence, found the appellants - accused guilty , convicted and sentenced

them, as mentioned in earlier part of this order. Hence this appeal.

</p><p id="p_9">            It is an admitted fact on record that the marriage of appellant

No. 1 with the deceased was solemnised about 1 Â½ years before the date of

occurrence. Out of the wed lock, one child was born. It has also come on

record that on the date of occurrence, deceased was pregnant. The trial

Court, after noting contents of the statements made by Harbhajan Singh

(PW7), brother of the deceased, and Nazar Singh (PW8), father of the

deceased,   rightly held that the deceased was being maltreated by her

husband , throughout, from the date of her marriage. Both the above named

PWs have reiterated allegations of the prosecution, as mentioned in earlier

part of this order. They have specifically stated that there was a dispute in

the family. Dilbagh Singh accused came to them for financial help. He was

paid Rs. 5,000/- in cash. Deceased also sold her jewelry to construct a

separate house. It was further stated that the land was purchased in the

adjoining village Nangli and separate house was constructed thereon by the

appellant and the deceased in the year 1996. It has also come on record that

appellants No. 2 to 4 were residing at village Sham Nagar. It is also an

admitted fact that the occurrence had taken place at village Sham Nagar.

</p><p id="p_10">            Statement of the deceased was recorded by Mrs. Manjot Kaur ,

Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, (PW13). Reading of the statement indicates
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> CRIMINAL APPEAL            NO. 455-DB OF 2001             -7-</span>

that before recording it, necessary legal precautions were taken. To know

fitness of the deceased, opinion of the Doctor was sought, who gave the

positive opinion. Before recording her statement, some questions were also

put to the deceased, to test her mental condition. In her statement Ex. PT/3,

she has stated as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            "It is stated that on 12.8.1999, I was just to cleaning the utensils

            after taking meals along with my husband, Called me and said

            that he gave Rs. 400/- to me and keep Rs. 50/- for house hold

            expenditure and to give Rs. 350/- to him. In the evening when

            my husband came and demanded money, I borrowed house

            hold articles. My jeth and my husband gave beatings to me. My

            mother-in-law caught hold of my one arm and one arm my

            father-in-law. My Jeth put cloth in my mouth. My husband set

            me on fire. My son was just about 1 Â½ months. My mother -in-

            law concealed washing sop. She maltreated me. After setting

            me on fire no one allowed me to put me out. My neighbour put

            me out. My in-laws disallowed me to took the house. Then

            Sarpanch came and took me in the car to Hospital. They all

            should be convicted. I have nothing more to say."</blockquote><p id="p_11">



</p><p id="p_12">            From perusal of statement of the deceased coupled with other

evidence on record, it can safely be said that so far as participation of

Dilbagh Singh (A-1) and Hardayal Singh (A-2) in the crime is concerned,

the same is fully proved on record. Dying declaration inspires confidence

and the same has been recorded as per norms. The doctor remained present

throughout when statement of the deceased was recorded.                   Some
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> CRIMINAL APPEAL           NO. 455-DB OF 2001              -8-</span>

discrepancies here and there, as indicated by counsel for the appellants in

statements of the prosecution witnesses are of no help to the appellants, i.e.,

Dilbagh Singh and Hardial Singh alias Dalla Singh.
</p>
<p id="p_13">            Contention of counsel for the appellants that as the death has

occurred after about one month of the date of occurrence and it was the

result of septicemia, the trial Court was not justified in convicting the

appellants - accused vide the impugned judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_14">            This Court is of the view that the argument raised is liable to be

rejected. It has come on record that when the deceased was taken to the

Hospital, she had 60% burns on her body. She died on September 19,

1999. As per post-mortem report, burns were at her entire body. All the

burns were ante mortem in nature and were sufficient to cause death in

ordinary course. Death of Asha Rani is a direct result of criminal act of the

appellants No. 1 and 2. Faced with the situation, counsel for the appellants

has vehemently contended that there was no occasion for appellants No. 2 to

4 to be present at the spot. They have unnecessarily been dragged in the

litigation being relatives of appellant No. 1. This Court is of the view that

so far as participation of appellant No. 2 in the crime is concerned, the same

is proved on record. It has come on record that he is unmarried, doing no

work and had been teasing the deceased from the very beginning.

Otherwise also, the act of causing burns to the deceased appears to be a

handiwork of two persons and not one.
</p>
<p id="p_15">            So far as appellants No. 3 and 4 are concerned, this Court is of

the opinion that benefit of doubt can be given to them. Both are father-in-

law and mother-in-law of the deceased. They were of 73 years and 70

years of age respectively at the time of alleged occurrence. They remained
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> CRIMINAL APPEAL           NO. 455-DB OF 2001            -9-</span>

in jail for more than seven years. This appeal was filed through Jail. In the

dying declaration, which was recorded on August 25, 1999, it was stated

that both had caught hold of the deceased from her arms. This Court is of

the opinion that such an act may not be possible by the appellants No. 3 and

4 being very old. Evidence on record clearly indicates that appellants No. 3

and 4 were living separately from the deceased and her husband. Statement

of Harbhajan Singh (PW7) and Nazar Singh (PW8) was recorded before

recording the statement of the deceased. Both the witnesses have attributed

the same roll to appellants No. 3 and 4, which was subsequently attributed

by the deceased, to them, in her dying declaration. It has also come on

record that immediately after admission in the Hospital, parents of the

deceased reached there and they remained by her side throughout. Both the

witnesses have stated that the deceased was in semi-conscious state and had

told them facts about the alleged incident. It appears that the deceased

might have been tutored by the parents, in the meantime, before her

statement was recorded by the Magistrate. At present both the appellants

are more than / about 80 years of age.
</p>
<p id="p_16">              Their lordships of the Supreme Court have specifically noted

in <a href="/doc/1263837/" id="a_8">Kans Raj v. State of Punjab</a>, AIR 2000 Supreme Court 2324, and <a href="/doc/561262/" id="a_9">Sham

Lal v. State of Haryana</a>, AIR 1997 Supreme Court 1873, that it has

become tendency in matrimonial disputes, to drag all relatives of the

husband, in criminal litigation. A caution was given to the Courts to make

an attempt to separate truth from falsehood. Appellants No. 3 and 4 are

very old. They were not to be benefited if any dowry/ amount was to be

paid by the parents of the deceased to appellant No. 1. Allegations against

appellants No. 3 and 4 do not inspire confidence, benefit of which will go to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> CRIMINAL APPEAL          NO. 455-DB OF 2001             -10-</span>

them.
</p>
<p id="p_17">            In view of above, this appeal is dismissed qua appellants No. 1

and 2, they be taken in custody to undergo remaining part of their sentence.

However, it is allowed qua appellants No. 3 and 4 and they are acquitted of

the charges framed against them.
