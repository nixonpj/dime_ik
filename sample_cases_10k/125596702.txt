       IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI
                                         Decided on:- 20th April, 2018

+      CM (M) 1367/2011 &amp; CM No. 21211/2011

       SAMEER WASON &amp; ANR.                          ..... Petitioners
                   Through:            Mr. P.K. Rawal, Adv.

                          versus

CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.K.GAUBA

                   ORDER (ORAL)
</pre><p id="p_1">1.     The petitioners claim to be landlords qua the respondent in
respect of premises described as shop on ground floor in property no.
53, Old Rajinder Nagar Market, Delhi, the tenancy statedly having
been created by Rent Agreement dated 15.07.1988.             They had
instituted a case for eviction (petition no. E-185/1998) in the Court of
Additional Rent Controller on 21.12.1998 invoking grounds under
Section 14 (1) (a), (b) and (j) of <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_1">Delhi Rent Control Act</a>, 1958. The
case was contested by the respondent on all counts, evidence having
been led by each side. It eventually resulted in judgment dated
02.06.2003 whereby the Additional Rent Controller having found the
respondent guilty of being in default of payment of rent within the
mischief of <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_2">Section 14</a> (1) (a), closed the proceedings by granting the
benefit of protection under <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_3">Section 14</a> (2) of <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_4">Delhi Rent Control Act</a>,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CM (M) 1367/2011                                          Page 1 of 6</span>
 1958, the respondent (tenant) having complied with the order under
<a href="/doc/1987465/" id="a_5">Section 15</a> (1). There has been no challenge brought to the findings in
that regard or the result on that score by either side, the judgment of
the Additional Rent Controller to that extent having attained finality.
The Additional Rent Controller held, by the said judgment dated
02.06.2003, that the petitioners had failed to prove their case on the
ground under <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_6">Section 14</a> (1) (j) of <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_7">Delhi Rent Control Act</a>, 1958. The
said ground was not pressed by any appeal before the Rent Control
Tribunal and, thus, also needs quietus. The ground of sub-letting
under <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_8">Section 14</a> (1) (b) of <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_9">Delhi Rent Control Act</a>, 1958, however,
persists and has come up for fresh consideration before this Court
through the petition at hand.
</p><p id="p_2">2.     The Additional Rent Controller had granted eviction order on
the petition under <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_10">Section 14</a> (1) (b) of <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_11">Delhi Rent Control Act</a>, 1958
holding the respondent-tenant to have sub-let the premises. The
respondent-tenant had challenged the said finding and result. The
appeal (RCT 82/2009 old no. RCA 504/2003) was allowed by the
Additional Rent Control Tribunal by judgment dated 12.08.2011 and it
was held that the petitioners had failed to prove sub-letting. Thus, the
eviction order was set aside and the petition on that ground was
dismissed.
</p><p id="p_3">3.     Having heard the learned counsel on both sides and having gone
through the record, including the pleadings and the evidence (copies
whereof were submitted at the hearing), this Court finds no merit in
the petition.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CM (M) 1367/2011                                          Page 2 of 6</span>
<p id="p_4"> 4.     The case for eviction on the ground under <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_12">Section 14</a> (1) (b),
<a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_13">Delhi Rent Control Act</a>, 1958 was set out in the eviction petition thus:-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "That the respondent has already sub-letted, assigned
       and otherwise parted with the tenancy premises and the
       respondent tenant is not at all in possession thereof and
       sub tenant is in exclusive possession of tenancy shop. As
       per terms and conditions of the rent agreement the
       respondent has no right to sub-let, assign or otherwise
       part with the possession of the tenancy premises, hence
       the present petition on the ground of sub-letting".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">5.     The above ground was contested with following averments in
the written statement:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       "14 (1) (b). Sub-Para-under-reply is absolutely wrong
       and false and is emphatically denied. The allegations in
       the Sub-Para-under-reply are merely repetition of the
       earlier allegations of the petition and a suitably
       reply/written statement to the same has already been give
       above, which, for the sake of brevity, is not being
       reproduced herein, and it is prayed that the same may
       please be read as part of the reply to the Sub-Para-
       under-reply. The petition, being false, frivolous and
       baseless, is liable to be dismissed, with punitive costs. It
       is wrong and is denied that the respondent has Sub-
       letted, assigned or otherwise parted with the tenancy
       premises or the respondent is not in possession thereof or
       that it is any alleged sub-tenant who is in possession of
       the tenancy shop. The terms of the agreement of rent are
       matters of record, however, the respondent has not
       violated any of the terms of said agreement date 18.7.88
       of rent. The petitioner on the alleged ground of sub-
       letting is false, baseless ad malafide, and is having no
       substance or truth in the same. The respondent himself is
       in use, occupation and possession of the tenanted shop,
       wherein he in the company of his son, has been running


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CM (M) 1367/2011                                            Page 3 of 6</span>
          the business if stationer, books, etc. (including cold
         drinks)".
</blockquote><p id="p_6">6.       The second petitioner appeared in evidence (as AW-2), reliance
being placed additionally on the evidence of certain other witnesses,
the prime effort of the petitioners to prove that the respondent had sub-
let the shop to his son Arun Sood, and that he was in exclusive use of
the premises, running his business in the name and style of M/s Sood
Store.     These facts were sought to be demonstrated, inter alia, by
photographs (Ex. AW-2/22, 26 and 28), and the evidence of Chander
Pal (AW-1), Section Officer from Mahanagar Telephone Nigam
Ltd.(MTNL) and Rajesh Anand (AW-4), Clerk-cum-cashier, Oriental
Bank of Commerce, old Rajinder Nagar, New Delhi. The respondent,
on the other hand, examined himself (as RW-2), also examining Gulab
Singh (RW-1), another official from the aforementioned bank in
addition to other witnesses including his son Arun Sood (RW-4). The
photographs depict display of the sign board of Sood Stores across the
subject premises. The respondent, in his evidence, did not deny the
presence of his son Arun Sood in the premises, his argument being
that he is assisted in the business run from the premises by his said
son, it also being not disputed that the son was engaged in the business
of Sood Store which was run simultaneously from the premises, it
being the case of the respondent that he continues to be in possession
and control of the tenanted shop.
</p><p id="p_7">7.       The evidence of the official witnesses from MTNL would show
that a telephone connection in the name of Arun Sood, son of the
respondent was installed in the premises. The evidence of the official


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CM (M) 1367/2011                                           Page 4 of 6</span>
 witnesses of the bank would show that Arun Sood, the son of the
respondent had opened a bank account in the name of Sood Stores.
</p><p id="p_8">8.     The learned counsel for the petitioners read extensively from
the evidence and the judgment of the Additional Rent Controller to
argue that the petitioners had proved the presence of a stranger in the
premises and, therefore, had discharged the burden of proof on the
ground of sub-letting and further that there was no satisfactory
explanation offered by the respondent and consequently the eviction
order granted by the Additional Rent Controller should not have been
disturbed by the Additional Rent Control Tribunal. Per contra, the
counsel for respondent relied on the judgment of the Additional Rent
Control Tribunal and argued that mere proof of existence of a
telephone connection in the name of the son and use of the address of
the suit shop by the son for opening a bank account in the name of M/s
Sood Store does not bring home the case of sub-letting, the evidence
of the respondent about he having continued to be in possession and
control being credible and rightly accepted by the appellate forum.
</p><p id="p_9">9.     Having accorded consideration to the rival submissions in the
light of pleadings and the evidence on record, this Court finds the
view taken by the Additional Rent Control Tribunal to be based on
correct appreciation of facts and proper application of law. There is no
evidence worth the name to show that while allowing his son to
simultaneously run the business of Sood Stores from the subject
premises, the respondent has effaced himself from the tenanted shop.
His evidence, duly supported by that of other witnesses including his
son (AW-4), as indeed that of Amarjit Singh (RW-3), Secretary of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CM (M) 1367/2011                                          Page 5 of 6</span>
 Market Association, leaves no room for doubt that the respondent-
tenant continues to be not only in use and occupation of the premises
but also engaged in the business run therefrom.
</p><p id="p_10">10.     There is no evidence of any monetary consideration flowing
from the son of the respondent to him for use of the subject premises
by the former. It is not a case of the tenanted premises having been
partitioned or any particular portion having been rendered in exclusive
use of a stranger by the tenant. In these circumstances, the view taken
by the Additional Rent Control Tribunal with reference to the rulings
in <a href="/doc/1106478/" id="a_14">Gulzar Singh Ors. vs. Sri Chand Gupta</a> 29 (1986) Delhi Law Times

does not call for any interference.
