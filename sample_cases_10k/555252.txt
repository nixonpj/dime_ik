:ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">	The petitioner prays for issuance of a writ, in the nature of certiorari,
to quash the demand notice issued by the Collector, Tirunelveli, asking the
petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs. 8,52,618/- [Rupees Eight Lakhs and Fifty Two
thousand six hundred and Eighteen only] representing the deficit of the stamp
duty.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2.The reading of the order shows, that the basis of the demand is an audit
objection, by the Accountant General.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3.It is not in dispute, that the lease deed in favour of the petitioner
was duly executed and registered by the Registrar.  In case of deficit stamp
duty, the recovery can be effected only under <a href="/doc/61287904/" id="a_2">section 33(A)</a> of the Indian Stamp
Act, which reads as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_4">	"33-A. Recovery of deficit stamp duty.- (1) Notwithstanding anything
contained in <a href="/doc/61287904/" id="a_3">section 33</a> or in any other provisions of this Act, if, after the
registration of any instrument under the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_4">Registration Act</a>, 1908 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_5">(Central Act</a> XVI
of 1908), it is found that the proper stamp duty payable under this Act in
respect of such instrument has not been paid or has been insufficiently paid,
such duty or the deficit, as the case may be, may, on a certificate from the
Registrar of the district under the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_6">Registration Act</a>, 1908 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_7">(Central Act</a> XVI of
1908) be recovered from the person liable to pay the duty, as an arrear of land
revenue:
</p>
<p id="p_5">	Provided that no such certificate shall be granted unless due inquiry is
made and such person is given an opportunity of being heard:
</p>
<p id="p_6">	Provided further that no such inquiry shall be commenced after the expiry
of three hears from the date of registration of the instrument.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	(2)The certificate of the Registrar of the district under sub-section(1)
shall, subject only to appeal under sub-section (3), be final and shall not be
called in question in any court or before any authority.
</p>
<p id="p_8">	(3)Any person aggrieved by a certificate of the Registrar of the district
under sub-section (1) may appeal to the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority. Any
such appeal shall be preferred within such time, and shall be heard and disposed
of in such manner, as may be prescribed."
</p>
<p id="p_9">	4.The impugned order, prima facie, is in violation of <a href="/doc/191322070/" id="a_8">section 33-A</a> of the
Act, as no enquiry was conducted by the learned Collector, nor the petitioner
was given an opportunity of hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_10">	5.It is well settled law that when a power is given under a statute, it
has to be exercised independently by statutory authority and not on instructions
of anybody else. The impugned order further shows that exercise of power was on
the direction of the Audit Department, and not independently.
</p><p id="p_11">	6.In any case, the order being against the provision of <a href="/doc/61287904/" id="a_9">section 33(A)</a> of
the Indian Stamp Act, reproduced above, it cannot be sustained in law.
</p>
<p id="p_12">	7.The writ petition is allowed, the impugned order is quashed. The liberty
is given to the respondents to pass fresh order in accordance with law, if so
permissible.  No costs.
