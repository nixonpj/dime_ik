                                             ...Respondents
(By Sri.Honnappa, HCGP for R1)

     This Criminal Petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> of
Cr.P.C. praying to enlarge the petitioner on bail in
Cr.No.27/2019 of BEML Nagar Police Station, K.G.F. For
the offence P/U/S 376 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a> and Sections 4 and 6 of
POCSO Act 2012.

     This Criminal Petition coming on for Orders this day,
the Court made the following:

                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

learned HCGP for the respondent-State. Perused the

records.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.    Petitioner   is   the   sole   accused   in   Crime

No.27/2019 of BEML Nagar Police Station, KGF, for the

offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_3">Section 376</a> of IPC and Sections

4 and 6 of POCSO Act, 2012.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span><p id="p_4">




</p><p id="p_5">      3.     Brief facts of the case are that, the victim girl

was admitted that she has undergone an abortion. During

that time the police have visited the hospital and recorded

the statement of the victim girl. She has disclosed that she

was aged about 18 years and in fact, the petitioner is her

close relative and son of her maternal aunt. They loved

each other and he was often visiting the house of the

complainant. Under that guise, they developed physical

intimacy and inadvertently, she became pregnant and

sustained some stomach pain and admitted to the

hospital.   In    that   context,    police   have   received     the

information from the hospital and recorded the statement

of the victim girl in the hospital.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">      4.     On perusal of the records, it shows that

actually there is no complaint as against the petitioner by

the victim girl, which could be seen from 164(5) <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Cr.P.C</a>

statement    recorded     by   the    jurisdictional   Magistrate,

wherein     she    has   categorically    stated     that   due    to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                4</span>




inadvertence and physical contact between herself and

petitioner, she became pregnant. In fact, petitioner is the

person, who took the victim girl to the hospital. The

petitioner was arrested and has been sent to judicial

custody. Investigation is completed and charge-sheet has

been filed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">      5.      Looking to the above stated facts, attraction of

POCSO Act is doubtful in the above circumstances, and

that could be established during the course of full dressed

trial. As the victim girl is crossed 17 years and she is in

the verge of attaining the age of majority and marriage of

the petitioner and the victim girl has been fixed, in my

opinion, the petitioner-accused is entitled to be enlarged

on bail. Hence, the following:
</p>
<p id="p_10">                            ORDER

      The Petition is allowed. Consequently, the petitioner-

accused shall be released on bail in connection with Crime

No.27/2019 of BEML Nagar Police Station registered for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               5</span>




the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_5">Section 376</a> of IPC and

Sections 4 and 6 of POCSO Act, subject to the following

conditions:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     (i)      The petitioner shall execute a personal
     bond for a sum of Rs.50,000/-(Rupees Fifty
     Thousand only) with one surety for the like-
     sum to the satisfaction of the jurisdictional
     court.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     (ii) The petitioner shall not indulge in tampering
     the prosecution witnesses.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     (iii)    The petitioner shall appear before the
     jurisdictional court on all the future hearing
     dates unless exempted        by the court for any
     genuine cause.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     (iv)The petitioner shall not leave the jurisdiction
     of the trial Court without prior permission of the
     court till the case registered against him is
     disposed of.
