                             W.P. 13147(W) of 2016

                              Nasima Khatun
                                    Vs.
                      The State of West Bengal &amp; Ors.

      Md. M. Hossain,
      Mr. Sandipan Maity
                    ..... for the petitioner

      Mr. Amitesh Banerjee,
      Mr. Tarak Karan
                     .... for the State


      Opinion of the medical board constituted by the C.M.O.H.,

Purulia, is placed on record. Such report be kept with record. Copy

of the report be handed over to the learned Counsel appearing for the

petitioner in Court today.

      I find from the medical report that the victim was suffering from

fever and general weakness and had been admitted to the local

hospital and thereafter referred to Bokaro General Hospital for better

treatment.   She was discharged from Bokaro General Hospital and

admitted to K.M. Memorial Hospital &amp; Research Centre Private

Limited, Jharkhand, where she ultimately dead due to cardio-

respiratory failure in a case of sepsis. Opinion of the medical board is

to the effect that as death of the victim was due to cardio-respiratory

failure in a case of sepsis which is due to progress of the ailments of

the victim, no post mortem of the victim was insisted upon.
                                     2


          It has been argued by the learned Counsel appearing for the

petitioner that body of the victim be disintered and subjected to post

mortem examination.

      It appears from the medical records placed before me that the

victim suffered from high fever and after protracted treatment in three

different hospitals expired due to cardio respiratory failure in a case

of sepsis. Prima facie, I find the conclusion of the Board as to the

cause of death of the victim to be a reasonable one. No allegation had

been made by the victim against her husband and/or in-laws during

her treatment at the said hospital prior to her death. There is nothing

on record to show that she suffered from any external or internal

injury.

      In view of the aforesaid facts, I am unwilling to accept       the

prayer of the petitioner to exhume the body of the victim       for post

mortem examination.       Investigation in the aforesaid case, however,

shall continue in accordance with law and be concluded at an early

date. Petitioner, as victim of crime, is at liberty to participate in the

proceeding before the criminal court in accordance with law.

      With the aforesaid observations, the writ petition is disposed of.

      Since no affidavit-in-opposition has been called for, the

allegations made in the writ application are deemed not to have been

admitted by the respondents.</pre>
