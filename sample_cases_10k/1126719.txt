                   M.A.C.A.No.903 OF 2006
             -----------------------------------------------------
           DATED THIS THE 13th DAY OF JANUARY, 2010

                           J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Basant, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     Insurer is the appellant.             First respondent claimed

compensation for injuries suffered by him in a motor accident.

According to him he was the pillion rider in a motor cycle, which

the 2nd respondent was riding and it was owned by the 3rd

respondent. It is the case of the claimant/first respondent that

the vehicle was insured with a valid policy of insurance by the

appellant herein.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     2.    Various contentions were raised. It is unnecessary to

advert to all those contentions. The Tribunal accepted the case

of the 1st respondent that he was a pillion rider and that the

accident had taken place on account of the negligence of the

rider of the vehicle. Accordingly, the court below found the rider

as well as the owner of the vehicle liable. As the vehicle was

covered by a valid policy of insurance, the Tribunal found that

that appellant/3rd respondent, i.e., the insurer of the motor cycle

was liable to pay the amounts to the claimant and indemnify the

insured.    Accordingly, the Tribunal proceeded to pass the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">MACA.NO.903/06             -2-</span>




impugned award.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     3.    The appellant claims to be aggrieved by the impugned

award.    What is the grievance?    The learned counsel for the

appellant submits that even on admitted facts, the appellant has

no liability to pay the compensation amount to the 1st

respondent/claimant and indemnify the insured.          The short

contention is that the policy insurance is an 'act only' policy and

the act only policy does not cover the pillion rider of the motor

cycle.    That contention was specifically raised before the

Tribunal. But the Tribunal had omitted to consider the same. In

these circumstances, it is contended that the appellant deserves

to be exonerated from the liability to pay amounts to the 1st

respondent/claimant and indemnify the insured.

</p><p id="p_5">     4.    Called upon to respond to the contention, the learned

counsel for the first respondent/claimant does not dispute the

fact that the policy of insurance is only an 'act only' policy and

the pillion rider is not covered under the terms of the policy of

insurance. The learned counsel for the appellant relies on the

decision in United India Insurance Co.Ltd. v. Tilak Singh

2006(4) SCC 404, i.e. 2006(2) KLT 884.
</p>
<p id="p_6"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">MACA.NO.903/06               -3-</span>




</p><p id="p_7">      5.   In the absence of a challenge against the contention

which was pleaded that the policy was only an 'act only' policy

and that the same does not cover the pillion rider, it follows that

appellant's contention has to be accepted and the appellant has

to be exonerated from liability.   The challenge in this appeal

succeeds.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      6.   The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent wants to

advance a contention that the 2nd respondent is not the real

owner and that some other person is the real owner and such

person, and not he, has been dealing with the vehicle as the

owner for a long period of time. No material whatsoever has

been placed before the Court. It is not disputed that the 2nd

respondent continues to be the owner as per the registration

certificate.  We need only mention that rights if any of the

owner/2nd respondent against the said person shall remain

unaffected by this judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      7.   In the result:
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">     (a)    this appeal is allowed.

     (b)    the impugned award in so far as it directs the

</pre><p id="p_10">            appellant/3rd respondent/insurer to pay the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">MACA.NO.903/06            -4-</span>




           amount to the 1st respondent is hereby set

           aside.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      (c)   In all other respects the impugned award is

            upheld.
