  advance rent of 11 months to the petitioner. He has read

  the written statement 4-5 days back. He has also read

  the statement of Sh. K.K. Rally simultaneously. He came

  to India on 19.03.07. He left India in flight scheduled at

  06.30 AM, which actually took off at 08.30 AM. He left

  his house about 04.30 AM. The writing Ex. RW1/2 was

  executed when all the people had came to see him off at

  residence and it was executed before he left his house.

  The petitioner was also present at that time. He denied

  the suggestion that latter dated 04.10.98 i.e. Ex. RW1/2

  was prepared subsequently of his departure. He denied

  the suggestion he was not given any consent by the

  petitioner by which he can authorise Sh. Krishan Kumar

  Rally to run his shop on his behalf in the presence of the

  petitioner. Ex. RW1/2 does not bear the signature of the

  petitioner. The witness volunteered submitted that no

  body sign Ex. RW1/2. He denied the suggestion that

  Chaman Lal had been giving rent in cash to the

  petitioner upto December, 2003 or that he was even
   receiving rent receipt upto that period. The witness

  volunteered submitted that Sh. Krishan Kumar Rally

  used to give rent and take receipt. He cannot recollect

  from which date he started making payment of rent by

  cheque. He cannot say if he had seen the contents of DR

  No. 255/05. He cannot say as to what exactly he meant

  when he write the fact with respect to contents of DR No.

  255/05 and he volunteered submitted that whatever he

  had written in his affidavit, he has written on behalf of

  Sh. Krishan Kumar Rally, again said he does not know

  what exactly is written in his affidavit with respect to DR

  No. 255/05. There is no attorney on record dated

  03.03.04 executed by him in favour of Sh. Krishan

  Kumar Rally. Sh. Krishan Kumar Rally is my co-brother

  and he volunteered submitted that he is my cousin also.

  He has not asked any detail of account regarding

  business from Kishan Kumar Rally so far. He has come

  to depose in this matter only to depose before this court.

  He denied the suggestion that he sub-let the shop to Sh.

  Krishan Kumar Rally and is charging        rent from him

  much higher than what he was supposed to pay to the

  petitioner. He denied the suggestion that he is deposing

  falsely at the instance of Sh. Kishan Kumar Rally.



</p><p id="p_26">11.     I have heard the argument of Ld. Counsels for the
   parties beside going through material on record carefully.



</p><p id="p_27">12.         In order to prove petition U/s 14(1)(b) of DRC Act

  the landlord is required to prove the following ingredients

  :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       a.         The relationship of landlord and tenant in

       between         the parties.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       b.         that the tenant has on or after 9.6.1952,

       sublet,         assigned    or     otherwise   parted   with

       possession of              whole or any part of the suit

       premises and

       c.         that he did so without obtaining consent of

       the landlord in writing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">

</blockquote><p id="p_28">13.         The   relationship    of    landlord   and   tenant   in

  between the petitioner and the respondent is admitted.

  Hence, it requires no further discussion.



</p><p id="p_29">14.         On the score whether tenant has sublet, assigned

  or otherwise parted with possession of the whole

  property is concerned, the initial burden to prove that

  the property in question was on the petitioner. In this

  case as per contention of the respondent, he has shifted

  USA in the year 1998 and he has authorized Sh. Kriahan

  Kumar as his attorney on the basis of oral appointment
 to perform all business activities on his behalf. Sh.

Krishan Kumar appeared in witness box as PW1 and

submitted that he is performing business activities since

4.10.98 on the basis of oral/written authentication by

Tarun Kumar Rally, the original tenant. In view of

judgment in case Abdul Aziz vs. Mohd.Yakoob, 1971,

AIRCJ 492, it was hold that once it is admitted that

persons other than tenant had been in the house, the

onus of explaining their presence was that on the tenant.

Further in case Narayan Ratan vs. Indian Mill Stores,

1977 RCR 551, it was inter alia held that "the question

whether there is unlawful sub-letting is, in most cases, a

matter of inference to be drawn from the facts of each

case. The initial onus or proving unlawful sub-letting, in

the first instance, lies upon the plaintiff. Subtenancy can

hardly be proved by direct evidence. All that the plaintiff

can do is to place on record certain circumstances from

which an inference has to be drawn. When such

circumstances are proved, prima facie, the burden

placed on the plaintiff is discharged, and the onus shifts

on the defendant not to prove any negative fact but

establish a positive aspect about the capacity in which

the alleged sub-tenant is occupying the premises, and

that he has not parted with the whole or a part of the

tenanted accommodation."
</p><p id="p_30">          In the instant case as discussed above it has been

  proved that at present Krishan Kumar is in possession of

  the tenanted premises, hence in the light of above

  judgments, now the burden shifts upon the respondent

  to prove that the property was not sublet, assigned or

  otherwise parted with by the respondent to Sh. Krishan

  Kumar.
</p>
<p id="p_31">

</p><p id="p_32">15.      The plea of the respondent is that even though he

  has shifted to USA in the year 1998 but he has

  authorized sh. Krishan Kumar a his attorney to perfom

  all his business activities on his behalf. The attorney on

  which the respondent is relying upon is dt. 4.10.98

  proved on record as Ex. RW1/2. The contents of the

  attorney reveals that the respondent has executed the

  same in favour of Sh. Krishan Kumar to perform all the

  business activities in the tenanted premises on his

  behalf and to release all the liabilities on his behalf i.e. to

  pay house tax, electricity charges, payment of rent etc.

  As matter of record the suit was contested by              Sh.

  Krishan Kumar on behalf of the respondent /original

  tenant on the basis of GPA dt. 4.12.04 proved on record

  as Ex. RW1/1 by respondent in favour of Sh. Krishan

  Kumar. In the written statement preliminary objection

  has been taken that when the respondent           has left for
 USA he has orally appointed Sh. Krishan Kumar as his

attorney to dealt with the tenatned premises on his

behalf. This fact was again referred by the respondent in

parawise replies on merits in the written statement.

First of all this question arises whether this document is

genuine one and if any reliance can be made on this

document. The authority letter Ex. RW1/2 was brought

on record in the evidence of RW1 Sh. Krishan Kumar.

During cross examination      this witness has submitted

that he cannot say if Ex. RW1/2 has been written in

presence of the petitioner or not.
</p>
<p id="p_33">       RW-2, Sh. P.S. Bindra has submitted that       Sh.

Krishan Kumar is performing business activities since

4.10.98 on the basis of oral agreement. RW3, Sh. K.P.

Banerjee has also submitted that on 4.10.98 the

respondent while leaving for USA has verbally authorized

Sh. Krishan Kumar to perform business activities in the

tenanted premises.
</p>
<p id="p_34">       Respondent    Tarun Kumar appeared in witness

box as RW-4. He has submitted tot he effect that on

4.10.98 at the time of leaving for USA he executed

authority letter in favour of Sh. Krishan Kumar Rally to

perform all the business action. He further submitted to

the effect that authority letter was executed by him in

presence   Sh. Krishan Kumar Rally, Sh. K.B. Banerjee
 and Sh. B.S. Bindra and Sh. P.S. Bindra. As discussed

above Sh. P.S. Bindra appeared in witness box as RW2

nd Sh. KB Banerjee as RW3 but both these witnesses

have categorically stated that the respondent        has

verbally / orally authorized Sh. Krishan Kumar to look

after his business activities. RW1   Sh. Krishan Kumar

during cross examination has submitted that he cannot

say if the petitioner was present on spot or not when

Ex.RW1/2 was written. Therefore, the testimony of all

the respondent    witnesses qua the execution of Ex.

RW1/2 is not corroborating each other. Ex. RW1/2 is

again perused. Except the respondent it does not bear

the signature of either   Sh. Krishan Kumar in whose

favour the attorney Ex. RW1/2 was executed nor it bears

the signature of SH. PS Bindra, Sh. B.S. Bindra or Sh.

K.B. Banerjee or even of the petitioner who was stated to

be present on the spot as per evidence of RW-4. There is

no explanation in the evidence of Rw4 that why the

signature of any of the said person was not obtained.

Moreover, the pleadings and evidence of the respondent

are not corroborating each other. As discussed above the

respondent   himself in the written statement    filed on

13.10.04 has submitted that he has orally appointed

Sh. Krishan Kumar as his attorney to look after his

business whereas he has testified to the effect that he
   has executed attorney in favour of Sh. Krishan Kumar

  when he appeared in witness box as RW-4.
</p>
<p id="p_35">

</p><p id="p_36">16.      From careful perusal of file it is found that the

  present petition was filed on 25.2.04, however, summons

  to the witnesses were ordered to be issued against the

  respondent on 1.4.04 by my ld. predecessor court. The

  service was effected upon the     Sh. Krishan Kumar on

  8.4.04.   Sh. Krishan Kumar has acepted the summons

  on behalf of the respondent         being cousin of the

  respondent. The written statement was filed on 5.5.04

  by Sh. Krishan Kumar on behalf of the respondent on

  the basis of GPA Ex. RW1/1 executed by the respondent

  in favour of   Sh. Krishan Kumar. It is Ex.RW1/1 GPA

  executed at New York, USA attested by Assistant

  Consular Officer, Consulate General of India, New York.

  It means for the purpose of filing written statement, the

  GPA Ex. RW1/1 was executed on the basis of which

  written statement was filed. Now the question arises that

  if   Sh. Krishan Kumar was in possession of authority

  letter Ex. RW1/2 executed on 4.10.98 then what was the

  necessity of executing GPA Ex. RW1/1 in favour of Sh.

  Krishan   Kumar.   All   these   circumstances   leads   to

  conclusion that no reliance can be made on Ex. RW1/2.
</p><p id="p_37"> 17.       The next contention of Ld. Counsel for respondent

  was that Sh. Krishan Kumar was running business on

  behalf of the respondent       since 4.10.98 when the

  respondent himself left for USA. It is submitted that Sh.

  Krishan Kumar has paid regular electricity bills and run

  business on behlaf of respondent. Reliance is made

  mainly on the evidence of PW2, Sh. P.S. Bindra who is

  stated to be an accountant and maintain the books of

  accounts of the respondent since 1.4.98. This witness

  was cross examined at length. During cross examination

  explanation regarding original books of accounts was

  called from this witness and he has stated that from Ex.

  RW2/PX1 to Ex. RW2/PX-14 i.e. all the books            of

  account does not bears his signatures. Further this

  witness has submitted that he has not mentiond in the

  accounts books that accounts have been prepared in the

  name of Tarun Kumar Rally, sole proprietor, or address

  thereof. All the account books are perused. Admittedly,

  in none of the account book the name of the respondent

  or residential address of the respondent is mentioned.

  In these circumstances, it cast suspicion regarding

  genuineness of books of account and accordingly, it does

  not help the respondent at all to prove that the business

  was regularly run from the tenanted premises since

  1998.
</p><p id="p_38"> 18.     The evidence of the material witnesses again

  perused. RW4 respondent            Tarun Kumar Rally has

  nowhere deposed that         even though the physical

  possession over the tenanted premises is of Sh. Krishan

  Kumar but he has right to retain the claim of possession

  from Sh. Krishan Kumar, nor he has submitted to the

  effect that he has any way is connected with the

  business run by Sh. Krishan Kumar from the tenanted

  premises i.e. regarding loss and profit in the business.

</p><p id="p_39">        On the other hand, RW1           Sh. Krishan Kumar

  during his cross examination        has submitted on this

  score and it is necessary to re-produce the important

  relevant portion of RW1, which is as under :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                "I have not sent any detail of profit

        and loss to the respondent since 1998 till

        date.   It   is    correct    that   whatever

        investment is in the shop is of mine.........

        It is correct that the shop in dispute is

        open by me, close by me and I am in

        possession of each and every part of

        it....... It is correct that Tarun Kumar has

        no sharing profit or loss nor he has any

        control over the business run by him in

        the tenanted shop."</blockquote><p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">          In case <a href="/doc/269615/" id="a_1">Kamla Devi (Mrs.) vs. M/s Hazi Amir

  Mohd. Mir Ahmed</a>, 2006 Vol 4 AD Delhi 423, Hon'ble

  High Court has inter alia, observed as under : -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">             There is little or no doubt that the so-called

       General Power of Attorney is doing business

       being a partner of a concern which is wholly

       independent of the original tenant. To contend

       that a General Power of Attorney would

       continue to hold the premises on behalf of the

       contractual tenant is not justified since no

       business is being conducted in the premises on

       behalf of the tenant and the tenant has no

       share or interest       in the premises which is

       being exclusively held by the so-called General

       Power of Attorney to the exclusion of the

       original tenant.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">

</blockquote><p id="p_42">19.      The findings of the said judgments are sqaurely

  applicable to the facts of the instant case as RW1 Sh.

  Krishan Kumar who at present is in possession of the

  tenanted premises has in unmistakable terms submitted

  to   the     effect   that   he   is   holding   the   business

  independently as he is investing the money and does not

  share any profit and loss with the respondent. It leads to

  the conclusion that the respondent has no control over
   the   business.    Moreover      as   discussed    above    the

  respondent has not even uttered a single word to justify

  the presence of Sh. Krishan Kumar on his behalf in the

  tenanted premises that he share loss and profit in the

  business run on his behalf by          Sh. Krishan Kumar.

  Therefore, the respondent has failed to justify the

  possession of      Sh. Krishan Kumar in the tenanted

  premises. Regarding obtaining the consent of landlord in

  writing, it is found that the respondent          has failed to

  bring on record      any document showing that              the

  petitioner   has   given   any    written   consent    to   the

  respondent allowing him to sublet, assigned or otherwise

  parted with possession of suit premises in favour of Sh.

  Krishan Kumar. Therefore, the petitioner has been able

  to prove his case U/s 14(1)(b) of DRC Act. Consequently,

  eviction order is hereby passed in favour of the petitioner

  and against the respondent in respect of the suit

  premises that is     one shop bearing private No. 2, in

  property No. IX/6143, Shivaji Gali, Gandhi Nagar, Delhi,

  as shown in red colour in the site plan, Ex. PW1/1. No

  order as to cost. File be consigned to Record Room.
