<p id="p_10">                          3. The learned counsel for the Appellant/Plaintiff Mr.Arun C.Mohan

                 submitted that the Assignment of Hindi Dubbing rights of the film 'Gorilla'

                 (Tamil) produced by the first Defendant-All in Pictures was made to the

                 Plaintiff/Appellant under the Assignment Agreement dated 20.1.2018,

                 however, the second Defendant-M/s.Goldmines Telefilms Private Limited

                 was also given the Hindi Dubbing Rights by Defendant No.1 with respect to

                 Telugu version of the said film 'Gorilla' under a separate Assignment

                 Agreement dated 16.11.2018. He submitted that the Telugu version of the

                 said movie is substantially similar to that of the Tamil version of the said

                 movie 'Gorilla' and therefore, the Assignment of Hindi version of Telugu

                 movie is likely to adversely affect and seriously prejudice the rights of the

                 plaintiff. He further submitted that on the Undertaking given by the second

                 Defendant, the learned Single Judge has recorded in the impugned order

                 that the Hindi version of the Telugu film shall be released only after 60 days

                 from the date of release of Telugu Version. The impugned order was passed

                 by the learned Single Judge in the Summer Vacations on 10.5.2019 in view

                 of the urgency shown by the parties that the Tamil version of the said movie

                 is likely to be released on 16.5.2019 itself.

</p><p id="p_11">                          4. During the course of hearing the present Appeals, at the admission

                 stage, the court asked a question to the learned counsel for the first

                 Defendant-Producer, Mr.S.Karthikei Balan, who submitted that the Telugu
http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                         5</span>

                 Version of the said movie is not even ready as of now and therefore, is not

                 likely to be released in the near future.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                          5. The learned counsel for the second Defendant, Mr.S.R.Raghunathan,

                 however, emphatically opposed the submissions of the learned counsel for

                 the Plaintiff/Appellant and submitted that even the present Appeals are not

                 maintainable as the Appellant/Plaintiff has no right over the Cinematography

                 film and therefore, claiming copyrights on that basis is not even available to

                 the Plaintiff/Appellant and the Appellant has got only Hindi dubbing rights of

                 the Tamil version of the film and the two Versions of the Film are different.

</p><p id="p_13">                          6. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are inclined to

                 dispose of the present Appeals with the following additional direction in

                 addition to the directions already given by the learned Single Judge on

                 10.5.2019 in the interlocutory order which is impugned before us.

</p><p id="p_14">                          7. In the facts and circumstances, we direct that the Telugu version of

                 the said film "Gorilla" shall not be released by the first Defendant without

                 obtaining specific leave of the learned Single Judge in the Civil Suit.      The

                 other directions given in the order dated 10.5.2019 shall stand.       With this

                 modification of the order dated 10.5.2019 indicated above, the present

                 Appeals are disposed of. No costs. The connected miscellaneous petitions

                 are closed.
