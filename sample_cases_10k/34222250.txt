<p id="p_1">         The petitioner has filed this petition against the

respondents U/Sec.166 of M.V. Act seeking compensation of

Rs.1,00,000/- with interest for the injuries sustained by him

in a motor vehicle accident.

under:
</p>
<p id="p_3">             On 21-5-2013 at about 3.10 p.m., the petitioner was

standing infront of Madduramma temple, Maddur, at that

time,        the   driver   of   the   car   bearing   registration

No.KA-02-MB-2243 drove the same in a rash and negligent

manner and dashed against the petitioner. As a result of the

said accident, the petitioner has fell-down and sustained

grievous injuries to his right leg.      At that time, the public
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3              MVC.No.2740/2014</span>

gathered at the spot have shifted the injured to the General

hospital, Maddur, wherein, he has taken first aid and

thereafter he was shifted to Hosmat Hospital, Bengaluru,

wherein, he has taken treatment as an inpatient for a period

of 2 days.   Further, the contention of the petitioner is that,

he has spent an amount of Rs.20,000/- towards medical,

conveyance and other incidental expenses.

</p><p id="p_4">      The contention of the petitioner is that, he was hale and

healthy at the time of accident, aged about 65 years, working

as a Supervisor at Hindusthan Petroleum Ltd., and drawing

salary of Rs.8,000/-p.m.    Due to the accidental injuries, he

has suffered lot and he is not in a position to work as he was

doing earlier to the accident. Further, the contention of the

petitioner is that, the accident has occurred due to rash and

negligent driving of the driver of the car.

</p><p id="p_5">      The first respondent is the owner of the offending car

and the second respondent is the insurer of the said vehicle
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  4               MVC.No.2740/2014</span>

and the policy was in force as on the date of accident. Hence,

both the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay

the compensation to the petitioner.         Contending the above

facts, the petitioner has filed this petition against the

respondents seeking compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- with

interest and cost.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      3. In response to the petition notice, the respondent

No.2 has appeared before the court through its counsel and

filed the objection statement. On the other hand, the

respondent   No.1    has   not   appeared    before   the   court.

Accordingly, it was placed exparte.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      4. The brief contents of objection statement of

respondent No2 are as under:
</p>
<p id="p_8">      The respondent No.2 has contended in the objection

statement that, the petition filed by the petitioner is

vexatious and frivolous.    Further the respondent No.2 has

denied the entire contents of petition averments in toto. The

respondent No.2 has denied the issuance of policy to the

offending car. On the other hand, the said policy was issued

to one Ford Fiesta bearing Engine No.JB8522 and Chasis

No.JB8522 and the policy was in force as on the date of

accident.   Hence, this respondent is not liable to indemnify

the first respondent.     Further the respondent No.2 has

denied the age, occupation and income of the petitioner and

also injuries sustained by him. Contending the above facts, he

prays to dismiss the petition against the respondent No.2.

PW-1. Further he argued that, the petitioner has proved his

case by producing oral and documentary evidence. On the

other hand, the respondent No.2 has not produced any

rebuttal documents to disbelieve the case of the petitioner.

Accordingly, he prays to allow the petition.

</p><p id="p_17">      11. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the

respondent No.2 argued by reiterating the contents of

objection statement filed by the respondent no.2.            Further

the counsel for the respondent No.2 argued that, the

petitioner has failed to prove his case as contended in the

petition    by   producing   oral       and   documentary   evidence.

Accordingly, she prays to dismiss the petition against the R-2.

</p><p id="p_18">      12.    On rival contention urged by both the counsel,

I intend to discuss the merits of the case.

</p><p id="p_19">      On perusal of the evidence on record, it reveals that,

the petitioner has examined himself as PW-1 and he has

stated in his evidence by reiterating the contents of petition

averments.     In support of his evidence, the petitioner has

produced the documents which are marked as Ex-P-1 to 7.

</p><p id="p_20">     Thereafter the counsel for the respondent No.2 has

cross-examined           the       PW-1         at      length.          In       the

cross-examination, the PW-1 has clearly stated that:

</p><p id="p_22">     13. On perusal of the above evidence, it appears that,

the defence of the respondent No.2 is that, the accident has

occurred due to negligent act of the petitioner. But to prove

the said defence, the respondent No.2 has not produced any

rebuttal documents. On the other hand, on perusal of entire

evidence of PW-1 it appears that, though the counsel for the

respondent No.2 has cross-examined the PW-1 at length, but
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                9               MVC.No.2740/2014</span>

nothing has been elicited from him to disbelieve his version

regarding rash and negligent driving of the driver of the car.

</p><p id="p_23">      14. Further on perusal of Ex-P-1 and 5 i.e. true copy of

FIR with complaint and the charge sheet, it appears that, the

Maddur Traffic Police have registered a case against the

driver of the car and after completion of investigation, the

concerned police have filed the charge sheet against the

driver of the car .
</p>
<p id="p_24">      15. On appreciation of evidence of PW-1 coupled with

documents and for the above reason, I am of the opinion that

the petitioner has proved that, the accident has occurred due

to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the car.

</p><p id="p_25">      16. On perusal of the evidence of PW-1 coupled with

the Ex-P-4 i.e. true copy of wound certificate, it reveals that,

the petitioner has sustained simple injury in the above said

accident.

documents and for the above reason, I am of the opinion that

the petitioner has proved this issue by producing oral and

documentary evidence. Accordingly, I answer this issue is in

affirmative.

<p id="p_29">      18.    ISSUE NO.2:- The specific contention of the

petitioner is that, prior to the accident, he was hale and

healthy, aged about 65 years, working as a Supervisor at

Hindusthan     Petroleum   Ltd.,   and     drawing   salary   of

Rs.8,000/- p.m.        Due to the accidental injuries, the

petitioner has suffered lot and he is not in a position to work

as he was doing earlier to the accident.

</p><p id="p_30">      19. On perusal of the evidence of PW-1, it appears that,

after the accident also the petitioner has continued the same

work in the same company. Hence, I am of the opinion that,

the petitioner has not entitled for compensation under the

head of loss of future income.

certificate, it shows that, the petitioner has sustained

lacerated wound over right leg 9 cm x ½ cm exposing and the

said injury is in simple in nature. Further on perusal of Ex.P.7

i.e. discharge summary, it appears that, the petitioner has

taken treatment as an inpatient for a period 2 days at Hosmat

hospital, Bengaluru.   Considering the above facts and also

looking to the nature of the injuries and period of

hospitalisation, I deem it just and reasonable to award an

amount of Rs.6,000/- under the head of pain and suffering

and Rs.3,000/- under the head of attendance, nourishment

and conveyance charges.
</p>
<p id="p_34">      21.   The petitioner has contended in the petition and

stated in his evidence that, he has spent an amount of

petitioner has sustained cut lacerated wound to the right leg

and he has taken treatment as an inpatient for a period of 2

days at Hosmat hospital, Bengaluru.       Considering the above

facts, I deem it just and reasonable to grant a compensation

of Rs.5,000/-under the head of medical expenses.

that, the respondent No.1 is the owner of the offending car

and the respondent no.2 is the insurer of the said vehicle. But

the specific contention of the respondent No.2 is that, the

respondent No.2 insurance company has not issued the policy

to the offending    vehicle.   On the other hand, the policy

Number shown in the petition was issued to one ford fiesta

vehicle.   But to prove the said fact and to disprove the

version of the petitioner, the respondent No.2 has not

produced any rebuttal document. Further, as stated above

that, the accident has occurred due to rash and negligent

driving of the driver of the car. Considering the above facts

and circumstances of the case       and for the above reason,

I am of the opinion that, the respondent No.1 and 2 are jointly

and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioner.

However, the respondent No.2 being the insurer is liable to

pay compensation of Rs.18,000/- with interest @ 9% p.a. from
