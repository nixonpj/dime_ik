         ORAL ORDER</pre>



<p id="p_1">               Heard learned advocate Mr. Samir Afzal Khan for the petitioner.
</p>

<p id="p_2">         2.    By invoking writ jurisdiction of this court what is prayed by the
         petitioner is a direction against respondent Nos. 1 and 2 being Central
         Public Information Officer &amp; Income Tax Officer, Ward No. 11(3),
         Ahmedabad and Joint Commissioner of Income Tax &amp; First Appellate
         Authority, Range-11, Ahmedabad respectively, to provide assessment
         orders for the years 2006-2007 and 2007-2008.
</p>

<p id="p_3">         3.    The petitioner invoked the provisions of the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_1">Information
         Act</a>, 2005, to seek aforesaid information from the Right to Information
         authorities. He was a partner of a firm named M/s. Raja Agency and in
         that capacity wanted copies of the income tax Assessment Orders.
</p>

<p id="p_4">         3.1   The application of the petitioner dated 26.05.2014 was not
         entertained on the ground that the information was relating to the third

HC-NIC                                Page 1 of 4      Created On Sat Apr 02 01:06:18 IST 2016
                     C/SCA/4479/2016                                             ORDER



         party. Against the said decision of the Public Information Officer, an
         appeal before the first appellate authority was preferred, which also came
         to be dismissed on 22.09.2014. The petitioner approached the Central
         Information Commission by way of second appeal under <a href="/doc/882307/" id="a_2">section 19(3)</a> of
         the Act.      During the pendency of the appeal before the Central
         Information Commission, a communication dated 13.08.2015 came to be
         addressed to the petitioner from the Commissioner of Income Tax,
         Ahmedabad.
</p>

<p id="p_5">         4.    It is the submission of the petitioner that by way of said
         communication it was given out to him that if the petitioner withdraws
         the second appeal, his request could be considered.                    The petitioner
         withdrew the second appeal. The submission of learned advocate for the
         petitioner is that in the said communication the authority stated that since
         the appeal was pending, they were not able to part with the information.
</p>

<p id="p_6">         5.    On an attentive reading of the said communication dated
         13.08.2015, no such indication much less an assurance is given to the
         petitioner for supply of the information asked for. Nor the communication
         required the petitioner to withdraw the appeal pending before the
         Commission. What is stated by the Commissioner of the Income Tax is
         only that since the matter is sub-judice before the Central Information
         Commision, his office was unable to interfere in the matter. For any
         reason whatever with which the court is not concerned, the petitioner, as
         may have been advised, withdrew his second appeal from the Central
         Information Commission.
</p>

<p id="p_7">         6.    Relying on the said communications, the prayer as aforesaid in the
         present petition is made.       Again, the said communication dated


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                           Page 2 of 4</span>

HC-NIC                                  Page 2 of 4      Created On Sat Apr 02 01:06:18 IST 2016
                    C/SCA/4479/2016                                               ORDER



         29.09.2015 does not contain any direction for furnishing the information.
         Prior to aforesaid communication dated 29.09.2015, one more
         communicated dated 11.06.2015 was issued whereby it was provided to
         consider the request of the assessee and provide copy of the Assessment
         Order as per rules.
</p>

<p id="p_8">         7.    The scenario which emerges from the aforesaid undisputed facts is
         that the application of the petitioner made under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_3">Information
         Act</a> has stood rejected as on date. The second appeal before the Central
         Information Commission came to be withdrawn for whatever reasons
         which weighed with the petitioner. The petitioner relied on letter dated
         29.09.2015 to support his prayer that in the said order, furnishing of the
         information was directed. On seeing the said letter, the communicator
         never stated about the furnishing of the information to the petitioner.
</p>

<p id="p_9">         8.    The weighter reason for not entertaining this petition is that writ
         jurisdiction can not be converted into the jurisdiction to enforce the order
         passed by the information authorities or views exchanged by the
         authorities in inter-se correspondences. In this case there is no positive
         direction to supply the information even. If the petitioner is aggrieved by
         non-supply or incomplete supply of the information, he has a remedy by
         way of filling complaint under <a href="/doc/1210983/" id="a_4">section 18</a> of the Act, or by filing second
         appeal, if the cause of action permits. The petitioner has also a remedy to
         invoke the penal provisions under the Act, if the circumstances and the
         facts so warrant.
</p>

<p id="p_10">         9.    No ground is made out for exercising writ powers. Hence the
         petition is dismissed summarily.</p><pre id="pre_2">
