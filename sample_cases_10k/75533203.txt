              IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA
                       AT CHANDIGARH

                                      C.W.P. No. 15253 of 2012 (O&amp;M)
                                      Date of decision: 9.8.2012


Vijay Kumar Wadhwa
                                                   ..Petitioner

           v.
Life Insurance Corporation of India and others
                                              .. Respondents

CORAM:      HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJESH BINDAL

Present:    Mr. Namit Gautam, Advocate for the petitioner.
                         ...
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Rajesh Bindal J.
</p><p id="p_2">            Challenge in the present petition is to the transfer of the
petitioner from Branch Office, Ferozepur to Satellite Office, Patti.
</p><p id="p_3">            The petitioner is working as Assistant Administrative Officer
with Life Insurance Corporation of India. Earlier the petitioner had filed
C.W.P. No. 11427 of 2012--<a href="/doc/45608156/" id="a_1">Vijay Kumar Wadhwa v. Life Insurance
Corporation of India</a> in this court impugning the aforesaid order of transfer
raising a plea that on account of illness, he may not be transferred to a far
off place. The writ petition was disposed of by this court on 1.6.2012 with a
direction to the respondent therein for consideration of the representation of
the petitioner. The representation of the petitioner was considered and the
same was rejected vide order dated 16.7.2012 mentioning therein that
transfers are general in nature as 36 other officers along with the petitioner
have been transferred. There was allegation of sexual harassment to one Ms.
Paramjit Kaur on 25.11.2011, for which the petitioner had even appeared
before the Women Committee formed at Divisional Office level at Amritsar
on 27.2.2012. It is further noted in the aforesaid order that no medical report
from 2009 onwards was submitted by the petitioner regarding his ill-health.
Though the petitioner was relieved from Branch Office, Ferozepur on
 CWP No. 15253 of 2012                                   [2]

16.1.2012, but till date he has not joined at new place of posting despite
repeated communications to him.
</p><p id="p_4">             Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner
being ill should have been transferred to a place close to Branch Office,
Ferozepur so that his family could be along with him.
</p><p id="p_5">             After hearing learned counsel for the petitioner, I do not find
any merit in the submission made. Transfer is a condition of service. The
petitioner has been transferred from Branch Office, Ferozepur to Satellite
Office, Patti. Mere distance does not matter. It has been mentioned in the
order passed after the earlier writ petition was filed by the petitioner that
from 2009 onwards, the petitioner has not placed before the authorities any
record to show his ill-health.
</p><p id="p_6">             Considering the aforesaid facts, I do not find any merit in the
present petition. Accordingly, the same is dismissed.
</p>
