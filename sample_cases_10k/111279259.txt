     petitioner was Bhumidar/ absolute owner as well as in cultivatory
     possession of his respective share out of above stated acquired
     land    till date of taking over of possession of land by LAC which
     was out of all sort of encumbrances and no litigation regarding the
     said land is pending before any court of law.      It was also stated
     that compensation awarded by LAC in respect of land acquired is


LAC-1027A/15                                             Page:-2/9
      inadequate and is not in accordance with the prevailing market
     value as on the date of notification U/s 4(1) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_2">LA Act</a>. Some
     grounds were also raised in petition wherein it was pleaded that
     LAC has not adopted the correct method of valuation and market
     value of land as assessed is imaginary and without any basis. It
     was further stated that land of petitioner is very fertile and is
     levelled without any kind of depression or defect and land of
     petitioner is fully developed with all modern facilities of like
     telephone, electric connections, water connections, public schools
     and govt. schools, computer institutes, full-fledged post office,
     health gym, modern panchayat ghar and DTC/ private transport.
     It was stated that land of petitioner is surrounded by some other
     colony    being developed around the land of petitioner which are
     situated in the revenue estate of village     Pehladpur,    where the
     market value of the land is more than Rs.10,000/- per sq. yards.
     It was also stated that many people in Delhi have palatial farm
     houses in the close vicinity of the revenue estate of village
     Pehldpur and the cost of land of the farm houses which are in
     Pehladpur      on Delhi-Narela road is not less than Rs.15,000/- per
     sq. yards which is also the increased marketable value of the land
     of the petitioner. It was also stated that LAC has not given any
     compensation for the damages done to the standing crops of
     petitioner at the time of taking possession. Besides that petitioner
     was fully dependent upon the agricultural land which has been
     acquired and after its acquisition the petitioner is left without any
     source    of   income   and   petitioner   should   be   compensated
     adequately for the same which has not been done.                  Hence,
     present reference petition was filed by petitioner.

</p><p id="p_6">   4. In reply to reference petition, the respondent No. 1 Union of India
     had filed written statement wherein preliminary objections were
     raised stating that      Land Acquisition Collector has already
     assessed the market value of the land in question taking into the
     prevailing market rates of the land at the time of notification u/s 4
     of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_3">Land Acquisition Act</a> and various factors were also taken
     into consideration. It was stated that the petitioner is claiming
     excessive and exorbitant market value of the land and structures.
     It was stated that the DLR Act is applicable to the land in dispute
     and petitioner is not entitled for compensation in respect of any
     construction or structure which is raised without the sanction of
     law, however at the time of issuance of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_4">section 4</a> notification there
     were no structures, tree, well on the land in question except
     mentioned in the award and statement under <a href="/doc/1166255/" id="a_5">section 19</a> of Land
     Acquisition Act. It was stated that the land in question is not
     surrounded by any developed or undeveloped colony and can be
     used for agricultural purposes only. It was stated that the Land
     Acquisition Collector rightly assessed the market value of the land
     keeping in view all the aspects enumerated under <a href="/doc/31609/" id="a_6">section 23</a>&amp; <a href="/doc/1485112/" id="a_7">24</a>

     preliminary objections were raised to the effect that amount
     awarded by LAC in the present case is adequate, sufficient, just
     and legal and there is no scope for enhancement of amount of
     compensation. It was also pleaded that present reference petition

      is barred by the period of limitation. It was averred that DLR Act
     was applicable to the land in dispute at the time of notification. On
     merits, it was stated that compensation passed by the LAC is
     legal, adequate, just and fair and same has been awarded by Ld.
     LAC after taking into consideration all the factors relevant for
     determining the compensation and as such petitioner is not
     entitled for grant of enhancement of compensation.          The other
     contents of reference petition were denied and it was prayed that

     and adopted the evidence led on behalf of respondents in leading

     counsel for DDA also adopted the evidence led on behalf of UOI

     enhancement in compensation, if so to what amount?:- The
     onus to prove this issue was on the petitioner. Petitioner has
     contended that valuation of land determined by LAC is not

LAC-1027A/15                                             Page:-5/9
      reasonable as LAC has not adopted the correct method of
     valuation. However, petitioner has not examined any witness to
     support his case for enhancement in compensation, but Ld.
     Counsel for the petitioner has tendered the evidence of Jai Pal
     Singh Vs. UOI LAC No. 180A/09 which was decided by my Ld.
     Predecessor on 11.07.2011. Ld. Counsel for the petitioner argued
     that Jai Pal Singh Vs. UOI (Supra) pertained to the same village,
     same notifications and same award by which the land of the
     present petitioner is acquired. Hence, same market value of
     petitioner's land be determined.
</p><p id="p_15">  11.On perusal of said judgment, I found that Ld. Predecessor had
     determined the market value @ Rs.12,85,628/- per acre. Relevant
     para of the said judgment is reproduced as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                 "Ld. counsel for the petitioner has contended that the

                 residential/commercial purpose and is very closed to
                 the developed area of Rohini Township where DDA has
                 developed residential colony and commercial. He has
                 further contended that from the award itself it is
                 proved that land of village Pehladpur has been
                 acquired for developing Phase IV, V of Rohini
                 Residential Scheme. To prove the location of land Ld.</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">                 Counsel has relied upon testimony of PW2 Sh. Prem
                 Singh, Patwari who has proved Sizra of Village Alipur
                 Ex. PW2/1. PW2 has deposed that petitioner land is
                 situated at a distance of one km from Rohini Sector
                 23,24,25. Delhi Engineering College is at a distance of
                 one or one and half kms and Sanjay Gandhi Transport
                 Nagar at a distance of 2 ½ km and 82 ½ fut vide road
                 from village Samaipur of village Bawana passes
                 through village Samaipur. No cross examination has
                 been done on this respect. Hence, it is proved that
                 petitioner's land has future potential to be used for
                 residential or commercial purpose. But onus was on

LAC-1027A/15                                          Page:-6/9
                the petitioner to prove the potentiality of his land has
               not been considered by LAC. LAC has determined the
               market rate on the basis of Govt. policy dated
               11.09.01 whereby Govt. determined minimum price of
               agricultural land @ Rs. 12.16 lac per acre for period
               01.04.99 to 30.03.2000. Govt. determined minimum
               price of agricultural land on the report of expert
               committee. Therefore, it cannot be said that in the
               absence of any other evidence, adopting the govt.
               policy of minimum price of agricultural land is a wrong
               method. However, I am agree with the contention of
               Ld. Counsel for the petitioner that land rates were
               increasing, which is evident from the Govt. policy Ex.
               PW4/1 to Ex. PW4/8. On perusal of the policy it is
               evident that Govt. vide policy dated 03.05.90 has
               determined the minimum market price of agricultural
               land @ Rs. 4.65 lac per acre from 27.04.90., Rs.10 lac
               per acre from 01.04.97 and Rs.11.20 lac from
               01.04.98 and Rs.12.16 lac for period from 01.04.99
               and Rs.13.82 lac from 01.04.2000. Therefore,
               considering these I am of the view that atleast
               petitioner is entitle to escalation for the intervening
               period from the date when the Government policy
               (become effective till the date of notification u/s 4 of
               the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_8">LA Act</a> i.e. 01.04.1999 to 27.10.99). But what
               should be the percentage of increase for intervening
               period? There are numerous judgment in this regard.
               In Karigowda case (Supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court has
               awarded 15 percent enhancement for intervening
               period between 2 sale deeds. Recently in Chiranji Lal
               Vs. UOI LA Appeal no. 489/2008 decided on
               02.06.2011, Hon'ble Justice Pardeep Nandrajog has
               while relying upon Partap Singh Vs. UOI LA Appeal
               No.193/2006 dated 19.12.08 has observed that till
               year 1996 the increase was 12% and thereafter 10%
               per annum. Considering all these judgment and the
               fact that gap between two notifications is just four
               month, I am of the view that it would be justified to
               give increase @ 10% for the intervening period
               between the date of government policy &amp; notification
               u/s 4 of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_9">LA Act</a> i.e. from 01.04.1999 to 27.10.1999

                1216000+69628 = 1285628). Hence, I determine the
                market value @ Rs.1285628/- per acre thus giving
                enhancement of Rs.69628/- per acre. Besides this
                petitioner should be entitled to 12% additional
                amount u/s 23(1)A and 30% Solatium u/s 23(2) of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_10">LA
