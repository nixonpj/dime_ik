        The High Court Of Madhya Pradesh
                  MCRC-23347-2019
                       (SMT. SUNITRA BAI Vs NEERAJ JAWARIYA)


Jabalpur, Dated : 17-09-2019
      Shri Ashish Sinha, Advocate for the applicant.

      Heard.
      This application has been filed under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. to quash
the order dated 26.10.2018 passed in R.T. No. Unregistered/ 2018 by the
JMFC Sehore (Sunita Goyal) whereby the learned JMFC dismissed the case

for want of prosecution and further restore the proceedings of the same.
      The Facts</pre><p id="p_1"> of the case in short is that the applicant Smt. Sumitra Bai
Asret filed a complaint case against the respondent alleging offences
punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_2">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instrument Act in the Court
of Judicial Magistrate First Class-Sehore. On 26.10.2018 the complaint case
filed by the applicant was fixed for further proceeding, but due to the non
presence of the applicant at the time of hearing learned JMFC dismissed the
complaint case for want of prosecution.
</p><p id="p_2">      Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant was not

aware of the fact that his case was fixed for hearing. So he remained absent
on the date of the hearing because the counsel for the applicant has not
informed her about the date of hearing and due to which the case was
dismissed for want of prosecution without affording opportunity of hearing to
the applicant, the same is objectionable in the eye of law. It is settled principle
of law that for mistake of the counsel the litigant cannot suffer and in the
instant matter the non-appearance of the applicant on the date fixed for
hearing is purely bonafide and only due to no instruction of the engaged
counsel. He prays that this case must be decided on merits.
</p><p id="p_3">      From perusal of the order sheet of trial Court dated 26.10.2018 it is
revealed that trial court has mentioned that the complainant/applicant and her
counsel were not present before the trial Court and also failed to produce her
evidence before the Court. Therefore, the learned trial Court has dismissed
                                              2                       MCRC-23347-2019
    the complaint case and acquitted the accused from the aforesaid charges.
</p><p id="p_4">              Looking to the submissions made by the learned counsel for the
    applicant in the interest of the justice, this M.Cr.C. is allowed, order dated
    26.10.2018 is quashed, the complaint case may is restore to its file for fresh
    adjudication. Subject to depositing Rs. 500/- in the District Legal Aid

    Services Authority, District-Sehore within period of 15 days from the date of
    passing of this order, R.T. No. Unregistered/ 2018 pending in the court of
    JMFC Sehore (Sunita Goyal) be restored to its original number and trial court
    is directed to consider a fresh. It is made clear that if the applicant is failed to
    present before the trial Court then, the learned trial Court shall be free to
    proceed further on its own discretion.
</p><p id="p_5">              Accordingly, M.Cr.C. stands disposed of.
</p><p id="p_6">              Certified copy as per rules.
