              -------------------------------------
          Dated this the 27th day of September, 2012

                          JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      A housing loan of Rs.12,50,000/- was availed of by the

petitioner on 31.03.2009. Payments were not made and bank

submits that the defaulted instalments itself is of Rs.3,55,953/-

and    the   balance    principal  outstanding    is  more     than

Rs.7,70,000/-.    SARFAESI proceedings were initiated by the

bank and finally an order was also obtained from the Chief

Judicial Magistrate Court as provided under Section 14 of the

Act. The Advocate Commissioner appointed by the Court is

scheduled to take over possession of the mortgaged property

today. It is at that stage, this writ petition has been filed with a

prayer to allow the petitioner to discharge the dues in

instalments. Pointing out the facts as above, the bank opposes

the prayer.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. Evidently, from the above, it is clear that the petitioner

is a defaulter. Therefore, the action of the bank in having taken

coercive proceedings, cannot be faulted.

W.P.(C).No.21623/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                : 2 :</span>


</p><p id="p_3">      3. Be that as it may, having regard to the request of the

petitioner to allow him to pay the entire dues in instalments, I

direct that subject to the petitioner paying Rs.2,00,000/- or or

before 04.10.2012, coercive action now initiated will be

deferred. If such payment is made, the balance liability

towards the outstanding dues will also be paid within two

weeks thereafter. If the two instalments are paid as above,

possession of the property will not be taken over. Thereafter,

the balance liability towards the loan in question will be

allowed to be paid in eight equal monthly instalments. The

first instalment will be paid on or before 30.11.2012 and the

subsequent instalments will be paid on or before the 30th of

every succeeding month. It is made clear that in the event of

default of any one of the conditions, the bank will be entitled

to continue the recovery action already initiated.

</p><p id="p_4">      Writ Petition is disposed of as above.
