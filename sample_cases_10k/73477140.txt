       way of delivering products of their foreign

     in India would amount to Export of Services?
</p>
<p id="p_5">(iii) Whether the Hon'ble CESTAT has erred in
      arriving at the view that the services in

      India and the said services were exhausted
      in India after delivery and use in India?
</p>
<p id="p_6">(iv) Whether the Hon'ble CESTAT has erred in
     holding   that    distribution,  promotion,

<p id="p_7">(v)   Whether the Hon'ble CESTAT, Ahmedabad, while
      passing   order    dated   24.11.2014,   has
      correctly considered the income received
      from Ocean Freight Saving as Export of
      Service especially when the said activities
      were carried out in India by unloading the
      vessel faster to save the Ocean Freight
      though the services performed, used and
      exhausted in India?
</p>
<p id="p_8">(vi) Whether the Hon'ble CESTAT, Ahmedabad, while
     passing   order    dated   24.11.2014,   has

     from services provided for Stevedoring,
     Clearing &amp; Forwarding, Customs Clearing,
     Transportation, Supply of Tangible Goods
     etc. as Export of Service especially when

         customers           and when all the services were
         performed,          used and exhausted in India?
</p>
<p id="p_9">(vii) Whether the Export of Service Rules, 2005
      would be applicable in the present case
      where   the   services in  question  were
      performed, delivered, received, used and
      exhausted in India?
</p>
<p id="p_10">(viii)Whether reliance placed on the Board
     Circulars by MIPL could be sustained in the
     facts of the present case ?
