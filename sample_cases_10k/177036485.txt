     them for various destinations on credit. The plaintiff
     firm has been maintaining a regular running account

     Thousand Five Hundred and ninety three only) is due

     of 01.04.2009 to 14.04.2011. Towards the discharge of
     this liability, the defendant No.2 on his own behalf and
     on behalf of defendant No.1 issued a cheque bearing
     no. 000213 dt. 15.05.2011 drawn on Kotak Mahindra

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Suit no. 376/11                                      Page 2 of 5</span>

     Bank, Gurgaon. The said cheque was presented by the
     plaintiff to his banker for encashment but was returned
     back unpaid/dishonoured on the ground of insufficient
     funds vide memo dated 29.03.2011. Aggreived by the
     same plaintiff firm issued legal notice dated 18.04.2011
     to the defendant. However, the defendants have not
     made the payment of the amount due against the
     aforesaid cheques despite service of legal notices.
</p>

<p id="p_3">  3. The plaintiff has claimed the amount due against the
     dishonoured cheque i.e.    Rs.1,86,593/- ( Rupees One
     Lac Eighty Six Thousand Five Hundred and ninety three
     only) alongwith interest at the rate of 24% per annum,

<p id="p_4">  4. Summons for appearance in the proforma prescribed
     under Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
     were served upon the defendants. The defendant
     entered appearance pursuant to service of summons
     for appearance. Thereafter, summons for judgment
     were served upon the defendants. No leave to defend
     application was filed within the prescribed statutory
     period.

<p id="p_5">  5. I have heard the counsel for the plaintiff and have gone
     through the records.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">Suit no. 376/11                                   Page 3 of 5</span>

     and payable by the defendants. Copy of the ledger
     account has been filed. The suit is maintainable under
     Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

     entitled to judgment forthwith under Order XXXVII Rule

     within limitation.
</p>

<p id="p_8">  7. In these facts and circumstances, the plaintiff is
