                   THE petitioners have filed the present
petition being aggrieved by order dated 28.04.2004 passed
by the Member, Board of Revenue, Gwalior in Revision
Case No.493-Two/2004 thereby set-aside the order dated
24.02.2004 passed by the Collector of Stamps, Dewas.
</p><p id="p_4">     [2]           Facts of the case, in short, are as under :-
</p><p id="p_5">           (a)     The    Official       Liquidator,    High         Court
Calcutta in pursuance of an order dated 05.03.2001 passed in
BIFR Case No.126/1991 in the matter of Reliance Ispat
Industries Ltd., issued a sale notice in respect of the
properties of the said industry situated at A.B. Road,
Berakhedi, Dewas and invited tenders in the sealed cover
from the intending purchasers. In response to the aforesaid
sale notice, two parties submitted their offer.                         The

</p>

<p id="p_7">Respondent made highest offer of Rs.10.12 crores to
purchase the entire property of the Reliance Ispat Industries
Ltd. The Hon'ble Company Judge vide order dated
31.08.2001 accepted the bid of the Respondent and dictated
the order in open Court on 31.08.2001. By the aforesaid
order entire immovable and movable properties of the sick
industry - Reliance Ispat Industries Ltd. were sold to the
Respondent in consideration of Rs.10.12 crores. According
to the petitioner in pursuant to the said order, a Sale
Certificate dated 17.11.2003 was issued by the Official
Liquidator, High Court Calcutta and sale-deed dated
25.07.2003 was executed between the Respondent and the
Official Liquidator.
</p><p id="p_8">           (b)   The Respondent presented the sale-deed
before the Registrar for registration who found that the sale-
deed is not adequately stamped as the entire sale
consideration has not been taken into consideration while
affixing the stamps on the sale-deed. The petitioner No.1
impounded the sale-deed under the provisions of <a href="/doc/61287904/" id="a_1">Section 33</a>
of the Indian Stamp Act and referred the matter to the
District Registrar and Collector of Stamps, Dewas vide
reference order dated 06.12.2003. On receiving the aforesaid
reference, the District Registrar and Collector of Stamps,
Dewas initiated the proceedings against the Respondent by
issuing show-cause notice. After receipt of the show-cause
notice, the Respondent submitted a detailed reply on
12.01.2004 by contending that the impugned sale-deed is
only in respect of sale of immovable property worth
Rs.2,85,96,280-00 because the rest of the property worth

</p>

<p id="p_10">Rs.7,26,03,720-00 are movable properties for which he is
not liable to pay stamp duty. During the course of enquiry,
the petitioner No.2 inspected the spot and found that the
plant and machinery are embedded in earth and observed
that the plant is capable of running. The photo copy of the
spot inspection report dated 20.02.2004 is filed as Annexure
P/8. The District Registrar after affording sufficient
opportunity to the Respondent and taking into consideration
the entire material on record passed the order dated
24.02.2004 directing the Respondent to pay the stamp duty
on entire sale consideration i.e. Rs.10.12 crores.                The
petitioner No.2 vide order dated 24.02.2004 directed the
Respondent to pay a sum of Rs.76,26,200-00 towards deficit
stamp duty and penalty.
</p><p id="p_11">           (c)   Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order
dated 24.02.2004, the Respondent preferred an appeal before
the Board of Revenue.         By order dated 28.04.2004, the
Board of Revenue had set-aside the order of Collector on the
ground that the Respondent is liable to pay stamp duty on a
value of the property mentioned in the sale-deed.
</p><p id="p_12">           (d)   Being aggrieved by the order of Board of
Revenue, the State Government had preferred this writ
petition before this Court.
</p><p id="p_13">     [3]         Ms. Nidhi Bohara, learned Deputy Govt.
Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners/State
submitted that the Respondent had purchased the entire
movable and immovable property which constitutes "as is
where is basis" in an auction proceedings conducted by the
High Court of Calcutta in a liquidation proceedings. He

</p>

<p id="p_15">purchased the movable and immovable property of sick
industry in total consideration of Rs.10.12 crores. A sale
certificate in respect of sale of movable and immovable was
issued to the Respondent. Therefore, he is liable to pay the
stamp duty on entire value mentioned in the sale certificate.
The Collector of Stamps has rightly passed the order on the
basis of the inspection report that the plant and machinery
are embedded in earth and the industry is a running industry.
The Respondent cannot be permitted to purchase the entire
plant and machinery without payment of adequate stamp
duty. The Board of Revenue has wrongly interfered with the
order of Collector. Hence, the same is liable to be set-aside.
</p><p id="p_16">       [4]           Shri A.K.Sethi, learned Senior Counsel
appearing on behalf of the Respondent drawn attention of
this Court to the contents of sale-deed and emphasized that
by sale-deed dated 25.07.2003 only immovable property
valued at Rs.2,85,96,280-00 was sold to the Respondent and
not the movable property worth Rs.7,26,03,720-00. The
Board of Revenue has rightly came to the conclusion that the
stamp duty is liable to be paid on the basis of the value of the
property sold by way of registered sale-deed.              Since the
Official Liquidator and the Respondent entered into the sale-
deed    for   sale     of   only   immovable    property          worth
Rs.2,85,96,280-00, the Respondent has rightly paid the
adequate stamp duty. The plant and machinery are not part
of the land being immovable property.             Therefore, the
Respondent is not liable to pay the stamp duty on the value
of the movable property. Hence, no interference is called

<p id="p_18">for.
</p><p id="p_19">       [5]       The facts of the case are not much in
dispute. The High Court of Calcutta on its original side
passed the order dated 31.08.2001 in BIFR Case
No.120/1990 accepting the highest offer of the Respondent
i.e. Rs.10.12 crores and directed to deposit of the entire
purchase price by the Respondent, then the possession of the
property which is being sold will be made ever. The Official
Liquidator was directed to secure the entire purchase money
and thereafter will take steps to issue the sale certificate. In
compliance of the aforesaid order, a Sale Certificate dated
17.11.2003 was issued by the Official Liquidator.                      In
pursuant to the aforesaid order of the High Court, a sale-
deed    dated   25.07.2003    was      executed    between           the
Respondent and the Official Liquidator. In the sale sale-

<p id="p_32">      [9]         It appears that the Official Liquidator had
executed the sale-deed with Respondent on 25.07.2003
much before issuance of the Sale Certificate dated
04.08.2003. When a property was sold by public auction in
pursuance of an order of the Court and the bid was accepted
and the sale was confirmed by the High Court in favour of
the purchaser, the sale becomes absolute and the title vested
in the purchaser only when the sale certificate is issued to
the purchaser. The sale certificate is conveyance of such title
and the auction purchaser derives title on confirmation of
sale in his favour and a sale certificate is issued evidencing
such sale and title.
</p><p id="p_33">      [10]        In the present case the Sale Certificate was
issued for sale of entire industry including movable and
immovable in total consideration of Rs.10.12 crores, but
before its execution a deed of conveyance had been executed
for   sale   of   only    the   land   in   consideration             of
Rs.2,85,96,280-00. But in the Schedule appended to the sale-
deed, the building structures lying thereon has been
mentioned as the property sold. The sale was made "as is
where is basis" by the Court. The sale certificate was issued
