                            Admn</a>.[(1975) 4 SCC 649 : 1975 SCC (Cri) 663 : AIR 1975 SC
                            1960] in which it is observed thus: (SCC p. 651, para 5)
                                   “The High Court in revision was exercising supervisory
                            jurisdiction of a restricted nature and, therefore, it would have
                            been justified in refusing to reappreciate the evidence for the
                            purposes of determining whether the concurrent finding of fact
                            reached by the learned Magistrate and the learned Additional
                            Sessions Judge was correct. But even so, the High Court
                            reviewed the evidence presumably for the purpose of
                            satisfying itself that there was evidence in support of the
                            finding of fact reached by the two subordinate courts and that
                            the finding of fact was not unreasonable or perverse.”



</p><p id="p_37">                            5.   The learned counsel for the accused took this Court

                     through the evidences of Rani (PW1), Malar (PW2) and Suresh

                     (PW4) and submitted that there are discrepancies in their

                     testimonies. He contended that Rani (PW1) has not stated

                     anything about the presence of Malar (PW2) at the time of the

                     incident.

                     and Malar (PW2). Rani (PW1) has stated about the presence of

                     Malar (PW2) at the time of the incident. That apart, just because

                     one witness has not stated anything about the presence of

                     another witness, it will not lead to the inference that the latter

                     witness was not at all present. Unless one witness categorically

                     states that the other witness was not available and the latter

                     witness states that he was available, then, it can be stated that

                     there is contradiction between them.



</p><p id="p_40">                            7. The learned counsel for the accused further took this

                     Court through the cross-examination of Suresh (PW4), who has

                     stated that the deceased has crossed the road from right side to

                     left side and the incident had occurred only on account of that.



</p><p id="p_41">                            8. It is the consistent case of Rani (PW2) and Suresh (PW4)

                     that the deceased Ganesan came to the house of Rani (PW1) as a

                     guest and he was returning to his native with his wife Malar (PW2).

                     Rani (PW1) accompanied him to the bus stand to see him off. The

                     evidence of Suresh (PW4) is not to the effect that the incident had

                     taken place when the deceased was crossing the road from right

                     side to left side. No such suggestion has been put to any of the

                     witnesses. His evidence only shows that the deceased merely

                     crossed the road from right side to left side and nothing more.

                     Based on this solitary statement, it cannot be inferred that the

                     deceased was responsible for the incident.

                     accused was not identified by any witness. The fact remains that

                     the accused himself surrendered before the police immediately

                     after the incident, which conduct is relevant under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_22">Section 8</a> of the

                     Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The nature of injury sustained by the

                     deceased which has been extracted above shows the magnitude of

                     the impact due to collision. He further submitted that the accused

                     also suffered injuries. It is true that after the accused hit the

                     deceased, he lost his balance and fell and that cannot be a good

                     reason to say that he was not driving the vehicle in a rash and

                     negligent manner. He further submitted that the accused had a

                     valid driving licence. Had it been true, the accused would have

                     submitted the same to the Court when he was examined under
