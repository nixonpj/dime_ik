    the date on which the post fell vacant. Mrs.Ansari, learned Advocate for 
                                 
    the Petitioner, has vehemently submitted that since the post fell vacant in 
                                
    2008,   the   qualifications   of   candidates   as   in   2008   alone   should   be 

    considered   and   subsequently   acquired   qualifications   should   not   be 

    considered.

<p id="p_10">    5              She further submits that this case involves peculiar facts. The 





    promotion of Respondent No.4 was disapproved by the Project Officer and 

    Respondent   No.4   could   not   have   been   continued   in   employment, 

    inasmuch   as   he   could   not   have   been   promoted   on   30.11.2010.   She 





    reiterates   her   submissions   that   though   Respondent   No.4   subsequently 

    acquired qualifications of Typing in English and Marathi and MS-CIT prior 

    to November, 2010, these subsequently acquired qualifications are not to 

    be   considered.   The   said   subsequently   acquired   qualifications   are   not 

    entered in the service book of Respondent No.4.

    attention to the qualifications for non-teaching posts in schools prescribed

    that   even   on   the   date   of   his   first   appointment,   Respondent   No.4   was

    applicable. So also, he was actually eligible even in 2009 when he was 
                                 
    appointed for the first time considering the Rules referred to herein above.

           of appointment of Respondent No.4 dated 30.11.2010, the Petitioner as 




                                                                                              
           well as Respondent No.4 were duly qualified. Secondly, the decision of the 

           Management   should   not   be   normally   interfered   with   by   the   School

<p id="p_39">           24                The conclusion of the School Tribunal in paragraph 24 that 

           any decision of the Management in promoting a candidate should not be

           view   is   not   reiterated   by   the   learned   Presiding   Officer   of   the   School 

           Tribunal in future considering the  scope and ambit of Section  9 of the 

           MEPS Act, 1977. However, as far as the conclusions of the School Tribunal 
              
           



           in paragraphs 18 and 19 of the impugned judgment are concerned, same 

           do not deserve to be termed as perverse or erroneous.
