                                   Judgment

18/10/2019

     The petitioner has preferred this writ petition challenging the

transfer order as the Tribunal is not hearing the appeals against

transfers expeditiously and there are lot of appeals pending which

have not been taken up. It is noticed that the Tribunal which has

been formed under the Act of 1976 is obliged to hear the appeals

relating to transfers which are listed before it at the earliest. As

the transfer matters are of urgent nature, they cannot be deferred

for indefinite period.

                                         It has been submitted by learned counsel for petitioner that

                                   transfer has been included as one of the service matters under the

                                   Act of 1976 and therefore, once the person being aggrieved of

                                   his/her transfer files an appeal, the appeal is required to be heard

                                   and order to be passed on his/her appeal. It is, therefore, prayed

                                   that till such order is passed by the Tribunal, he/she should not be

                                   relieved by the Government.

<p id="p_6">                                         Taking into consideration the aforesaid, this court directs the

                                   Tribunal to hear the appeal expeditiously, if required, by even

                                   forming two Benches in this regard and within 10 days of filing of

                                   the appeal. It is further directed that till order is passed on the

                                   appeal of the petitioner, he/she should not be relieved from the

                                   present place of posting.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                                         It is expected that if Tribunal does not take up the matters

                                   within 15 days, the petitioner shall be free to approach this court

                                   afresh.
