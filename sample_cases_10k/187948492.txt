JUDGMENT
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>

</p><p id="p_4">01. Brief facts of the complaint are that complainant filed a

complaint for the alleged offences u/s451/380/427/506 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a> r/w

34/120 B <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a> in which he stated that he and both the accused

are real brothers and in the year 1970-71, he and accused no. 1

jointly purchased the plot of land measuring about 200 square

yards in Behari Colony, i.e, property in dispute of which half

price was paid by accused no. 1 and half by complainant.

Complainant further stated that after purchasing the aforesaid

plot and some time between 1975-80, he got constructed four

rooms on the ground floor over the same with his monetary

funds with the knowledge and consent of accused no. 1 on the

understanding that half possession of constructed portion shall

be given by complainant to accused no. 1 only when he pays

half of its construction price to the complainant. Complainant

further stated that about ten year back, accused no. 2 with his

bag and baggage left Shahjan Pur and requested to him and

accused no. 1 to accommodate him and his family members

somewhere, upon which, complainant and accused no. 1 took
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>

pity and accommodated him and the members of his family in

one room of the house, now in dispute mentioned above.

Complainant further stated that accused no. 2 was also

permitted to open a tea shop for his maintenance and livelihood

by him and accused no. 1 in the house in dispute. Complainant

further stated that one niece of the both parties named Mrs.

Anupama who is a divorce in status, also resides with him in the

aforesaid house who was married about 10/11 years back, but

who got separated from her husband in May-1999 and since

then, she has also been living with her bag and baggage with

him. Complainant further stated that in November 1999, both

accused no. 1 and 2 hatched a criminal conspiracy to

dispossess him from the house in dispute and in furtherance of

this conspiracy, they were finding ways and means how to throw

out him from the premises in suit and how to misappropriate all

chattles and belongings lying in the aforesaid premises of him.

Complainant further stated that it was well within their

knowledge that on 19.11.1999, the marriage of one of nephew
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                4</span>

of the parties named Sanjay Mehra was going to be celebrated

at Fatehpuri (Chandni Chowk), Delhi. Complainant further

stated that he and his niece left their aforesaid premises after

locking them on 19.11.1999 at about 2:00 pm and reached the

place of marriage which was going to be celebrated on

20.11.1999. Complainant further stated that when the functions

of the aforesaid marriage was over on 20.11.1999, he along

with his niece Mrs. Anupama came to the premises in dispute

on 21.11.1999 at or about 6:00 pm when it transpired that the

two rooms which were under the physical possession and his

occupation were criminally trespassed with a view to commit

theft and with a view to cause their demolition by the accused

party-who committed wholesale theft of goods and belongings

to him and his niece and ultimately demolished two pucca

rooms some time between 19.11.1999 to 21.11.1999 during the

period when the complainant and niece were not present in the

aforesaid premises. Complainant further stated that enquiries

made at the spot revealed that all the offences aforesaid were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                5</span>

committed by both the accused party jointly severally along with

some other unknown bad characters. Complainant further

stated that Nawal Kishore, Raj Kumar, Shekhar Mehra, Suraj

and several others have ocularly witnessed all the aforesaid

occurrence committed by the accused persons who apprised

regarding the aforesaid criminal offences to the complainant.

Complainant further stated that when the witness had narrated

regarding the criminal offences in question to him, he

questioned both the accused who were incidentally found

present at that time; upon which both the accused persons

furious, vulgarly abused to him and his niece and threateningly

called upon him to vacate even the remaining third room under

his occupation; otherwise all his goods lying therein would be

destroyed by fire and his niece would be forcibly kidnapped and

he shall also be burnt alive. Complainant further stated that

immediately, the matter was reported to the local police but the

local police has not done anything so far and it has rather

wasted time to make the incident old. Complainant further
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 6</span>

stated that accused party with intent to cause or knowing that it

is likely to cause wrongful loss and damage to him and his niece

caused the destruction of two rooms owned by him valued

approximately in the sum of Rs. 50,000/- and as such, they

have committed the offence of mischief u/s 427 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a>.

Complainant further stated that because the accused party

dishonestly committed the theft of his goods and belongings and

his niece lying in the dwelling house of him without their

consent, hence they are also guilty u/s 380 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>. Complainant

further stated that because the accused party committed house

trespass in order to the committing of the offences punishable

with imprisonment as stated above, hence they are also liable

u/s 451 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a>. Complainant further stated that because all the

aforesaid offences have been committed by the accused party

in furtherance of common intention and as an outcome by the

way of criminal conspiracy hatched by them; hence they are

also liable to the proceeded with u/s 34/120 B <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a>.

Complainant further stated that looking to all the facts and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 7</span>

circumstances of the present case, the criminal activities of the

accused fall within the four corners of <a href="/doc/513777/" id="a_9">section 451</a>/<a href="/doc/839778/" id="a_10">380</a>/<a href="/doc/222396/" id="a_11">427</a>/<a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_12">506</a>

IPC r/w <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_13">section 34</a> and <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_14">120-B</a> IPC for which they are liable to be

summoned, tried and convicted and sentenced as per law.

</p><p id="p_5">02.       After filing of the complaint, my Learned Predecessor

Court called a status report and after hearing upon the status

report, complaint was fixed for pre summoning evidence and

thereafter, both accused were summoned for the alleged

offences u/s 506 (I)/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_15">IPC</a> vide order dated 12.09.2002 and

thereafter, after appearance of both accused, they were admitted

to bail and thereafter, notice of accusation u/s 251 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_16">CrPC</a> was

framed against the accused persons for alleged offences u/s 506

(I)/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_17">IPC</a> on 11.11.2005 to which both accused did not plead

guilty and claimed trial.
</p>
<p id="p_6">03.        In support of his complaint, complainant examined to

himself as CW 1 and Anupama Mehra as CW 2 in post

summoning evidence. CW 1 tendered his evidence by way of

affidavit Ex. CW 1/1 along with documents Ex. CW 1/A to Ex.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                8</span>

CW 1/D in which he deposed on the same line of facts as

mentioned in the complaint, hence same are not reproduced

here. CW 2 Anupama Mehra stated in the course of examination

in chief that on 19.11.1999, she along with complainant went to

attend the marriage of Sanjay Mehra and on 21.11.1999, they

were informed by Shekhar Mehra that two rooms of the property

in question were demolished by the accused persons and entire

goods lying in the property in question were also stolen and

thereafter, matter was reported to the police station and they

also stated to the police that accused persons had used abusive

language for them and they also defamed her regarding her

character.
</p>
<p id="p_7">04.     It is pertinent to mention here that there are two

accused persons namely Murari Lal and Ram Gopal in the

present case but during the pendency of the present case,

accused namely Ram Gopal has been missing from his home,

therefore a missing report has been lodged in the PS Seema

Puri, detailed report has also been called from the SHO of PS
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                 9</span>

Seema Puri in which he stated that aforementioned person

namely Ram Gopal is missing from his home. Publication has

also been done in the newspaper.
</p>
<p id="p_8">05.     Statement of accused namely Murari Lal Malhotra was

recorded on 17.11.2009 in which he stated that the property in

question is in his name and complainant himself vacated the

premises and went away from the property in question. He

further stated that Anupama Mehra did not live permanently in

the property in question and she also left the property in

question. He further stated that he has never given any threat to

the complainant or Anupama Mehra at any time and complainant

has filed false case against him. He further stated that he does

not want to lead his defence evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_9">06.      I have heard Ld. counsels of both parties and perused

the record carefully. During the course of final arguments,

counsel for the complainant stated that complainant Jugal

Kishore examined to himself as CW 1 and also examined to

Anupama Mehra as CW 2 and they both stated in their
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                 10</span>

deposition that accused persons have threatened to the

complainant, therefore, both accused are liable for offence u/s

506 (I)/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_18">IPC</a>. Counsel for the complainant also relied upon

citation, i.e, case titled as Rupak Mudgal &amp; Ors Vs State, 2006

(1) JCC 305, High Court of Delhi, Crl. MC No. 3830 of 2003 in

which it is held that "Criminal intimidation as defined in the

section would imply that threat must be one which can be put

into execution by person threatening-Intention must be to cause

alarm to victim-whether victim was actually alarmed or not is not

material-Threat, by accused of implicating complainant in a

'rape case' brings case within ambit of Sec. 506, Part II, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_19">IPC</a>".

</p><p id="p_10">07.      On the other hand, counsel for the accused stated that

complainant has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable

doubt, hence accused be acquitted for the alleged offences.

Counsel for the accused, in support of arguments for acquittal of

accused, stated that complainant examined three witnesses in

pre summoning evidence who are complainant himself as a CW

1 and other witnesses, i.e, CW 2 Anupama Mehra and CW 3
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                11</span>

Shekhar Mehra. Counsel for the accused further stated that CW

3 Shekhar Mehra was witness of the complainant and it is

stated by the CW 2      Anupama Mehra that witness namely

Shekhar Mehra stated to her and complainant that accused

persons had trespassed in the property and stolen the entire

goods lying therein and demolished the property in question.

But the aforementioned witness has not been called by the

complainant in post summoning evidence for substantiate his

version which creates doubts over the complainant's case.

Moreover, complainant has admitted in the course of cross

examination that the registered documents of the property in

question were executed in the name of accused which shows

that property in question belongs to the accused, then why

accused persons would have given threat to the complainant.

Counsel for the accused further stated that Ld. Predecessor

Court called status report in which it is stated that complainant

has filed false and fabricated complaint after thoughts as

demolition of rooms took place on 19.11.1999 in the presence of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                12</span>

complainant Jugal Kishore himself. Moreover, there was no

luggage in the said room and nothing has been damaged during

the demolition. Moreover, the real dispute was that complainant

is a unmarried persons and he kept a lady namely Anupama

Mehra with him and thereafter, accused persons objected for

keeping the aforesaid lady with him. Counsel for the accused

further stated that complainant claimed that accused persons

had threatened to him with this effect that they would kidnap to

the Anupama Mehra (CW 2) and complainant would be burnt

alive and complainant also claimed that the aforesaid matter

was reported to the police authorities. Counsel for the accused

further stated that during the course of cross examination,

complainant was confronted from his complaint Ex. CW 1/A and

Ex. CW 1/B wherein the aforesaid threats were no where found.

Moreover, CW 2 Anupama Mehra has no where stated in her

post summoning evidence that aforesaid threats were given at

any time to the complainant. However, she only stated that

accused persons abused to them and also defamed to her
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                      13</span>

regarding her character. Counsel for the accused further stated

that since complainant and his witness CW 2 namely Anupama

Mehra have miserably failed to prove that any threats were

given to the complainant and his niece namely Anupama Mehra,

hence accused be acquitted for the alleged offence u/s 506

(I)/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_20">IPC</a>. Counsel for the accused also relied upon citation,

i.e, Noble Mohandass, Petitioner Vs State, Respondent, 1989

CRI.L.J 669 Madras High Court in which it is held that "It should

be real one and not just a mere word when person uttering it

does exact mean what he says and also when person whom

threat is launched does not for threatened actually"

</p><p id="p_11">08.     I have heard Ld. counsels of both parties and perused

the record carefully. After having gone through the rival

submissions of both parties, I find that complainant has failed to

prove its case beyond reasonable doubt on the following

reasons:-
</p>
<p id="p_12">        Firstly,   I   find   that    complainant   examined   three

witnesses in pre summoning evidence. Complainant examined
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                               14</span>

to himself as CW 1 and other witnesses, i.e, CW 2 Anupama

Mehra and CW 3 Shekhar Mehra. I find that CW 3 Shekhar

Mehra was witness of the complainant and it is stated by the

CW 2 Anupama Mehra that witness namely Shekhar Mehra

stated to her and complainant that accused persons had

trespassed in the property and stolen the entire goods lying

therein and demolished the property in question. But the

aforementioned witness has not been called by the complainant

in post summoning evidence for substantiate his version which

creates doubts over the complainant's case. Moreover,

complainant has admitted in the course of cross examination

that the registered documents of the property in question were

executed in the name of accused. However, complainant stated

that property in question was jointly purchased by both

complainant and accused no. 1 but he has not proved that

property in question also belongs to him. During the course of

final arguments, counsel for the accused has also drawn my

attention on the status report called by my Ld. Predecessor
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                               15</span>

Court wherein it is stated that complainant has filed false and

fabricated complaint after thoughts as demolition of rooms took

place on 19.11.1999 in the presence of complainant Jugal

Kishore himself. Moreover, there was no luggage in the said

room and nothing has been damaged during the demolition.

Moreover, the real dispute was that complainant is a unmarried

person and he kept a lady namely Anupama Mehra with him

and thereafter, accused persons objected for keeping the

aforesaid lady with him.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        Now, I examine the evidence of complainant and his

witness. Complainant deposed in the affidavit of evidence Ex.

CW 1/1 that accused persons had threatened to him that they

would kidnap to the Anupama Mehra (CW 2) and complainant

would be burnt alive and complainant also claimed that the

aforesaid matter was reported to the police authorities. It is

pertinent to mention here that during the course of cross

examination, complainant was confronted from his complaint

Ex. CW 1/A and Ex. CW 1/B wherein the aforesaid threats were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                  16</span>

no where found. Moreover, CW 2 Anupama Mehra has no

where stated in her post summoning evidence that aforesaid

threats were given at any time to the complainant. However, she

only stated that accused persons abused to them and also

defamed to her regarding her character.
</p>
<p id="p_14">         After having gone through the evidence of complainant

and his witness CW 2, I find that since complainant and his

witness CW 2 namely Anupama Mehra have miserably failed to

prove that any threats were given to the complainant and his

niece namely Anupama Mehra.
</p>
<p id="p_15">         In keeping view of the aforementioned discussions as

well as ratio of citation relied by counsel for the accused, I am of

the considered view that complainant and his witness have

failed to prove that accused persons criminally intimidated to the

complainant, hence both accused are acquitted for the alleged

offences u/s 506 (I)/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_21">IPC</a>.
