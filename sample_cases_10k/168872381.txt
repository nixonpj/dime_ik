               These petitions have been filed by the petitioner, arising

out of same dispute, therefore, same are being decided by passing a

common order. Petitioners/accused have filed this M.Cr.C. under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. against the orders dated 13.10.2017 and

22.05.2018 whereby the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class has

framed the charge against the petitioners under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">Section 506-II</a> of IPC
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>


                                             M.Cr.C. No. 22191/2018
                                             M.Cr.C. No. 22177/2018

in Criminal Case No. 425/2002 and same was affirmed by the

Sessions Judge, in Criminal Revision No. 49/2017, respectively.

</p><p id="p_2">2.          Case of respondent No.1 in short is that respondent No.

1 filed a criminal complaint under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_3">Section 200</a> of Cr.P.C. against the

petitioner for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Sections 395</a>, <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_5">427</a>, <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_6">454</a>,

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_7">506-B</a> r/w <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_8">Section 149</a> of IPC. Learned Judicial Magistrate inquired

the matter and recorded the statements under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_9">Sections 200</a> and <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_10">202</a>

of Cr.P.C. Further, case was fixed for framing of charges and it was

found that there is a prima facie material available against the

petitioners/accused under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11">Section 506-II</a> of IPC. Thus, charge has

been   framed    under    <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_12">Section   506-II</a>    of   IPC   against    the

petitioners/accused.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.          Respondent/complainant alleged in the complaint that his

house and land are situated at Mahatma Gandhi Ward, Mandla. In

revenue record, same are recorded as plot No. 7 ad-measuring area

155250 sq. foot. Out of above said area, in 2500 Sq.foot, the parental

house of complainant has been constructed whereas in another 2500

sq. Foot, temple and hospice are situated. In rest of the land, small

rental houses have been constructed. Grand father and father of

respondent No.1/complainant were religious persons, influenced from

ancient monastery of Karwadha, due to which they had constructed

hermitage, temple, hospice and mausoleum in their ancestral land.

</p><p id="p_4">4.          It is further contented that petitioner No.1/accused

Prakash Muni is self declared Dharmcharya of Damakheda, Raipur,

who had established his dominion in several monasteries. Father of

                                               M.Cr.C. No. 22191/2018
                                               M.Cr.C. No. 22177/2018

complainant has ratified him. On 23.09.2008, when complainant's

father has expired, petitioners/accused alongwith his thousand

followers came to house to attend funeral ceremony of complainant's

father and they started to throw domestic articles of his house and

threatened him for life to vacate the house. Thereafter, complainant

informed the police station, during this period accused persons had

forcefully fired family member out from the house. Thereafter,

respondent/complainant filed a criminal complaint in cognizance was

taken by the Court under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_13">Section 506-II</a> of IPC.

</p><p id="p_5">5.           Learned counsel for the petitioner/accused submits that

the learned trial Court has examined 13 witnesses under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_14">Sections 200</a>

and <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_15">202</a> of the Cr.P.C. thereafter, took cognizance only for the offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_16">Section 506-II</a> of IPC.         Before framing charge,

statements of four witnesses have also been recorded by the Court,

and   they   were    cross-examined       by   the   petitioners/accused.

Complainant has exhibited five documents vide annexure D-1 to D-5.

On the basis of written complaint vide Ex. D-1, police inquired into

the matter and Town Inspector, Kotwali Mandla has submitted his

report to the SP, Mandla, concluding that the respondent No. 1 has

submitted a false report and it is he, who wanted to take possession of

the Math. To restrain him, it was done.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.           He further submits that it is evident that incident is said

to have taken place on 2.10.2008. A civil suit as annexure P-27 was

filed by the complainant in respect to same land against the

Bhuvneshawar Das Mahant on 16.10.2008. Their application for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        4</span>


                                               M.Cr.C. No. 22191/2018
                                                M.Cr.C. No. 22177/2018

granting temporary injunction was rejected on 19.12.2008 which is

annexed as P-28. The present complaint as annexure P-8 was filed on

04.08.2010, after passing two years of the incident, perhaps in order

to put pressure upon the petitioners to come to a settlement with the

petitioner in the civil suit. The delay in filing the complaint is in itself

sufficient to hold that the complaint is false, fabricated and filed with

malafide intention and same amounts to abuse of process of law.

</p><p id="p_7">7.           Further, the evidence recorded before framing of charges

does not at all make out any prima facie case against any of the

petitioners under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_17">Section 506-II</a> of IPC. The evidence of witnesses

shows that there is no prima facie material is available against the

petitioners/accused, which basis charge could be framed, Therefore,

impugned order are based without any evidence, so learned counsel

for the petitioners prays for quashing the complaint as well as charge.

</p><p id="p_8">8.           Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents opposes

the submission made by learned counsel for the petitioners and

submits that there is prima facie material is available on the record,

thus, complaint and charge can not be quashed. He prays for

dismissal of the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.           Heard both the parties and perused the case.

</p><p id="p_10">10.          Before embarking on the facts of the case, it would be

appropriate to consider the legal aspect first. The provision regarding

discharge is provided under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_18">Section 245</a> of Cr.P.C., same is quoted as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "245. When accused shall be discharged.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       5</span>


<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                               M.Cr.C. No. 22191/2018
                                               M.Cr.C. No. 22177/2018

            (1) If, upon taking all the evidence referred to in
            section 244, the Magistrate considers, for reasons to
            be recorded, that no case against the accused has been
            made out which, if unrebutted, would warrant his
            conviction, the Magistrate shall discharge him.
            (2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent a
            Magistrate from discharging the accused at any
            previous stage of the case if, for reasons to be recorded
            by such magistrate, he considers the charge to be
            groundless"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">11.         The scope for framing of charges is described by the

Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Tamil Nadu by Inspector

of Police Vigilance and Anti Corruption Vs. N. Suresh Rajan and

Others reported in (2014) 11 SCC 709. It is held as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">            "31. Now reverting to the decisions of this Court in
            the case Sajjan Kumar (supra) and Dilawar Balu
            Kurane (supra), relied on by the respondents, we are
            of the opinion that they do not advance their case. The
            aforesaid decisions consider the provision of Section
            227 of the Code and make it clear that at the stage of
            discharge the Court can not make a roving enquiry
            into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the
            evidence as if it was conducting a trial. It is worth
            mentioning that the Code contemplates discharge of
            the accused by the Court of Sessions under Section
            227 in a case triable by it; cases instituted upon a
            police report are covered by Section 239 and cases
            instituted otherwise than on a police report are dealt
            with in Section 245. From a reading of the aforesaid
            sections it is evident that they contain somewhat
            different provisions with regard to discharge of an
            accused.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">            31.1. Under Section 227 of the Code, the trial court is
            required to discharge the accused if it "considers that
            there is not sufficient ground for proceeding against
            the accused". However, discharge under Section 239
            can be ordered when "the Magistrate considers the
            charge against the accused to be groundless". The
            power to discharge is exercisable under Section 245(1)
            when, "the Magistrate considers, for reasons to be
            recorded that no case against the accused has been
            made out which, if not repudiated, would warrant his
            conviction".</blockquote><p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">            31.2. <a href="/doc/470297/" id="a_19">Section 227</a> and <a href="/doc/1572967/" id="a_20">239</a> provide for discharge
            before the recording of evidence on the basis of the
            police report, the documents sent along with it and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                           6</span>


                                   M.Cr.C. No. 22191/2018
                                    M.Cr.C. No. 22177/2018

examination of the accused after giving an opportunity
to the parties to be heard. However, the stage of
discharge under <a href="/doc/901796/" id="a_21">Section 245</a>, on the other hand, is
reached only after the evidence referred in <a href="/doc/1842242/" id="a_22">Section 244</a>
has been taken.
</p>
<p id="p_14">31.3. Thus, there is difference in the language
employed in these provisions. But, in our opinion,
notwithstanding these differences, and whichever
provision may be applicable, the court is required at
this stage to see that there is a prima facie case for
proceeding against the accused. Reference in this
connection can be made to a judgment of this Court in
the case of R.S. Nayak v. A.R. Antulay, (1986) 2 SCC
</p><p id="p_15">716. The same reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_16">"43..................Notwithstanding this difference in the
position there is no scope for doubt that the stage at
which the magistrate is required to consider the
question of framing of charge under <a href="/doc/901796/" id="a_23">Section 245(1)</a> is
a preliminary one and the test of "prima facie" case
has to be applied. In spite of the difference in the
language of the three sections, the legal position is that
if the Trial court is satisfied that a prima facie case is
made out, charge has to be framed."
</p>
<p id="p_17">32. Bearing in mind the principles aforesaid, we
proceed to consider the facts of the present case.

32.1. Here the allegation against the accused Minister
(Respondent No.1), K. Ponmudi is that while he was a
Member of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly and a
State Minister, he had acquired and was in possession
of the properties in the name of his wife as also his
mother-in-law, who along with his other friends, were
of Siga Educational Trust, Villupuram. According to
the prosecution, the properties of Siga Educational
Trust, Villupuram were held by other accused on
behalf of the accused Minister. These properties,
according to the prosecution, in fact, were the
properties of K.Ponumudi.
</p>
<p id="p_18">32.2. Similarly, accused N. Suresh Rajan has acquired
properties disproportionate to his known sources of
income in the names of his father and mother.

32.3. While passing the order of discharge, the fact
that the accused other than the two Ministers have
been assessed to income tax and paid income tax
cannot be relied upon to discharge the accused
persons particularly in view of the allegation made by
the prosecution that there was no separate income to
amass such huge properties. The property in the name
of an income tax assessee itself cannot be a ground to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       7</span>


                                               M.Cr.C. No. 22191/2018
                                                M.Cr.C. No. 22177/2018

            hold that it actually belongs to such an assessee. In
            case this proposition is accepted, in our opinion, it will
            lead to disastrous consequences. It will give
            opportunity to the corrupt public servants to amass
            property in the name of known persons, pay income tax
            on their behalf and then be out from the mischief of
            law.
</p>
<p id="p_19">            32.4. While passing the impugned orders, the court
            has not sifted the materials for the purpose of finding
            out whether or not there is sufficient ground for
            proceeding against the accused but whether that would
            warrant a conviction. We are of the opinion that this
            was not the stage where the court should have
            appraised the evidence and discharged the accused as
            if it was passing an order of acquittal. Further, defect
            in investigation itself cannot be a ground for
            discharge. In our opinion, the order impugned suffers
            from grave error and calls for rectification.

</p><p id="p_20">            33. Any observation made by us in this judgment is for
            the purpose of disposal of these appeals and shall have
            no bearing on the trial. The surviving respondents are
            directed to appear before the respective courts on 3rd
            of February, 2014. The Court shall proceed with the
            trial from the stage of charge in accordance with law

<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">12.         So it is evident from aforesaid Section and case law that

the charge can only be framed on perusal of the prima facie material.

</p><p id="p_23">13.         It is evident from the complaint vide Ex. P-8, there is a

dispute between the parties about the plot No.7 ad measuring area

155250 sq. foot at situated Mahatama Gandhi ward, Mandla. It is also

evident that house, temple, mausoleum and hospice are situated over

the said land. Complainant deposed before the trial Court that his

residence is at Mahatma Gandhi Ward Mandla, where house, temple

and other rooms are situated. The premises is called as Mahantwada

and Kabeerwada. His grandfather Late Bhajan Das and his father-

Tankar Das were Kabeer Panthi Mahant, they have received Mahanti

Panja. Respondent/complainant filed a Civil Suit No. 148/2008 for

the same property which was dismissed. Petitioner-Prakash Muni is

Acharya of Kabeer Panthi Sant. He was also head of asharm of

Kabeer Panthi situated at Damakheda. He had conducted all the

proceeding from Damakheda in respect to the different places in

which asharms of Kabeer Panthi sant are situated. Therefore, Kabeer

Panthi Ashram situated at Gandhi ward, Mandla, is also governed by

petitioner/accused Prakash Muni from Damakheda. It is not disputed

that the father of complainant/respondent No.2 Tankar Das was

Mahant of Kabeer Bada Asharm, Mandla.. After the death of Mahant,

to attend his last rites ceremony (Choka), petitioner-Prakash Muni

and others came to Mandla. Condolence message card was published

by Mahant Bhuvneshawar Das. Petitioner-Prakash Muni told that this

place is for Sadhu and Muni, so leave the place, otherwise he would

kill him. Same facts of evidence ware given by other witnesses, so

prima facie it is evident that petitioner/accused Prakash Muni is

Kabeer Panti and interest of Kabeer Panties is also attached to the

disputed land. As it is already evident that the father of complainant

was a Mahant and after his death, other Mahant took over the charge

of disputed property. So it is clear that there is a dispute about

property. The alleged incident occurred on 02.10.2008 after that

complainant filed a civil suit, which was dismissed. After passing of

two years of incident, Complainant filed a criminal complaint which

clearly shows that the same was instituted after thought. Apart from

that respondent/complainant filed a complaint on 03.10.2008, before

the Collector and Superintendent of police, Mandla, but it is not

mentioned in the complaint that the petitioners/accused were present

at the time of incident,   the names of petitioners/accused except

Prakash Muni were not mentioned. Presence of petitioner/accused

Prakash Muni was also not mentioned in the complaint. It is

mentioned in the complaint that volunteers of petitioner/accused

Prakash Muni threatened him, though, no specific act and presence of

petitioners/accused mentioned in this complaint. Complainant

admitted this fact that he knew the petitioners/accused before this

incident, but he did not mention the name of any petitioners/accused

in his complaint vide Ex. D-1, so it is crystal clear that if any of

petitioners/accused threatened him and complainant lodged a

complaint then there is no reason for not mentioning any name so

also act of petitioner in his complaint. Kamlesh Dubey (PW-2) is son-

in-law of complainant Chandra Prakash (PW-1) admitted this fact that

petitioner No. 5 /accused Mahant Mandhari Das lived with Mahant

Tankardas at the Ashram and Mahant Tankardas used to worship

God.
</p>
<p id="p_24">14.          Kaleem Khan (PW-3) admitted this fact in examination

conducted before framing the charges that petitioner No. 5/accused

Mandhari Das was worshipping god after the death of Mahant

Tankardas.

<p id="p_25">15.          Purnima Sharma (PW-4) wife of Chandra Kishor Sharma

(PW-1) admitted this fact that she is giving evidence after studying

the case and taking advise from her advocate.

</p><p id="p_27">16.                     Therefore, it is evident from forgoing discussion, there is

property dispute and ownership of disputed property is alleged to be

of Kabeer Panthies. Complainant/respondent alleged that dispute

property is his ancestral property. He has also filed a civil suit but

same was dismissed. Respondent filed a complaint soon after the

incident as Ex. D-1, but he has not mentioned the name of

petitioners/accused and their presence at the time of incident. After

passing of two years of incident, he has filed this criminal complaint.

Therefore, it is clear, there is no case against petitioners/accused,

thus, interference is required in the impugned order.
