                 ORAL ORDER</pre>

<p id="p_1">5   24-06-2014                The petitioner, in the present writ application, seeks a

                 direction to the respondents for payment of his full salary from the

                 month of October, 2002 till date; after adjusting the basic salary

                 which has been paid to him from February, 2010 onwards.

</p><p id="p_2">                              The facts for adjudication of the present matter are

                 short.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                              The petitioner, on the strength of an advertisement

                 published on 14th and 17th September, 1989 for the post of Non-

                 Medical Assistant, had applied and after undergoing a process of

                 selection was appointed on 23.12.1989 on the said post.

                 Subsequently, on 21.02.1994 a show cause notice was issued to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Patna High Court CWJC No.19640 of 2011 (5) dt.24-06-2014</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          2/5</span>


             him asking him to explain as to why his appointment be not

             cancelled, having not been made by the competent authority. It is

             the case of the petitioner that the petitioner continued to work and

             suddenly respondents stopped making payment of salary from

             May, 2000 on the ground of enquiry into genuineness of his

             appointment. In the year 2002, again a show cause notice was

             issued relating to illegality of the petitioner's appointment by a

             person not competent to appoint. It appears that, subsequently, the

             service of the petitioner was terminated along with others. The

             petitioner and others came to this court challenging the order of

             termination by filing CWJC No. 13967 of 2002. The writ petition

             was heard and disposed of by a common order dated 08.09.2003

             along with CWJC No. 4702 of 2003. Letters Patent Appeals were

             preferred against the said order dated 08.09.2003 passed in various

             writ applications. This court by a common order disposed of all

             such appeals, with the consent of the parties, to reconsider the

             cases of the affected employees in the light of judgement of the

             Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/104090797/" id="a_1">State of Karnataka vs. Uma Devi</a>,

             (2006) 4 SCC 1.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                           It has been pleaded on behalf of the petitioner that a

             five men committee was constituted pursuant to the order of this

             court in a batch of Letters Patent Appeals and the committee found

             the appointment of the petitioner to be illegal. The petitioner,

             thereafter, approached this court by filing CWJC No. 4872/2009
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Patna High Court CWJC No.19640 of 2011 (5) dt.24-06-2014</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                          3/5</span>


             challenging the report of the committee. This court by an order

             dated 18.04.2009 passed in CWJC No. 4872/2009 quashed the

             report of the committee to the extent it related to the petitioner

             with a direction for his reinstatement. This court also observed, in

             view of the facts and circumstances, that the petitioner could not

             have been treated as illegal appointee, but an irregular appointee in

             terms of the report of the committee and he was, therefore, fully

             entitled to the benefit of the observations made by the Division

             Bench. The court further held that if it was an irregular

             appointment and the respondents did not wish to regularize him,

             they were bound to proceed against those who appointed the

             petitioner irregularly and simultaneously, the court observed that if

             the petitioner had to go, such persons appointing him must also go.

</p><p id="p_5">                           In the background of these facts, the relief sought for in

             the present application is that the petitioner should be paid arrears

             of salary during which he remained out of service because of the

             impugned action of the respondents. Further plea is that in the

             light of order of this court passed in CWJC No. 4872/2009 dated

             18.04.2009, the petitioner had submitted his joining on 24.04.2009

             and he was subsequently posted vide an order dated 25.08.2010

             and since then he is working without any interruption.

</p><p id="p_6">                           Mr. Shivendra Kishore, learned senior counsel

             appearing on behalf of the petitioner, has contended that though

             the petitioner is discharging his duties regularly after submission
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> Patna High Court CWJC No.19640 of 2011 (5) dt.24-06-2014</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                          4/5</span>


             of his joining pursuant to order of this court dated 18.04.2009, the

             respondents are paying to the petitioner only basic salary without

             giving him benefit of any increment or dearness allowance. He

             submits that this is being done in the name of an enquiry which is

             said to be still going on, in terms of the order of this court dated

             18.04.2009.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                           So far as the petitioner's plea that he should be granted

             full back wages for the period during which he remained out of

             service, I am of the opinion that such plea was available to him

             while pursuing his writ application, i.e., CWJC No. 4872/2009.

             This court while allowing the said writ application by an order

             dated 18.04.2009 directed the petitioner to be reinstated but did

             not direct for any consequential benefits in terms of payment of

             back wages etc. In my opinion, such relief of the petitioner for

             payment of back wages is barred by the doctrine of constructive

             res judicata. As regards the petitioner's claim for payment of his

             full salary in accordance with law from the date of his submission

             and acceptance of joining pursuant to the order dated 18.04.2009, I

             find force in the submission made on behalf of the petitioner and I

             find no justification and reasoning as to why respondents can

             withhold a part of the salary which the petitioner is entitled to for

             the work he is discharging. The respondents are, accordingly,

             directed to pay to the petitioner the entire arrears of salary from

             the date of his submission and acceptance of joining pursuant to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">         Patna High Court CWJC No.19640 of 2011 (5) dt.24-06-2014</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                  5/5</span>


                     the order dated 18.04.2009 passed by this court in CWJC No.

                     4872/2009. Such arrears must be paid within a period of three

                     months from the date of receipt/ production of a copy of this order.

                     It is made clear that if persons similarly situated to the petitioner,

                     are paid backwages by the Respondents in any situation, they will

                     be required to consider petitioner's case also and in that case the

                     petitioner must be given equal treatment and should not be

                     discriminated against.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                                   Mr. Shivendra Kishore, learned senior counsel

                     appearing on behalf of the petitioner, has pointed out that if in

                     spite of petitioner's appointment having found to be regular, the

                     respondents are indented to proceed, they were obliged to take

                     action against the persons who appointed the petitioner though

                     they did not have any authority to do so. Mr. Shivendra Kishore

                     appears to be right in his submission. If the respondents proceed

                     any further, as regards the validity of petitioner's appointment,

                     they will be obliged to proceed against the persons who appointed

                     him, in the light of the order of this court dated 18.04.2009.

</p><p id="p_9">                                   This writ application is allowed accordingly.
