Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Punjab Vs. Balbir Singh reported in AIR

1994 SC 1872 that

             "The scope of these two sections (<a href="/doc/1137396/" id="a_9">section 100</a> and <a href="/doc/996365/" id="a_10">165</a> of Code of

Criminal Procedure) have been examined in a number of cases. <a href="/doc/984748/" id="a_11">In Wasan Singh

v. State</a> (1981) 2 SCC this Court has clearly held that irregularity in a search

cannot vitiate the seizure of the articles. <a href="/doc/1919512/" id="a_12">In Suder Singh v. State of Uttar

Pradesh</a>, AIR 1956 SC 411, it is held that irregularity cannot vitiate the trial

unless the accused has been prejudiced by the defect and it is also held that if

reliable local witnesses are not available the search would not be vitiated. <a href="/doc/1061342/" id="a_13">In

State of Maharashtra v. P.K. Pathak</a>, AIR SC 1224, it is held that absence of

any independent from the locality to witness the search does not affect the trial

and the conviction of the accused under the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_14">Customs Act</a>. <a href="/doc/402211/" id="a_15">In Radha Kishan v.

State of Uttar Pradesh</a>, 1963 SC 822, it is held that irregularity in a search

would , however, cast a duty upon the Court to scrutinise the evidence regarding

the search very carefully. <a href="/doc/701977/" id="a_16">In Matajog Dubey v. H.C. Bahri</a>, AIR 1956 SC 44 it

is held that when the salutary provisions have not been complied with, it may,

however, affect the weight of the evidence in support of the search or may furnish

a reason for disbelieving the evidence produced by the prosecution unless the

prosecution properly explains such circumstance which made it impossible for it

to comply with these provisions.......

lack of time and opportunity to associate some independent witnesses with

the search and strictly comply with these provisions."

</p><p id="p_19">16.        There is no reason to doubt the testimony of PWs merely because

they are police personnel. It has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

Karamjit Singh Vs. State (Delhi Administration) reported in AIR 2003 SC

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">1311</span>

           "........The testimony of police personnel should be treated in the

same manner as testimony of any other witness and there is no principle of

law that without corroboration by independent witnesses their testimony

cannot be relied upon. The presumption that a person acts honestly applies

as much in favour of police personnel as of other persons and it is not a

proper judicial approach to distrust and suspect them without good

grounds. It will all depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case

and no principle of general application can be laid down....."

</p><p id="p_20">17.         In the light of the said judgement, the testimony of PWs cannot be

discarded merely on the ground that they are police personnel. Constable

Krishan Kumar who has accompanying constable Shamsher has not been

examined. However, his non examination is not fatal. PW-2 and PW-4 have

supported and corroborated the version of each other by giving a similar

account of the incident. Their unimpeached testimony cannot be discarded

merely because of non examination of constable Krishan Kumar.
