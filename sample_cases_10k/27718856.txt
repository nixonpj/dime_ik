(BY SRI.C.S.PATIL, GOVT.ADVOCATE FOR R1,
    SRI.RAMESH N.MISALE, ADV. FOR R2 AND R3)

      THESE APPEALS ARE FILED UNDER SECTION 4 OF
KARNATAKA HIGH COURT ACT, 1961, PRAYING THIS HON'BLE
COURT TO CALL FOR RECORDS AND SET ASIDE THE
IMPUGNED ORDER DATED 28.02.2017 IN WRIT PETITION
NOS.103366-103367/2016 (LA-RES) AND ALLOW THE WRIT
PETITIONS BY ALLOWING THESE WRIT APPEALS.

     THESE APPEALS COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING THIS DAY, A.S.BOPANNA J., DELIVERED THE
FOLLOWING:

                                JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       The learned Government Advocate to accept notice

for respondent No.1, Sri.Ramesh N.Misale, learned

counsel to accept notice for respondent Nos.2 and 3.

They        are     permitted      to     file    their    memo      of

appearance/vakalath in four weeks.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">       2.         The   appellants       are     before   this   Court

assailing         the   order    dated    28.02.2017      passed     in

W.P.Nos.103366-103367/2016.                    The   learned     Single

Judge by order dated 28.02.2017 has dismissed the writ
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    :3:</span>


petitions      filed   by    the   appellants.    The   appellants

therefore, claiming to be aggrieved are before this Court

in these appeals.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">       3.       The learned counsel for the appellants while

assailing the order passed by the learned Single Judge

would contend that the learned Single Judge ought to

have        directed   the    respondents    to    consider   the

representation, which had been filed by the petitioners,

since the petitioners in the said representation have

sought certain rights with regard to the compensation

for the first floor portion of the building. To buttress his

contention, the learned counsel would refer to the

communication dated 23.03.2014 said to have been

issued by Neeravari Nigam Niyamith. Further, the

learned counsel would refer to the order passed by the

learned Single Judge in W.P.No.75265/2013 dated

17.01.2013, wherein a similarly placed land looser had

sought consideration of the representation, which had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                           :4:</span>


been directed by this Court in favour of the petitioner

and therefore, a similar direction to consider the

representation submitted by the petitioners herein was

required to be made. In that view, it is contended that

the learned Single Judge without taking note of these

aspects has declined the relief to the appellants, which

would not be justified.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">     4.    The learned Government Advocate and the

learned counsel representing respondent Nos.2 and 3

would however seek to sustain the order passed by the

learned Single Judge. It is pointed out that the

respondents had filed their objections statement to the

writ petitions, wherein the very same claim that had

been put forth in the representation was adverted to

and the right as claimed by the petitioners therein,

namely, the appellants herein was denied and therefore,

consideration of the representation in any event would

not arise. Hence, it is contended that the learned Single
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   :5:</span>


Judge     was    justified       in   the   conclusion   reached

ultimately.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">     5.       In the light of what is submitted before us,

we have perused the appeal papers. On perusal of the

records, it is no doubt seen that the learned Single

Judge of this Court in earlier writ petitions referred to

above     had   issued       a    direction   to   consider   the

representation that had been filed by the petitioners

therein. It is in that view, on referring to such order the

appellants herein filed a memo before the learned Single

Judge seeking disposal of the writ petitions on similar

terms. Though that is the position, there is nothing on

record to indicate that in the said writ petitions referred

to, a stand had been taken by the respondents before

the learned Single Judge with regard to the grievance

that had been put forth in the representation and to

contend that it would not arise for consideration.

Hence, an innocuous direction to consider was issued.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            :6:</span>


</p><p id="p_10">     6.      On the other hand, in the instant case,

through the objections filed to the writ petitions, the

respondents had categorically denied the existence of

first floor portion in the building as claimed by the

petitioners and had thus sought to resist the claim as

put forth by the petitioners to seek compensation.      If

that be the position, a direction to consider the

representation in any event would not arise, as it would

only result in an empty formality of the respondents

once again rejecting the representation made by the

petitioners for the same reasons stated in the objection

statement.     When the stand of the respondents is

already made known in the writ petitions nothing more

is required to be made. Therefore, to the said extent, the

learned Single Judge was justified in not directing

consideration of the representation.


</p><p id="p_11">     7.      However, on taking note of the contentions

that is put forth by the learned counsel for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                            :7:</span>


appellants and also the claim that is made with regard

to further compensation being sought relating to the

building said to have existed in the acquired property,

certainly, the appellants, if they have any right, the

other remedy in accordance with law, can be availed

notwithstanding the rejection of the petitions, insofar as

consideration of the representation. In that view,

without expressing any opinion on the merits of the

claim as made by the appellants, since we do not see

any reason to interfere with the order passed by the

learned Single Judge for the reasons as stated above,

these appeals stand disposed of.
