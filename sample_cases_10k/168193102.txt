      These writ petitions are filed under Articles 226 and
227 of the constitution of India praying to direct the R-3
and R-4 to take appropriate and necessary steps and
register the absolute sale deeds in favour of the petitioners
of their respective sites which are allotted in favour of the
petitioners.

     These writ petitions coming on for preliminary
hearing this day, the court made the following:

                         ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     Smt. Pramodhini Kishan, the learned High Court

Government Pleader is directed to take notice for the

respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.    The    petitioners'       grievance   is     that    the

respondents are not registering the sale deeds in their

favour, despite allotting the sites to them. The petitioners

claim to be the grantees of the sites, as they belong to

weaker sections of society.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">     3.    Sri B.S.Hadimani, the learned counsel for the

petitioners submits that      the petitioners         are   all the

recipients of the beneficial scheme of the Government and

that they are allotted the sites. Further, the third

respondent-the Special Tahsildar even issued the notice to

the petitioners to appear before the jurisdictional registrar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  8</span>



on 12.06.2012 and 06.06.2012 for getting the sale deeds

registered.    In this regard, he refers to the notice, dated

05.06.2012 (Annexures - B2 to B27).        He submits that the

fourth      respondent   -   Tahsildar   has   been   given   the

authorization to complete the registration formalities.

</p><p id="p_6">       4.     Smt. Pramodhini Kishan submits that the

petitioners' cases would be considered in accordance with

law.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       5.     On hearing the learned advocates, I dispose of

these petitions with a direction to the respondents to

consider the petitioners' request for the registration of the

sale deeds in respect of the sites allotted to them, if any, in

accordance with law, as expeditiously as possible and in

any case within an outer limit of three months from the

date of the issuance of the certified copy of today's order. It

is made clear that no opinion whatsoever is expressed

on the merits of the claims of the petitioners. If it is

found that they are not eligible to get the sites registered in

their names, the concerned authorities shall issue the

necessary endorsement without any loss of time.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             9</span>



</p><p id="p_8">     6.    These petitions are accordingly disposed of. No

orders as to costs.
