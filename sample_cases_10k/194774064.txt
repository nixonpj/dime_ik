SI Prahlad Singh and PW-16 Insp. Dig Vijay Singh, the prosecution has been
successful in proving on record the guilt of the accused persons beyond the
reasonable doubt. It is further submitted that prosecution has been successful in
proving on record that all the four accused - Musharaf Hussain @ Sagar, Shamshad
Alam, Mohd. Sabir @ Raju and Mohd. Javed @ Rahim entered into a criminal
conspiracy to commit the murder of Razia Khatoon @ Deepa @ Dipika and in
pursuance of the aforesaid conspiracy, they committed the murder of Razia Khatoon
@ Deepa and after committing the murder of Razia Khatoon @ Deepa, accused
Mohd. Sabir @ Raju and Shamshad Alam, set the dead body of deceased on fire
after pouring petrol over her dead body with the intention to cause disappearance
of evidence of commission of aforesaid offence of murder and accused Musharaf
Hussain informed the police that Razia Khatoon @ Deepa died on account of
accidental fire due to burst of gas cylinder with intention to screen himself and his
co-accused from legal punishment. Ld Addl. PP also submitted that in view of

successful in proving the guilt of the accused persons beyond the reasonable doubt

offences.
</p><p id="p_24">            On the other hand, it has been submitted by the Ld. defence counsels that
the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the accused persons
beyond the reasonable doubts. It is further submitted that accused persons were
innocent and have been falsely implicated in this case although they have nothing
to do with the commission of offences in the present case. It is also submitted that
the prosecution has failed to complete the chain of circumstances to connect the
accused persons with the offences in the instant case and has failed to prove the

guilt of the accused persons on record beyond the reasonable doubt. Ld. defence
counsels submitted that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove on record
that accused persons committed the murder of the deceased or that they were in
any way connected with the offence alleged in this case. It is further submitted
that there were material contradictions and discrepancies in the testimonies of
various prosecution witnesses and these contradictions and discrepancies were fatal
to the case of the prosecution. It is also submitted that the entire case of prosecution
is based upon statements allegedly made by Sonu &amp; Monu nephews of accused
Mushrraf , however said Sonu and Monu have not been cited or examined as
witnesses in this case and the said fact is also fatal to the case of the prosecution.
Ld. defence counsels submitted that testimonies of various prosecution witnesses
lack credibility and as such their testimonies can not be relied upon to prove the
case against the accused persons. It is further submitted that accused Mushrraf was
carrying out construction of the first floor of his house , when Beat Constable
namely Badan Singh came to him and demanded a sum of Rs.25,000/- which the
accused refused and on this, the said constable took accused Mushrraf with him to
P.S Bindapur on the pretext of having talk with Sr. Police Officials and at P.S
Bindapur Insp. Dig Vijay Singh told the accused that every one pay at the time of
carrying construction and he should also pay and when accused refused, his
construction work was stopped by the police . It is further submitted that thereafter
the incident took place at the house of accused Mushrraf and Insp. Dig Vijay
Singh demanded a sum of Rs. 5 lacs from him which the said accused could not pay
and as such accused-Mushrraf was illegally confined and during said illegal
confinement, police obtained his signatures on various blank papers/formats
forcibly and falsely implicated him in this case. Ld. defence counsel submitted that


Sessions Case No. 81/08                                                           11/26

accused Shamshad was also innocent and IO lifted him on 22.02.2008 in the night
and took him to P .S alongwith one Bunty and demanded Rs.50,000/- from him
and when he refused , he was merciless beaten and tortured by the IO . It is further
submitted that IO took money from Sonu, Monu and Bunty and set them free and
as accused Shamshad could not pay the amount he was falsely implicated in this
case. Ld. defence counsel submitted that accused Mohd. Sabir was also innocent
and his signatures were obtained by the police on blank papers/formats forcibly
which were later on manipulated as his disclosure statement and memos and on the
basis of the said fabricated documents, accused Mohd. Sabir was falsely implicated
in this case. It is further submitted that accused Mohd. Javed was also lifted by the
police and was kept in illegal custody and thereafter he was falsely implicated in
this case , although he had nothing to do with the offences alleged in the present
case. Ld. defence counsels also submitted that the prosecution has miserably
failed to bring home the guilt against the accused persons and they prayed that all
the four accused persons may be acquitted of the charged offences.

(reported as (2008) 8 SCC 456)", it has been laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India that :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          " It has been consistently laid down by this Court that
          where a case rests squarely on circumstantial evidence, the
          inference of guilt can be justified only when all the
          incriminating facts and circumstances are found to be
          incompatible with the innocence of the accused or the guilt
          of any other person. The circumstances from which an
          inference as to the guilt of the accused is drawn have to be
          proved beyond reasonable doubt and have to be shown to
          be closely connected with the principal fact sought to be

          to negative the innocence of the accused and bring home
          the offences beyond any reasonable doubt".</blockquote>

          circumstantial evidence the best evidence must be adduced
          which the nature of the case admits; (4) in order to justify

<p id="p_33">            In view of the above law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India, it is clear that in order to convict the accused persons on the basis of the
circumstantial evidence, it is essential that the circumstances from which the
inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be cogently and firmly established on
record by the prosecution and those circumstances should be of a definite tendency,
unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused and the circumstances, taken
cumulatively should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the
conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the
accused and none else.

Singh &amp; PW-6 SI Prahlad Singh, both of whom accompanied him during the course
of investigation. In addition to that, PW-16 deposed that on 28.02.2008, he
alongwith members of investigating team and all four accused persons went near
the place of occurrence and inquired from the public persons and they disclosed that
in the said locality usually there was a power cut between 7:00 to 8:00 P.M and on


Sessions Case No. 81/08                                                       19/26

the day of incident they had not seen any person visiting the H. No. C-1/23 Pratap
Garden nor had they seen anyone coming out from the said house but none of the
public persons were ready to give their statement. Thereafter, he called SI Mahesh
Kumar, Draftsman from crime branch and on his pointing out, he took the
measurements and rough notes of the spot and later on he handed over him
scaled site plan which was Ex. PW-10/A. He further deposed that on 13.05.2008,
the exhibits of the present case were sent to FSL, Rohini through Ct. Satyapal in
sealed condition and thereafter, he completed the investigation, charge sheet was
prepared by the SHO and presented in the court. PW-16 deposed that during the
course of trial of this case, he received the FSL result and filed the same in the court
and the FSL reports were Ex. PW-13/A, Ex. PW-13/B and Ex. PW-14/A.

<p id="p_39">11.         In the instant case, in order to prove its case on record, the prosecution
is mainly relying upon the circumstantial evidence i.e recovery of weapon of
offence i.e knife and plastic cane used for carrying petrol. The said recoveries were
allegedly got effected by accused Mohd. Sabir and Shamshad. Further, the
prosecution is also relying upon the recovery of the various jewelery and other
articles of deceased which were effected from or at the instance of accused -
Mohd. Javed @ Rahim, Mohd. Sabir and Shamshad. In addition to this, the
prosecution is also relying upon the alleged recovery of amount of Rs. 3000/-, got
recovered by accused Shamshad and a sum of Rs. 200/- got recovered by accused
Rahim and it is alleged that the said amount was given by accused Mushrraf as
advance for the commission of offence.
</p><p id="p_40">            In order to prove the aforesaid incriminating circumstances on record,
the prosecution is primarily relying upon the testimonies of PW-5 ASI Zile Singh,


Sessions Case No. 81/08                                                           20/26

PW-6 SI Prahlad Singh and PW-16 Insp. Dig Vijay Singh, however as far as the
testimonies of the said witnesses i.e PW-5, PW-6 &amp; PW-16 are concerned, their
testimonies do not inspire confidence as there are material contradictions/
discrepancies in their testimonies and these contradictions/discrepancies are fatal to
the case of the prosecution. In addition to this, in the instant case, from the evidence
of PW-5, PW-6 &amp; PW-16 , it is clear that no efforts were made by them to join
any public witness at the time of recording of disclosure or recovery of aforesaid
articles from the respective accused persons . In fact, in his cross examination PW-
16 Insp. Dig Vijay Singh specifically admitted that he did not comply with the
provisions of section -100 (4) Cr. PC at the time of recoveries effected from the
accused persons. In these circumstances, in view of the the non compliance of the
relevant provisions of <a href="/doc/714464/" id="a_12">section 100</a> (4) Cr. PC, the alleged recovery from the accused
persons itself becomes doubtful.
</p><p id="p_41">               In the case titled as "Prithvipal Singh @ Munna Vs. State ( reported
as 2001 (1) RCR (Crl.) 482)" it has been laid down by the Hon'ble High Court of
Delhi that :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">           " Section 43 of the Act read alongwith sub-section (4) of
           <a href="/doc/1137396/" id="a_13">Section 100</a> Cr. P.C contemplates that search should, as
           far as practicable, be made in the presence of two
           independent and respectable witnesses of the locality and if
           the designated officer fails to do so the onus would be on
           the prosecution to establish that the association of such
           witnesses was not possible on the facts and circumstances
           of a particular case. The stringent minimum punishment
           prescribed by the Act clearly renders such a course
           imperative. Thus, the statutory desirability in the matter of
           search and seizure is that there should be two or more
           independent and respectable witnesses. The search before
           an independent two or more independent would impart

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                          22</span>

           much more authenticity and creditworthiness to the search
           and seizure proceedings. It would also verily strengthen
           the prosecution case. The said safe- guard is also intended
           to avoid criticism of arbitrary and high-handed action
           against authorized officer".</blockquote>


<p id="p_42">            In view of the above and having regard to the material on record, it is
clear that provisions of section 100 Cr. PC have not been complied by the IO
before effecting the alleged recovery from the accused persons in the instant
case and this in itself make the recovery from the accused persons doubtful. In
addition to this, no public or independent witness was joined at the time of
alleged recovery of weapon of offence i.e knife at the instance of accused persons
and this again makes the recovery of weapon of offence doubtful as has been laid
by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in the case cited as 1998 (1) JCC ( Delhi)
173 .
</p><p id="p_43">            In the aforesaid case titled as "Dinesh Kumar Vs. State ( cited as
1998 (1) JCC ( Delhi) 173 )", it has been laid down by the Hon'ble High Court of
Delhi that :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">          " It need hardly be said that in order to lend assurance that
          the investigation has been proceeding in fair and honest

          least not free from doubt. The object of Sub-section (4) of

          things to be " round " in searches."</blockquote>



<p id="p_44">            In addition to the above, no public or independent witness was even
joined at the time of recovery of articles of the deceased allegedly got effected by
the accused persons and this again makes the recovery of the said articles doubtful
as has been laid by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case cited as 1997
IX AD SC 361.
</p><p id="p_45">            In the aforesaid case titled as " State of Punjab Vs. Sarup Singh
(cited as 1997 IX AD SC 361)", it has been laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India that :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">          " After going through the evidence what we find is that
          the recovery of money and the wrist watch stated to be of
          the deceased were recovered by the investigating Officer
          in presence of Amar Singh PW-10 Maternal grandfather
          of the deceased. Thus , the recovery was not in presence
          of any independent person. It was for this reason that the
          High Court did not think it safe to place any reliance on
          the recovery evidence."</blockquote>
<p id="p_46">            In the instant case,   the alleged recovery was effected only in the
presence of the police officials and even the relatives of the deceased or any other
independent person were not present at that time , which makes the alleged
recovery all the more doubtful . Further, it is pertinent to note that in the present
case , the incident had taken place on 19.2.2008 and the aforesaid alleged recovery
have been effected from the accused persons on 27.2.2008 and this again makes
the recovery doubtful as it is highly improbable that a person who had received the
articles pertaining to the deceased would keep the said articles in his possession.
In such circumstances, the normal human conduct would have been to dispose of

Sessions Case No. 81/08                                                         23/26
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                           24</span>

the said articles at the first available opportunity and by no stretch of imagination,
it can be expected that the accused persons will keep the said articles with them so
as to   facilitate the investigating/prosecuting agency to connect them with the
commission of offence in this case. Even otherwise, no evidence whatsoever have
brought on record to prove that the articles of the deceased allegedly got recovered
by the accused persons in fact belonged to the deceased and this fact again is fatal
to the case of the prosecution.
</p>

<p id="p_47">12.         In the present case, the perusal of the record reveals that the case has
been worked out by the investigating agency on the basis of the statements/
disclosure made by Sonu &amp; Monu , nephews of accused Mushrraf , however said
Sonu &amp; Monu have not been cited or examined as witnesses in this case for the
reasons best known to the prosecution and non citing or non-examination of the
aforesaid material witnesses is also fatal to the case of the prosecution in view of
the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case cited as AIR
1971 SC 1586.
</p><p id="p_48">            In the aforesaid case titled as "State of U.P Vs. Jaggo @ Jagdish and
Ors. ( cited as AIR 1971 SC 1586 )", it has been laid down by the Hon'ble

           witness whose evidence is essential to the unfolding of the
           narrative must be called. His absence seriously affects the
           truth of the prosecution case".</blockquote>


<p id="p_49">            Further, during the investigation of the case, the mobile phones of the
accused persons were seized by the IO, but call details regarding the usage of the


Sessions Case No. 81/08                                                          24/26
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                           25</span>

said mobile phones have not been placed on record by the IO , although the said
call details might have been relevant for the purpose of bringing out the truth in this
case as these call details would have proved the presence of the accused persons at
the relevant time as well as their inter-action          with each other. In these
circumstances, non filing of the said relevant call details on record creates serious
doubts in the case of the prosecution. In fact, it has not been explained on record as
to what was the purpose of seizure of the aforesaid mobile phones, when the call
details qua them were not to be placed on record and in the absence thereof, it is
difficult to understand as to why the said mobile phones were seized by the IO
during the investigation of the case .
</p><p id="p_50">            In addition to the above, the material public witness i.e PW-1 Muzahid
Ali also resiled from his earlier statement and does not support the case of the
prosecution and was cross -examined by the Ld. Addl. PP for the State. In his cross
examination by the Ld. Addl. PP, PW-1 denied that when he went to the first floor
he found gas cylinder lying in the kitchen in intact condition or that he had stated
that fire was not caused due to gas cylinder. He further denied that at that time he
came to know that the girl who died was a Hindu girl and her name was Deepa
or that deceased girl was not related to Musharaf Hussain or that she was got
murdered by accused Musharaf Hussain. PW-1 also denied the suggestion that he
was deposing falsely, being won over by the accused in order to save the accused.
</p>

<p id="p_51">13.         In the present case, there is no direct evidence and prosecution is mainly
relying upon the circumstantial evidence to prove its case on record. It is well
settled that in order to convict the accused persons on the basis of the circumstantial
evidence, it is essential for the prosecution to firmly establish the circumstances on


Sessions Case No. 81/08                                                          25/26

record, from which the inference of guilt is sought to be drawn and those
circumstances should be of definite tendency, unerringly pointing towards guilt of
the accused and the circumstances, taken cumulatively should form a chain so
complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human
probability the crime was committed by the accused and none else, however, in the
instant case, the prosecution has failed to establish on record any such chain of
circumstances, which unerringly points towards the guilt of the accused persons or
which could lead to the conclusion that within all human probability, the crime
was committed by the accused persons or that they caused disappearance or
destruction of evidence of commission of offences alleged in the present case.
</p>


<p id="p_52">14.          Thus, in view of the above discussion and observations and having
regard to the fact and circumstances of the present case, I am of the considered
opinion that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the accused persons on
record, beyond the reasonable doubts. Accordingly, I acquit all the four accused-
Musharaf Hussain @ Sagar, Shamshad Alam, Mohd. Sabir @ Raju and Mohd.
Javed @ Rahim of the charged offences, giving them the benefit of doubt.
