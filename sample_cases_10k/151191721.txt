HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD, LUCKNOW BENCH
 
 

?Court No. - 23
 

 
Case :- SERVICE SINGLE No. - 25406 of 2019
 

 
Petitioner :- Abdul Wahab
 
Respondent :- State Of U.P. Thru Prin.Secy. Irrigation Lko. &amp; Ors.
 
Counsel for Petitioner :- Shailendra Kumar Dubey
 
Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C.
 

 
Hon'ble Rajesh Singh Chauhan,J.
</pre> 
<p id="p_1">Heard Sri Shailendra Kumar Dubey, learned counsel for the petitioner. Notices for the opposite parties have been accepted by the office of learned CSC.
</p> 
<p id="p_2">By means of this petition, the petitioner has assailed the validity of the order dated 6.2.2019 passed by opposite party no.5 rejecting the claim of the petitioner whereby the petitioner had prayed that his entire services be counted, which have been rendered as muster roll/ work charged establishment for providing pensionery benefits and thereby the petitioner be paid pensionery benefits treating him as a regular employee.
</p> 
<p id="p_3">The case set forth by the learned counsel for the petitioner is that while rejecting the aforesaid claim of the petitioner, the opposite party has referred the fact that since the issue in question is pending before the Hon'ble Apex Court and the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in re; Habib Khan Vs. State of Uttarakhand &amp; Ors, Civil Appeal No.10806 of 2017, is not applicable for the employees of the State of U.P., therefore, no decision can be taken in favour of the petitioner. The petitioner was appointed as work charged employee on 1.2.1980 on the post of Nalkoop Chaukidar in the office of Executive Engineer, Nalkoop Khand, Gonda and his services were regularized on 15/16.2.2005 in the office of Executive Engineer, Saryu Nahar, Khand-8, Bahraich on the post of Seech Pal. However, after his retirement in the year 2011, more precisely on 30.4.2011, from the post of Seech Pal, the services rendered by the petitioner as work charged employee upto 16.2.2005 have not been counted, resultant thereof the petitioner has been deprived from pensionery and retiral benefits.
</p> 
<p id="p_4">It has been noted that the Full Bench of this Court had decided the controversy in favour of the work charged employees, however the issue went in special leave petition before the Hon'ble Apex Court and the Hon'ble Apex Court finally decided the issue on 2.9.2019 in Civil Appeal No.6798 of 2019, <a href="/doc/120921569/" id="a_1">Prem Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Ors. Para-36</a> of the aforesaid judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in re; Prem Singh (supra) is being reproduced herein below:-
</p> 
<p id="p_5">"36. In view of reading down Rule 3(8) of the U.P. Retirement Benefits Rules, 1961, we hold that services rendered in the work-charged establishment shall be treated as qualifying service under the aforesaid rule for grant of pension. The arrears of pension shall be confined to three years only before the date of the order. Let the admissible benefits be paid accordingly within three months. Resultantly, the appeals filed by the employees are allowed and filed by the State aredismissed." 
</p> 
<p id="p_6">Since the present issue is now no more res integra in view of the dictum of the Hon'ble Apex Court dated 2.9.2019 in re; Prem Singh (supra), I hereby set aside the order dated 6.2.2019 passed by opposite party no.5, which is contained in Annexure No.1 to the writ petition and the opposite parties are directed to pass a fresh order in conformity with the dictum of the Hon'ble Apex Court dated 2.9.2019 in re; Prem Singh (supra), with expedition, preferably within a period of two months from the date of production of certified copy of the order of this Court. 
</p> 
<p id="p_7">The writ petition is accordingly disposed of. 
</p> 
<p id="p_8">Order Date :- 17.9.2019
