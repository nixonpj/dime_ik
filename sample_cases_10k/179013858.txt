</p><p id="p_7"> 3.                On  1st  December,  1998,  the  petitioner  was  appointed   on  the

 post of Assistant Teacher in the school run by the respondent society.   In

 February, 2009, he was promoted as Headmaster of the school. While he

 worked as Headmaster, an order of suspension was issued against him by the

 Vice President of the first respondent society purportedly under a resolution

 passed by the managing committee of the society for a disciplinary action

 against   him.   On   12th  April,   2011,   respondent   No.4,   in   his   capacity   as

 Secretary of respondent No.1 society, issued a charge-sheet and statement of

 allegations   to   the   petitioner,   calling   for   his   explanation.   The   petitioner

 objected   to   the   disciplinary   enquiry   on   the   ground   that   the   enquiry   was

 neither initiated by the President of the society nor was the President called

 for   conducting   the   enquiry   and   accordingly,   the   enquiry   was   not   in

 accordance   with   the   provisions   of   the   Maharashtra   Employees   of   Private

 Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Act, 1977 (hereinafter referred to

 as "MEPS Act" for brevity) and the Rules framed thereunder. The petitioner,

 accordingly,   submitted   a   communication   to   the   Enquiry   Committee.     The

 petitioner,   in   the   meantime,   challenged   his   suspension   order   by   filing   a

 petition before this Court, being Writ Petition No.552 of 2011. On 11 th April,

 2011, that petition was withdrawn. Thereafter the petitioner filed another

 petition,   being   Writ   Petition   No.   2664   of   2011,   seeking  inter   alia  a

 declaration that initiation of departmental enquiry against him by respondent

 No.4   was   illegal   and   the   petitioner   be   allowed   to   resume   in   the   post   of

 Headmaster.     Even   this   writ   petition   was   withdrawn   by   him   later.     The

 enquiry against the petitioner thereafter proceeded,   and resulted into the

 dismissal order passed against him.  Being aggrieved, the petitioner filed an

 appeal, being Appeal No.18 of 2013, before the school Tribunal at Amravati.

 The   School   Tribunal,   by   a   detailed   order   and   judgment,   rejected   the

 petitioner's appeal.  Being aggrieved, the petitioner has preferred the present

 writ petition.

</p><p id="p_10"> 4.                One of the principal contentions of the petitioner urged before

 the School Tribunal, and also pressed before this Court by  learned counsel

 for the petitioner, is that the initiation of the departmental enquiry against

 the petitioner was vitiated due to violation of the provisions of the MEPS Act

 and the Rules.   Learned counsel submits that since the petitioner was the

 Headmaster of the school, disciplinary proceedings against him could have

 been initiated only by the President of the trust and not by either respondent

 No.3 (the then Vice-President who passed the initial suspension order) or

 respondent No.4 (the Secretary who purportedly issued the chargesheet and

 statement   of   allegations,   calling   for   the   petitioner's   explanation   and

 proposing   the   disciplinary   enquiry).       Learned   counsel   submits   that   the

 President alone is not only empowered to initiate the enquiry, but is also

 required   to   be   part   of   the   enquiry   committee   in   accordance   with   the

 applicable provisions of the Act and the Rules.  Learned counsel submits that

 the petitioner is merely a victim of the internal fight between  two groups in

 the management,  respondent No.2 who was the President of the Trust being

 on one side and the other committee members including respondent Nos. 3

 and 4 being on the other.  The School Tribunal, in its impugned order, has

 noted that it was an admitted fact that on 6 th February, 2011, i.e. before the

 disciplinary proceedings against the petitioner were initiated by service of the

 charge-sheet, there were elections to the managing committee of the trust, in

 which   respondent   No.3   was   elected   as   President   in   place   of   the   earlier

 President,   i.e.   respondent   No.2,   and   respondent   No.4   was   appointed   as

 Secretary.    The petitioner did not dispute the factum of the elections.  It was

 indeed not his case that after the expiry of the term of management of the

 the earlier management headed by respondent No.2, respondent Nos. 3 and

 4 took over the management without conducting elections.  The main thrust

 of   the   petitioner's   arguments       before   the   School   Tribunal   was   that   the

 validity   of   the   elections   and   appointment   of   respondent   Nos.   3   and   4,

 respectively, in the posts of the President and the Secretary, was the subject

 matter of a pending enquiry before the Charity Commissioner and pending

 acceptance of the change report in that behalf, respondent Nos. 3 and 4 were

 not entitled to conduct the management or issue, in particular, any show

 cause   notice   or   disciplinary   action   against   the   petitioner.     The   School

 Tribunal, relying on the judgment of our Court in the case of Vijay K. Mehta

 Vs. Charu K. Mehta, reported in 2008(5) ALL MR 366, held that pendency of

 the change report in respect of the existing management of the trust would

 not in any way help the petitioner in resisting the enquiry.  It is not really in

 dispute   that   the   term   of   the   old   management   under   the   Presidentship   of

 respondent No.2 had come to an end by February, 2011 and that elections to

 the managing committee were held on 6 th February, 2011.  In these elections,

 respondent   No.3   was   elected   as   President   in   place   of   respondent   No.2.

 Though   the   change   report   in   that   behalf   was   pending   before   the   Charity

 Commissioner, that is to say, there was no order of acceptance of the change

 under Section 22(3) of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, there is no restriction

 in law insofar as management of the trust by the newly elected management



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">::: Uploaded on - 15/09/2017                              ::: Downloaded on - 17/09/2017 01:56:58 :::</span>
  Judgment                                              6                                wp1236.15.odt




 is concerned.   The changes effected by the trust in its management are in

 pursuance of the elections of 6th February, 2011 and take effect immediately.

 Acceptance   of   change   report   by   the   Charity   Commissioner   merely   gives

 finality to the change already effected by the trust.   It is not that the act of

 making of such change comes into effect from the date of acceptance of the

 change report.  This was laid down by a learned single Judge of our Court in

 the case of <a href="/doc/1650221/" id="a_1">Chembur Trombay Education vs. D.K. Marathe</a> [2002(3) BCR 161]

 and endorsed by a Division Bench of this Court in the case of  <a href="/doc/130808000/" id="a_2">Ganesh vs.

 C.H.M.Edu</a>. Society, reported in  2007(6) Mh.L.J.589.   It is   this law which

 was   reiterated   by   our   Court   when   it   decided   the   case   of  Vijay   K.   Mehta

 (supra).   The School Tribunal correctly applied this law to the facts of the

 present case and held that a mere dispute between the management or a

 pending contest concerning a change in management or acceptance of the

 change effected by the trust in its management did not in any way prohibit

 the new management from managing the trust and in particular, as part of

 that management, from taking disciplinary action against the employees of

 the   school   including   the   petitioner   herein.   The   School   Tribunal   rightly

 observed   that   the   petitioner   was   an   employee   of   the   school;   he   was   not

 expected to get into the dispute between the trustees; as an employee he had

 to face the inquiry as per the procedure.   
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12"> 5.                Learned counsel for the petitioner relies on a judgment of the

 Supreme Court in the case of Nand Deo Pande vs. Committees of Management



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">::: Uploaded on - 15/09/2017                               ::: Downloaded on - 17/09/2017 01:56:58 :::</span>
  Judgment                                              7                                wp1236.15.odt




 and other, reported in AIR 1991 SC 413.  That was a case where the enquiry

 was instituted against the head of the school and the argument before the

 Court   was   that   the   enquiry   was   not   initiated   by   a   validly   constituted

 managing   committee.   The   Court   held   that   the   delinquent   employee   was

 entitled   to   urge   that   the   committee   initiating   action   against   him   was   not

 validly constituted  or had ceased  to  be validly constituted.   The Supreme

 Court in that case noticed that the issue of validity of the committee was

 being decided by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate Deputy Director of Education.

 The SDM/ DDE was directed to proceed with the enquiry and complete the

 same within one month and thereafter the committee held to be properly

 constituted   would   be   at   liberty   to   continue   with   the   proceedings   of   the

 enquiry against the petitioner and, in the meantime, the enquiry initiated by

 the present committee of management would stand stayed.  It is pertinent to

 note that in the case before the Supreme Court, the District Inspector acting

 under   U.P.   Intermediate   Education   Act,   1921   had   already   found   that   the

 managing committee of the school had ceased to be valid due to non-renewal

 of the registration of the society and non-holding of periodical elections and

 it was this dispute, which was pending before the Sub-Divisional Magistrate

 under   the   provisions   of   the   Societies   Registration   (U.P.   Amendment)   Act,

 1960.  In fact, in the light of this position, the District Inspector had declined

 to grant approval to the suspension order passed by the School Management

 against the petitioner.  Similar enquiry was also pending before the Deputy

 Director of Education  under the U.P. Education Act.    The directions of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">::: Uploaded on - 15/09/2017                               ::: Downloaded on - 17/09/2017 01:56:58 :::</span>
  Judgment                                             8                                wp1236.15.odt




 Supreme  Court   referred   to   above  were  passed   in   the  light   of   these   facts.

 These facts are clearly distinguishable from the facts of our case, where the

 elections to the managing committee were actually held and respondent Nos.

 3 and 4 were, respectively, elected as President and Secretary of the trust in

 place   of   the   earlier   incumbents.   What   was   pending   before   the   Charity

 Authorities   was   a  change   report   in   respect   of   these   changes,   which   were

 contested by the earlier incumbents including respondent No.2 herein.  The

 facts of our case are clearly covered by the decisions  of our Court referred to

 above.  
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14"> 6.                Learned counsel for the petitioner also submits that there is no

 compliance with the provisions of the MEPS Act and the Rules insofar as the

 conduct of the disciplinary enquiry in the present case is concerned.  Learned

 counsel submits that the petitioner was merely given a charge-sheet and not

 a statement of allegations as is mandatory under the provisions of the MEPS

 Act and the Rules.  There is no merit even in this contention.  As observed by

 the   School   Tribunal,   though   the   provisions   of   the   Rules   do   indicate   that

 charge-sheet and statement of allegations communicated to the delinquent

 are separate documents,   in the facts of the present case, there might not be

 much difference between the nature of the two documents.   If     whatever

 submitted to the petitioner as part of the charge-sheet is not merely charges

 per se but also allegations on the basis of which these charges were proposed,

 it more or less substantially meets the requirement of law.  Our Court in the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">::: Uploaded on - 15/09/2017                              ::: Downloaded on - 17/09/2017 01:56:58 :::</span>
  Judgment                                              9                                wp1236.15.odt




 case of  Sulochana Daulatrao Thakare Vs. Sangam Shikshan Sanstha &amp; oth.,

 reported in  2004(4) Bom.C.R.488,  has held that mere technical objection

 such as some variation in the schedule will not avail the delinquent against

 whom disciplinary action has been duly taken. What we have to see in all

 these   cases   is   whether   the   principles   of   natural   justice   have   been

 substantially complied with before the delinquent is punished.   One has to

 see   whether   he   had   a   reasonable   and   adequate   opportunity   to   meet   the

 charges and to defend himself  in the enquiry.  If we have regard to the facts

 of our case, the petitioner cannot be said to have been in any way prejudiced

 by non-communication of charges and statement of allegations separately.  In

 fact, the petitioner never participated in the enquiry. He doggedly refused to

 participate on the ground that the enquiry committee itself was not properly

 constituted.  If that was his case and not that he was  denied any opportunity

 to show cause as such, the fact that the charge-sheet and the statement of

 allegations were not separately communicated to him, would scarcely make

 any  difference.    Whether these  were  submitted  separately  or together,   he

 never meant to show cause to the charges or allegations purportedly on the

 ground indicated above.  Indeed, in keeping with this approach of his, both

 his appeal before the School Tribunal and his petition to this Court are silent

 on this particular aspect.  There is no whisper either in the appeal or in the

 petition   that   the   petitioner   was   denied   any   effective   opportunity   to   show
