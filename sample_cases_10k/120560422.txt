<p id="p_11">2.          Learned        counsel     for    the        parties   state     that   the

controversy is covered by the judgment rendered by a coordinate

Bench of this Court in Mukesh Kumar Tailor Vs. State of

Rajasthan (S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.750/2017, decided on

09.02.2017, the judgment reads as under :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">     "All the abovementioned writ petitions shall stand
     disposed of by this common order as the issue involved
     is identical.</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">                            (3 of 6)
                                                        [CW-2553/2018]

The facts in short are that the respondent-Zila Parishad
issued   the   advertisement       dated   24.02.2012     for
recruitment to the post of Teacher Grade III-2012. The
selections made in pursuance to the said advertisement
were challenged before this Court. Subsequently, the
Division Bench of this Court vide judgment and order
dated 08.12.2014 passed in Manju Choudhary &amp; ors. Vs.
State of Rajasthan &amp; ors. (DB Civil Special Appeal (Writ)
No.35/2014)), while partly allowing the Special Appeals
passed the following directions:
</p>
<p id="p_13">   "We do not find any error of law and agree with the
   reasoning given by learned Single Judge in
   Ramdhan Kumawat V/s The State of Rajasthan &amp;
   anr. (supra), pursuant to which the results have to
   be 14 revised after fresh evaluation of answers.
   The revision of select list is thus not complete and
   the process is still open. In the circumstances, in
   order to allay any apprehension and to protect the
   interest of the appellants-petitioners, who were
   appointed, and are under constant threat on the
   revision of lists under directions of the Court,
   without any fault attributed to them, we find it
   appropriate to quash the order dated 30.8.2013
   passed by the Secretary and Commissioner,
   Gramin Vikas and Panchayati Raj Department
   (Panchayati Raj Primary Education), Government
   of Rajasthan, Jaipur, to the extent that it directs
   termination of services of those persons, who were
   ousted from selections on the declaration of the
   first revised results. We direct that at this stage,
   they will not be ousted from service. The
   termination orders passed, if any, consequent to
   the orders dated 30.8.2013, are set aside. The
   directions given by learned Single Judge in
   Ramdhan Kumawat V/s The State of Rajasthan &amp;
   anr. (supra), namely, that the Expert Committee
   will issue model answer keys afresh and that the
   results will be revised in accordance with such
   keys, will be given effect to, leaving the question of
   its correctness open. The State Government will be
   at liberty to pass fresh orders, after revising the
   results and adjusting equities protecting the
   interest of the appellants-petitioners, to the extent
   that they will not be ousted from the select list and
                                 (4 of 6)
                                                         [CW-2553/2018]

   will be placed as far as possible at the bottom of
   the revised select list."
</p><p id="p_14">As a result, all those candidates whose names appeared
in the revised list were granted appointment and those
who had already stood selected, continued to remain in
service in spite of the fact that their names no more
figured in the revised list. The outfall is that there were
many candidates whose names were not in merit in the
first list but as per the revised result got more marks
than those who were allowed to continue in service by
the order of the High Court even though, they now had
less marks than the petitioners. The Special Leave
Petition   against   the       judgment    and   order   dated
08.12.2014 was also dismissed. Thus, as on date, all
those candidates who had got less marks than the
petitioners are continuing to be retained in service and
the same has resulted in filing of number of writ
petitions by candidates who now have more marks as
per the revised result. Thus, the grievance of the
petitioners is that in pursuance to the same selection,
the candidates less meritorious to the petitioners are
continuing in service, whereas, as per the revised result,
the petitioners have got more marks than those who are
retained in service by the order of the Court. In short,
those who had got less marks than the petitioners are
still continuing in service.
</p>
<p id="p_15">The matter having been settled uptill Hon'ble Supreme
Court, the candidates who were appointed in pursuance
to the first list shall have to be permitted to continue.
The respondent- State taking into account the grievance
of the petitioners have tried to workout the possibility to
adjust as many as candidates as possible from amongst
those who have got more marks than the last candidate
selected to the extent of the vacancies still available out
of the advertised vacancies.
</p><p id="p_16">                            (5 of 6)
                                                     [CW-2553/2018]

Learned Additional Advocate General has filed the reply
in some of the petitions and has placed on record the
order dated 08.02.2017 showing that the Department is
trying to ascertain the factual position of the vacancies
in each of the Zila Parishads and also taking into account
the bifurcation of the vacancies as per the reservations.
It is stated that the detail of the vacancies for some of
the Zila Parishads have been received and from some of
the Zila Parishads, it is likely to be received in few days
time and after the whole process is completed, they
shall offer the appointment after verification of their
documents to the most meritorious candidates from
amongst those who have got more marks than the last
candidate still working with the department in pursuance
to the selection of the advertisement dated 24.02.2012.
</p>
<p id="p_17">In view of the fair stand taken by the respondent State
and appreciating the exercise being undertaken by them
to meet the situation in hand, all the abovementioned
writ petitions are disposed of as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">    a. The respondent-State shall workout the vacancies
    in each of the Zila Parishads as expeditiously as
    possible. Thereafter, the list shall be prepared of the
    candidates who have got more marks than the last
    candidate still working with the department in
    pursuance to the directions of this Court passed in
    Manju Choudhary's case (supra).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">    b. Thereafter, the candidates as per the ratio of 1:2
    of the vacancies available shall be called for the
    verification of the documents and the appointments
    shall be given to such like eligible candidates as per
    their merit equivalent to the vacancies available with
    the department.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">    c. This Court is aware that some of the candidates
    are bound to be left out even though they have got
    more marks than the last candidate but taking into
                                  (6 of 6)
                                                          [CW-2553/2018]

           account   the limited number of vacancies, the said
           candidates shall have to try their luck in the next
           recruitment process afresh.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">           d. The said process be completed as expeditiously as
           possible preferably within 06 months from today.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">     The writ petitions are disposed of accordingly."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_18">3.           In light of the aforequoted judgment, the writ petition

is disposed of with the direction to the respondents to decide the

representation of the petitioner in terms of aforementioned

precedent law subject to availability of the post in that particular

year within 90 days from today.
