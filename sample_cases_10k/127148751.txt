<p id="p_1">       This suit is filed for ejectment and for determination of mesne

profits.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">       2.   The case of plaintiff in brief is that the he is the absolute

owner of suit schedule property bearing No.666,situated in 11th

Main Road, Koramangala, Bangalore. The suit schedule property
                                    3              O.S.5623/2015




consists of ground floor and upper floor. Suit schedule property

originally belonged to his wife Smt.Geetha, who died due to terminal

ailments. He has succeeded to the suit schedule property under Will

executed by his wife in his favour. The defendant originally was a

tenant under Smt.S.Geetha, the wife of the plaintiff under

unregistered agreement of lease dated 10.01.2004, which came to

be executed by the defendant for occupation of the suit schedule

premises for commercial purpose. Defendant took the premises for

running a provision and general store and the tenancy of the

defendant is a month to month tenancy. The rate of rent for use and

occupation of the suit schedule premises is Rs.14,000/- per month.

After the death of Smt.Geetha, the wife of the plaintiff, the defendant

has attorned the tenancy in favour of the plaintiff.


</p><p id="p_4">      3.    It further case of the plaintiff that he has requested the

defendant to vacate the suit schedule premises as he required the

suit schedule property for establishment of his own business. The

defendant has failed to consider the request of the plaintiff,

thereafter on 22.05.2015 he has issued a legal notice to the

defendant by terminating the tenancy of the defendant and calling

upon the defendant to quit, vacate and deliver physical vacant
                                   4             O.S.5623/2015




possession of the suit schedule premises. In spite of receipt of the

legal notice, the defendant has not vacated the suit schedule

premises. The defendant has paid rent for the month of May 2015.

After the service of termination notice, the defendant has paid rent of

Rs.16,000/-. After issuance of termination notice to the defendant,

the plaintiff has received the rent as damages and occupancy

charges. He has also sent a letter to the defendant with regard to

the same.      In the termination notice, he has demanded the

defendant for payment of mesne profit for illegal use and occupation

of the suit schedule premises after termination of the lease.       He

reserves his right to claim mesne profit as against the defendant. He

claims mesne profit at the rate of 40,000/- per month, which is the

current prevailing rate in the locality, where the suit schedule

property is situated.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">      4.     It is further case of the plaintiff that the provisions of

Karnataka Rent Act do not apply to the suit schedule premises in

view of the rate of rent being more than statutory limit indicated and

also the extent of the property being more than 14 sq meters.      On

these grounds the plaintiff sought for a decree against the defendant

directing him to quit, vacate and deliver vacant physical possession
                                      5           O.S.5623/2015




of suit schedule non residential premises and also sought for

determination of mense profits under order XX rule 12 of CPC and

also sought for cost of the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">      5.     A perusal of the materials on record discloses that in

response to suit summons, the defendant appeared before the court

and contested the suit by filing the written statement. The defendant

in his written statement has contended that the suit of the plaintiff is

not maintainable in law since the same is not filed in accordance

with provision of section XXVI of CPC. The defendant has admitted

the fact that he was a tenant under the wife of the plaintiff by name

Smt.Geetha and further contended that after the death of

Smt.Geetha,     the   relationship   of   landlord   and   tenant   has

automatically and legally came to an end. The defendant has also

denied the plaintiff's title to the suit schedule property and also

denied the existence of jural relationship of landlord and tenant

between plaintiff and defendant. The defendant further contended

that the plaintiff has not intimated him about the execution of Will by

the wife of the plaintiff in favour of the plaintiff by bequeathing the

suit schedule property.       The defendant has also denied the

attornment of his tenancy in favour of the plaintiff after the death of
                                        6              O.S.5623/2015




Smt.Geetha, the wife of the plaintiff. The defendant further

contended that he had was paid initial monthly rent at the rate of

6,000/- per month and the rent was voluntarily and periodically

increased and the present rate of rent is Rs.16,000/- per month. The

defendant further contended that he is promptly paying the monthly

rent of the suit schedule property to the plaintiff and also denied the

valid termination of the tenancy.          The defendant also denied the

plaintiff right to claim mesne profits with respect to suit schedule

premises. The defendant further contended that plaintiff is already a

well established businessman having sufficient property and on the

other hand, he is a self employed person supporting his family of

seven members. Defendant further contended that since the plaintiff

is not the owner of the suit schedule property and in the absence of

existence of jural relationship of landlord and tenant, the suit of the

plaintiff is liable to be dismissed.

                      ISSUE NO.5 - As per final order,
for the following:-
                             REASONS

      11.    ISSUE NO.1.       A perusal of the pleadings of the parties

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_7">to the suit discloses that there are certain undisputed facts between

parties to the suit. The fact that defendant is originally was a tenant

with respect to suit schedule property under one Smt.Geetha, wife of

the plaintiff under unregistered agreement of lease dated 10.01.2004

is not in dispute. Further fact that under unregistered lease of

agreement dated 10.01.2004 defendant took the suit schedule

property for lease to run a provision and general store on a monthly

rent of Rs.6,000/- is also not in dispute. Further fact that on

04.01.2015, Smt.Geetha, the wife of the plaintiff died is also not in

dispute. Further fact that after the death of Smt.Geetha, the

defendant is paying rent at the rate of Rs.16,000/- per month to the

plaintiff with respect to suit schedule property is also not in dispute.</blockquote><p id="p_28">


</p><p id="p_29">      12.       A perusal of the pleadings and evidence on record

discloses that the defendant has contested this suit for ejectment

filed by the plaintiff by denying the title of the plaintiff to the suit

schedule property.       The learned counsel for the defendant has
                                     10              O.S.5623/2015




argued that since the plaintiff has not produced the alleged Will

executed by the wife of the plaintiff in favour of the plaintiff, the

plaintiff is not entitle to file this suit for ejectment. On the other hand,

the learned counsel for the plaintiff has argued that in a suit for

ejectment filed by the plaintiff against the defendant, the plaintiff is

not required to prove his title to the suit schedule property and

plaintiff is required only to prove the existence of jural relationship of

landlord and tenant between the plaintiff and defendant. In support

of his argument, the learned counsel for the plaintiff has relied on a

decision of apex court of the land reported between Payal Vision

Limited V/s. Radhika Choudry reported in 2012 (11) SCC 405,

wherein the apex court of the land is held that in a suit for recovery

of possession from a tenant, whose tenancy is not protected under

the provisions of the Rent Control Act, all that is required to be

established by the plaintiff landlord is the existence of jural

relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties and

termination of the tenancy either by lapse of time or by the notice

served by the landlord under <a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_1">section 106</a> of T.P.Act.


</p><p id="p_30">      13.    It is pertinent to note that it is settled principle of law that

in a suit for eviction by a landlord, the tenant is         estopped from
                                    11             O.S.5623/2015




questioning the title of the landlord in view of the provision of <a href="/doc/349627/" id="a_2">section

116</a> of T.P.Act. A tenant of immovable property under landlord who

becomes a tenant under another landlord by accepting him to be the

owner, who had derived title from former landlord cannot be

permitted to deny latter's title even when he is sought to be evicted

by the subsequent landlord.
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">      14.     A perusal of the pleadings and evidence of the parties

to the suit discloses that plaintiff has filed this suit for ejectment

against the defendant contending that he has succeeded to the

estate of his deceased wife under a Will. After the death of his wife,

the defendant has attorned his tenancy in favour of the plaintiff and

hence jural relationship of landlord and tenant exists between him

and the defendant. On the other hand, the defendant has contested

the suit by denying the existence of jural relationship of landlord and

tenant between him and the plaintiff. In view of the rival contentions

taken by the parties to the suit, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff

to prove the existence of jural relationship of landlord and tenant

between the him and the defendant.
</p>

plaintiff has not produced the alleged Will executed by his wife in his

favour under which he claims to have succeeded to the estate of his

deceased wife. However, a perusal of the contents of Ex.P.2-katha

certificate and Ex.P.3-Katha extract with respect to suit schedule

property discloses that katha of the suit schedule property stands in

the name of the plaintiff.    The contents of Ex.P.4 to 6 tax paid

receipts produced by the plaintiff discloses that the plaintiff has paid

tax with respect to suit schedule property.


</p><p id="p_34">      16.     The learned counsel for the plaintiff has argued that

after the death of Smt.Geetha, the wife of the plaintiff, the ownership

of the suit schedule property was transferred to the plaintiff and

hence the plaintiff steps into the shoes of original lessor

Smt.Geetha, the wife of the plaintiff and entitled to receive rent in

terms of lease by operation of <a href="/doc/313824/" id="a_3">section 109</a> of T.P.Act by way of

attornment of tenancy.

<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">      17.    In support of his arguments the learned counsel for the

plaintiff has relied upon a decision reported between Silvauddin V/s.

Nagaraju reported in 2004 ILR (Karnataka) 4782, wherein the

Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka has held that transfer of ownership

of premises to a person by the previous lessor, the transferee

persons become entitle to receive rent in terms of lease by operation

of <a href="/doc/313824/" id="a_4">section 109</a> of T.P.Act.      It was further held that in India no

attornment of tenancy is necessary in law as <a href="/doc/313824/" id="a_5">section 109</a> of T.P.Act

creates statutory attornment.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">      18.     In the present case in hand, a perusal of the materials

on record discloses that after the death of Smt.Geetha, the previous

lessor of the suit schedule property, there is transfer of ownership of

the schedule property in favour of plaintiff, the husband of

Smt.Geetha.     Further a perusal of the cross-examination of the

defendant discloses that after the death of Smt.Geetha, the

defendant has treated the plaintiff as his landlord and continued to

pay rent of the suit schedule property to him. In view of the statutory

attornment of tenancy under <a href="/doc/313824/" id="a_6">section 109</a> of T.P.Act, the contention

of the plaintiff that after the death of his wife Smt.Geetha since

ownership of the schedule premises was transferred to him, he has

stepped into the shoes of previous lessor and           there is jural

relationship of landlord and tenant between him and the defendant

has to be accepted.

<p id="p_39">      19.       By perusing the     oral and documentary evidence

produced on record, I hold that the plaintiff has proved the existence

defendant. With these observations, I answer issue No.1 in the

affirmative.

stating that by issuing Ex.P.9 legal notice dated 22.05.2015 he has

terminated the tenancy of the defendant with respect to suit

schedule premises. On the other hand, the defendant has disputed

the valid termination of tenancy by the plaintiff with respect to suit

schedule property. In view of the rival contentions, taken by the

parties to the suit, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to prove the

valid termination of tenancy with respect to the suit schedule

property.

<p id="p_42">
</p><p id="p_43">      21.      A perusal of the materials on record discloses that the

fact that the provisions of Karnataka Rent Act do not apply to the suit

schedule premises in view of the rate of rent being more than

statutory limit indicated and also the extent of property being more

than 14 sq meters is not in dispute. Further the fact that the tenancy

of the suit schedule property is month to month tenancy and the

defendant has taken the schedule premises for occupation of

commercial purpose is not in dispute.       Since the tenancy of the

schedule premises is month to month tenancy, which is not for

agricultural or manufacturing process, the same is terminable under

<a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_7">section 106</a> of T.P.Act on the part of either lessor or lessee by fifteen

days notice.

22.05.2015 discloses that plaintiff has given clear fifteen days notice

to the defendant as required under <a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_8">section 106</a> of T.P.Act.            A

perusal of cross-examination of defendant discloses that defendant

has admitted about the receipt of Ex.P.9-legal notice terminating his

tenancy. By considering the contents of Ex.P.9-legal notice, I hold

that the plaintiff by issuing Ex.P.9 legal notice under <a href="/doc/80042/" id="a_9">section 106</a> of

T.P.Act as validly terminated the tenancy of the defendant as

required under law.

vacated and handed over the vacant possession of the suit schedule

property, thereby he is in illegal use and occupation of the suit

schedule premises and required to pay mesne profit. Plaintiff has

claimed mesne profit at the rate of Rs.40,000/- per month, which

according to him is the current prevailing rate in the locality where

the suit schedule property is situated.

</p><p id="p_50">        25.   The learned counsel for the plaintiff has argued that in

spite of his termination of tenancy, the defendant has not vacated

the suit schedule premises and hence, he is in unauthorized

occupation of the suit schedule premises and required to pay mesne

profit to the plaintiff. It is further argued that the court by taking

judicial notice of the fact of increase of rent likely of suit schedule

property can determine the amount of mesne profits required to be

paid by the defendant to the plaintiff.

                 Andhra Pradesh has held that when a
                 tenant has taken residential premises on
                 lease and put the land lady to an
                 hazardous litigation, it is a fit case for
                 grant of damages. It was further held
                 that in awarding mesne profits, court can
                 take into consideration the factors such
                 as location of the premises, existing rent
                 and trend in raising of rental values.

                 Vinod Khanna and others V/s. Bakshi

                 Court of Delhi has held that in a suit for

                 evidence about increase of rent, judicial
                 notice can be taken about such increase
                 of rent.

perusal of the materials on record discloses that no substantial

evidence is led by the plaintiff with respect to the fact that the

prevailing rent in the locality, where the suit schedule property is

situated to claim mesne profits at the rate of Rs.40,000/- per month.

Considering the fact that the suit schedule property is located at
                                     18              O.S.5623/2015




Koramangala, Bangalore, one of the prime locality in Bangalore City

and considering the existing rent of the suit schedule property and

the trend in raising of the rental values, this court is of the opinion

that    the defendant, who has not vacated and handed over the

vacant possession of the suit schedule property even after

termination of his tenancy by the plaintiff is required to pay mesne

profit to the plaintiff at the rate of Rs.20,000/- per month from the

date of termination of tenancy till the date of handing over of vacant

possession of the suit schedule property by the defendant to the

plaintiff.     With these observations, I answer issue No.3 in the

plaintiff is not specific and relief sought by the plaintiff is not clear
