<p id="p_1">            The present revision petition has been moved under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a>

of the Constitution of India for setting aside the order dated 22.9.2011,

passed by the learned Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division), Sirsa,

whereby the application under Section 151 of CPC filed by the

applicant/defendant for leading additional evidence, was dismissed.

</p><p id="p_2">            Learned counsel for the petitioner/defendant No.1 submits that

the suit property was purchased by the petitioner through a registered sale-

deed. The conveyance deed dated 15.4.2005 was executed by the Executive

Engineer of PWD B&amp;R, Sirsa in favour of the petitioner in the office of

Sub-Registrar, Sirsa, which was got drafted by Shri Basti Ram, the then

Executive Engineer. He further submits that at the time of his examination,

this witness could not be examined as he was not posted at Sirsa at that

time. As his examination is necessary, therefore, the learned counsel seeks

an opportunity to examine this witness.

</p><p id="p_4">             Perusal of case file reveals that the suit has been filed for

declaration to the effect that the said conveyance-deed executed in favour of

the petitioner/defendant No.1 is illegal as the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 (i.e.

Plaintiffs No. 1 and 2), petitioner and proforma respondents No. 4 to 8 are

also entitled to get the said land in their favour jointly in equal shares being

in possession in equal shares from defendant Nos. 2 and 3. The learned trial

Court observed that the plaintiffs-respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have duly

admitted the existence of said conveyance deed and have only challenged its

legality, not its execution. The learned Trial Court further observed that as it

is established that the conveyance deed in question stands executed in

favour of the petitioner. there is no necessity to prove the deed in question.

Moreover, the learned trial Court also observed that defendant No.3-

Executive Engineer has already been impleaded as a party. Therefore, it is

very much in the knowledge of the petitioner that his case fully depends on

the said conveyance deed. However, he did not take due diligence by not

proving the said document according to the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2">Indian Evidence Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_5">             In the circumstance, this Court is of the view that the learned

trial Court has rightly held that application for leading additional evidence

cannot be allowed to fill in the lacuna especially when the petitioner-

defendant No.1 was fully conversant with the facts.        There is no material

illegality or irregularity in exercising of jurisdiction by the trial Court. It is

not permissible for this Court in exercise of powers under Section 115 of the

Code, to interfere with the order refusing additional evidence; that too at a

very belated stage, especially when both the parties have concluded their

evidence and the case is fixed for arguments

             In view of the above, I find no merit in the instant petition and

the same is accordingly dismissed in limine.
