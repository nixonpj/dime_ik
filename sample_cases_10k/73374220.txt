   adverse inference was drawn because the driver of the offending

   however, in a claim petition it is not so. In Bimla Devi and others  

   Vs. Himachal Road Transport Corporation and others (2009) 13

                                 necessary to be borne in mind that strict proof of

   LIABILITY

</p><p id="p_67">30.             R­3 has not pleaded any violation of terms and conditions 

   of insurance policy. However, it is contended that the accident took 

   place due to contributory negligence on the part of deceased. Here 

   it   will  be   suffice   to   mention   that   in  view  of   findings   on   issue   no.

   1(supra) the negligence on the part of R­1 has been prima facie 

   proved and  there  is  nothing  on record  to hold  negligence  on  the 

   part   of   deceased.   Therefore   the   said   contention   of   insurance 

   company is declined. 
</p>
<p id="p_68">31.             Admittedly the offending vehicle was being driven by R­1, 

   owned by R­2 and was insured with R­3. Therefore, R­1 is principal 

   tortfeasor. R­3 is vicariously liable. Respondents are held liable to 

   pay the awarded amount. Since the vehicle was insured with R­3, 

   therefore, it shall pay the awarded amount. 

</p><p id="p_69">32.             In view of the above discussions, issue no.2 is decided in 

   favour of the petitioners and against the respondents.
