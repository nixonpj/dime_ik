     Mahesh   Shivaji   Dighe   and   another   Vs.   State   of

     not considered that subsequently corrigendum was published on 




                                         
     12.07.1994 and 09.07.1994 that would explain the period of time 
                             
     within which award U/Sec. 11 has to be passed.

<p id="p_10">     7.       It is not disputed that, the award pursuant to which the 
   



     land of the present petitioner was acquired was subject matter of 
     consideration by this Court in a case of Mahesh Shivaji Dighe 





     and   another   Vs.   State   of   Maharashtra   and   others 
     referred to supra., so also in Writ Petition No. 1003 of 2013.  This 
     Court had set aside the award on the ground that, same is not 
     passed within a period of two years of declaration U/Sec. 6 of the 





     L.   A.   Act.     In   the   present   case,   the   petitioner's   land   being 
     acquired pursuant to the same award shall naturally receive the 
     same fate.

     not been paid any compensation amount pursuant to the award 




                                                      
     dated 08th March, 1996, in view of Sec. 24 (2) of the Right to Fair

     short "Right to Fair Compensation Act") stands lapsed.    Though 
     the same is not a ground raised in the present writ petition, but 
     the petitioner has stated that he has not received any amount of 




                                            
     compensation till date pursuant to the said award, relying on the 
                             
     said statement the provisions of Sec. 24(2) of the Right to Fair 
     Compensation Act can be made applicable.

     award dated 08.03.1996 to the extent it relates to the land of the 
      


     petitioner is quashed and set aside.  Pursuant to the said award
