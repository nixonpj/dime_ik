 BEFORE THE MADURAI BENCH OF MADRAS HIGH COURT

Dated: 04.12.2014

CORAM
THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE  M.VENUGOPAL

Writ Petition (MD) No.19717 of 2014

Balasubramanian			...	Petitioner


Vs


1.The Superintendent of Police,
  Sivagangai District,
  Sivagangai.

2.The Inspector of Police,
  Sivagangai Taluk Police Station,
  Sivagangai.				...	Respondents


	
Petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India praying
for the issuance of a writ of mandamus directing the Respondents herein to
grant permission to conduct the "Aadalum Paadalum" dance programme on
09.12.2014 from 10.00 p.m to 12.00 p.m in pursuant to the Eruthukattu
Thiruvizha festival of the "Sree Ayyanar  Ezhaikathal Amman Thirukovil"
situated at Thamarakki Village,  Sivagangai Taluk,  Sivagangai District,
considering the Petitioner's representation dated 03.12.2014 and pass such
further or other orders.

!For petitioner ...	Mr.D.Ramesh Kumar
^For respondents...	Mr.V.Muruganandam, AGP


:O R D E R
</pre>
<p id="p_1">	Heard both sides.
</p>	
<p id="p_2">	2.According to the Petitioner, the petitioner is a member of "Sree
Ayyanar Ezhaikathal Amman Thirukovil Committee".  He belongs to Thamarakki
Village,  Sivagangai Taluk,  Sivagangai District.   In the said village,
there is a temple called "Sree Ayyanar Ezhaikathal Amman Thirukovil".  It has
a rich heritage.  For the past 50 years, in the said temple, festivals and
cultural activities were conducted.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3.During this year, 'Eruthukattu Thiruvizha' festival for the year 2014
falls on 09.12.2014.  For the past several years, they have conducted
cultural programmes for the said festival.  They have also proposed to
conduct cultural activities, traditional programmes and Aadalum Padalum on
09.12.2014 between 10.00 p.m to 12.00 p.m.  It is also represented on behalf
of the petitioner that the petitioner had sent a representation on 03.12.2014
through post addressed to the second respondent, seeking permission to
conduct the Aadal Padal programme and the same was reportedly received by the
second respondent/Police on 27.11.2014 (As informed by the learned Additional
Government Pleader also before this Court) in connection with 'Eruthukattu
Thiruvizha' festival and till date, the representation is pending on the file
of the second respondent.  As a matter of fact, the second respondent has not
accorded permission for the said Aadal Padal programme in issue.
</p>

<p id="p_4">	4.In response, the learned Additional Government Pleader appearing for
the respondents submits that if permission is granted, the conduct of 'Aadal
Padal programme' on 09.12.2014, based on the representation of the
petitioner, then there is a possibility of cropping up of law and order
problem.
</p>
<p id="p_5">	5. It is to be noted that that the  commission of an act under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2"> the
Indian Penal Code</a> is punishable as an offence.  Similarly, the act done
contrary to the <a href="/doc/34053555/" id="a_3">Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act</a>, 1986,
then the same becomes an offence.  In reality, one cannot  assume or presume
of any illegal act/any illegality even before the grant of license for the
conduct of 'Adal Padal programme' at Chellampatti Village of the Petitioner
to be held on 31/10/2014.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	6.  It cannot be gainsaid that <a href="/doc/142493754/" id="a_4">Section 2</a> (c) of the <a href="/doc/34053555/" id="a_5">Indecent
Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act</a>, 1986, defines
	?Indecent representation of women? means the depiction in any manner of
the figure of a woman, her form or body or any part thereof in such a way as
to have the effect of being indecent, or derogatory to, or denigrating,
women, or is likely to deprave, corrupt or injure the public morality or
morals.?
</p>

<p id="p_7">	7.  As a matter of fact, <a href="/doc/96293110/" id="a_6">Section 3</a> of the Act, 1986 refers to
Prohibition of advertisements containing indecent representation of woman.
Also that <a href="/doc/124708675/" id="a_7">Section 4</a> of the Act enjoins Prohibition of Publication or Sending
by post of books, pamphlets, etc., containing indecent representation of
women.
</p>
<p id="p_8">	8. In this connection, this Court very significantly points out that
there must be a subsisting right enforceable in a Court of Law on an
individual and there must be a corresponding duty for issuance of Writ of
Mandamus.  An aggrieved person must have a legal right and he must aver that
there is an infringement of public duty.  At this stage, this Court worth
recalls and recollects the decision of the DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMENTS, A.P AND
OTHERS Vs. M.R.APPARAO AND ANOTHER {(2002) 4 SUPREME COURT CASES 638},
wherein it is held that 'the powers of the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Art.226</a> of the
Constitution of India though a discretionary one and no limits can be placed
upon their discretion, they must be exercised along with recognised lines and
subject to certain  self-imposed limitations'.
</p>
<p id="p_9">	9. Apart from the above, on behalf of the Petitioner, no Statute or
Enactment is cited or relied upon which confers a right upon the Petitioner
to conduct/hold 'Adal Padal programme'.
</p>
<p id="p_10">	10.  One cannot brush aside an important fact that India is a signatory
to the Convention of Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women
and the same is adopted by the United Nations  General Assembly in the year
1979.  Further,  <a href="/doc/19636/" id="a_9">Art.6</a> of the Convention enjoins that the state parties to
take appropriate steps to suppress all forms of trafficking and exploitation
of women.	
</p>
<p id="p_11">	11. Also, that Section 3 of the (Tamil Nadu) Dramatic Performance Act,
1954 (which came into force on 12/1/1955) speaks of 'Power of the State
Government to prohibit objectionable performances.'  <a href="/doc/124708675/" id="a_10">Section 4</a> of the Act,
1954 also deals about the Power of the Commissioner of Police in the
Presidency Town or the District elsewhere to prohibit objectionable
performances temporarily.  <a href="/doc/110770027/" id="a_11">Section 5</a> of the Act mentions about the 'Service
of order of Prohibition'.  In fact, <a href="/doc/45559669/" id="a_12">Section 6</a> of the Act, 1954 deals about
the penalty for disobeying the order referred to in <a href="/doc/96293110/" id="a_13">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/124708675/" id="a_14">4</a> and the
same being served on the person concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_12">	12. It is true that <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_15">Art.19 (1) (a)</a> of the Constitution speaks of free
speech and expression, but the same is subject to restrictions under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_16">Article
19 (ii</a>), in the considered opinion of this Court.  Also that a Script or Play
or Drama will be considered as an objectionable one only when it falls within
any of six  sub-clauses mentioned in <a href="/doc/142493754/" id="a_17">Section 2</a> (i) of the Tamil Nadu Dramatic
Performance Act, 1954.  The provisions of the Tamil Nadu Dramatic Performance
Act, 1954 would certainly fall well within the bounds of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_18">Art.19</a> of the
Constitution of India, as opined by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_13">	13. Undoubtedly, the right to freedom of speech and expression is a
valuable and cherished the right possessed by a Citizen of our Country.  It
is always open to the State Government to impose/make such reasonable
restrictions which are permissible as envisaged under <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_19">Art.19 (2)</a> of the
Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_14">	14.  Added further, no person can be deprived by his fundamental
rights.  The State by its legislative power is entitled to regulate the
fundamental rights by imposing reasonable restrictions.  However, the said
restrictions must be  related to <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_20">Art.19 (2)</a> of the Constitution of India.
Each restriction must be a reasonable  one.  The restriction to be imposed
can only be within the authority of Law.  A restriction cannot be exercised
merely by an executive power without any Law to back it.  In this connection,
this Court pertinently points out the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in THE SUPERINTENDENT, CENTRAL PRISON, FATEHGARH AND ANOTHER Vs. Dr.RAAM
MANOHAR LOHIA {AIR 1960 SUPREME COURT CASES  633 (V 47 C 100)}, whereby and
whereunder, it is observed and held as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_15">	?Concept of  'public order' in India before the amendment of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_21">Art.19</a> by
the Constitution (First Amendment) Act 1951, in America and in England
compared, AIR 1950 SC 124and air 1950 SC 129 and AIR 1952 SC 329 AND (1940)
310 US 296, Ref.
</p>
<p id="p_16">	By the amendment of <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_22">Art.19 (2)</a> by the Constitution (First Amendment)
Act, 1951 the wide concept of 'public order' is split up under different
heads.  All the grounds mentioned in cl (2) can be brought under the general
head 'public order' in its most comprehensive sense.  But the juxtaposition
of the different grounds indicates that though sometimes they tend to
overlap, they must be ordinarily intended to exclude each other.  'Public
order' is, therefore, something which is demarcated from the others.  In that
limited sense, particularly in view of 'public order' is synonymous with
public peace, safety and tranquillity.  It is the absence of disorder
involving breaches of local significance in contradistinction to national
upheavals, such as revolution, civil strife and war, affecting the security
of the State.
</p>
<p id="p_17">	The distinction between the phrases ?in the interest of public order?
and ?for the maintenance of public order?, does not ignore the necessity for
intimate connection between the Act and the public order sought to be
maintained by the Act. (S) AIR 1957 SC 896, expl.:(S) AIR 1957 SC 620.Ref.
</p>
<p id="p_18">	The limitation that the restrictions shall be ?reasonable?, brings
about the same result.  In order to be reasonable, the limitation must have a
proximate connection with ?public order? and not one far-fetched,
hypothetical, problematical or too remote. AIR 1950 FC 67, Ref. and applied.?
</p>
<p id="p_19">	15.  In view of the fact that the petitioner is desirous of conducting
the Aadal Padal festival on 09.12.2014 at 07.00 p.m  at Thamarakki Village,
Sivagangai Taluk, Sivagangai District in connection with the festival of
"Sree Ayyanar  Ezhaikathal Amman Thirukovil", this Court grants permission to
