P.W. 1 to P.W. 4 that they and accused were working in Parle

G factory. P.W.1 has deposed that he has sustained injuries

due to fall from the vehicle. P.W. 1 who is the complainant

and injured has not deposed anything against the accused.

P.W. 1 and accused may set right their differences, hence,

P.W. 1 to P.W. 4 may not supported the case of the

prosecution; for which the prosecution cannot be blamed.

Even though the Learned Spl.Public Prosecutor           cross-

examined P.W. 1 to P.W. 4 in detail nothing is elicited from

their mouth to support the case of the prosecution. There is

no iota of evidence on the side of the prosecution to show that

the accused persons have committed the offences punishable

and u/s 3(1)(x) of S.C. &amp; S.T. (P.A.) Act. The prosecution has

failed to bring home the guilt of the accused beyond all

reasonable doubt.   Hence, I answer points no.1 to 8 in the

negative.
