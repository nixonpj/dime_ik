       S/O LATE CHOWDAPPA

(By Sri. VIJAYAKUMAR MAJAGE, ADDL.SPP FOR R1
                              2


R2 SERVED AND UNREPRESENTED)

      THIS CRL.PETITION IS FILED U/S.482 CR.P.C PRAYING
TO QUASH THE ENTIRE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE
PETITIONERS HEREIN IN C.C.NO.11110/2017 AND ALL ITS
CONSEQUENT PROCEEDINGS PENDING ON THE FILE OF THE
HON'BLE V ADDITIONAL CMM, BENGALURU.

      THIS CRIMINAL PETITION COMING ON FOR ADMISSION,
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                        ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Heard learned counsel for petitioners and learned

Addl. S.P.P. for respondent No.1.      Respondent No.2 is

served and unrepresented. Perused the records.


</p><p id="p_2">     2.    A reading of the complaint on the face of it

indicates that the petitioners/accused are impleaded for the

alleged offence solely on a suspicion. According to the

complainant/respondent No.2, on 22.1.2015 he found the

compound wall surrounding his property was demolished.

The complaint is silent as to the details of the perpetrator

of the said crime. In the charge sheet it is stated that the

alleged act of demolition was carried out by the employees

of the petitioners who are named as accused Nos.1 and 2.

There is no material to show as to when and how and in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span>


what manner the compound wall was demolished.                 As a

matter of fact, there is no evidence regarding the existence

of the compound wall surrounding the property of the

complainant. Merely on the ground that the petitioners are

the owners of the adjoining building, the petitioners herein

appear to have been implicated in the alleged offence. The

material on record even if accepted as true, does not

constitute the ingredients of the offence under <a href="/doc/222396/" id="a_1">Sections 427</a>

and <a href="/doc/162506/" id="a_2">447</a> of IPC insofar as the petitioners are concerned.


</p><p id="p_3">       3.    In   the   above   the   said   circumstances,    the

prosecution of the petitioners without any reliable material

would be an abuse of the process of Court. As a result,

prosecution launched against the petitioners cannot be

sustained.   Consequently, the petition is allowed.           The

impugned criminal proceedings against the petitioners in

C.C.No.11110/2017 pending on the file of the V Addl. CMM,

Bengaluru, are quashed.
