<p id="p_1">             (PER : HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE M.R. SHAH)


      After order dated 26.02.2014, the matter was adjourned to
today. When the present application is taken up for further hearing,
Mr.Premal Joshi, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the
respondent - Chief Officer of Karamsad Nagar Palika has stated at the
bar that the statement which was made on last occasion i.e. on
26.02.2014 to the effect that even six employees were handed over
the cheques, was under the instruction from the respondent and is
found to be untrue and false and, therefore, he would like to retire
from the matter. He has stated at the bar under the instruction of the
respondent that even those six employees were handed over the
cheques, however, they were unsigned. We are of the prima facie

            C/MCA/38/2014                              ORDER




opinion that having found that the respondent has made a false /
incorrect statement before the Court that the aforesaid six employees
were handed over the cheques and in fact, their signatures with
respect to accepting the cheques were taken under coercion / under
pressure, the story has been changed and it is now stated that those
six employees were handed over the cheques without signatures.
</p>

<p id="p_2">        The aforesaid is nothing but an improved version after having
found that incorrect and false statement was made before this Court
and that the respondent tried to mislead this Court. The respondent -
Chief Officer of Karamsad Nagar Palika is personally present before
the Court. As on today, we are not permitting Mr.Premal Joshi,
learned advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent to retire
from the matter as his presence would very much be required and
necessary in the matter. However, so as to enable the respondent to
engage other lawyer, S.O to 4th March 2014. This order is passed in
presence of the respondent himself.
