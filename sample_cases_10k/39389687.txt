      THIS PETITION IS FILED UNDER SECTION UNDER
SECTION 482 OF CR.P.C., SEEKING TO QUASH THE
PROCEEDINGS INIITATED AGAINST THE PETITIONERS FOR THE
OFFENCE UNDER SECTION 328 OF <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a> IN S.C.NO.163/2018 ON
THE FILE OF VII ADDL. DISTRICT AND SESSIONS JUDGE,
SITTING AT CHIKKODI AT BELAGAVI.

     THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR ADMISSION THIS DAY,
THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:

                          ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the

petitioners   and   the   learned   Addl.   SPP   for   the

respondent-state.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.   The factual matrix of the case is that Inspector of

Police Aigali police station in Athani Taluka, Dist:

Belavagi, lodged a complaint before the Station House in

Athani Taluka of Belagavi District, alleging that on

20.03.2016 at about 17.00 hours received a credible

information that two persons are transporting toddy on

a motorcycle and when intercepted the vehicle at about

17.45 hours with regard to residential address of the

persons on the motor cycle and when no proper reply

was received and on enquiry, the two riders introduced

themselves as the petitioners and further enquiry as to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             3</span>


the transportation of the toddy, it was informed by the

riders that they were transporting Toddy to their village

and on enquiry as to whether the petitioners had any

license or permit to transport the liquor, the petitioners

replied as having no license and the same was seized

100 ml sample was sealed in a separate pouch. Hence,

<a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_2">Section 328</a> of IPC and Sections 32 and 34 of Indian

Excise Act, was invoked against the petitioners.


</p><p id="p_4">3.   The petitioners in this petition has contended that

there is no any prima facie material to invoke <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_3">Section

328</a> of IPC. which contemplated of an offence of causing

hurt by means of poison with an intent to commit an

offence   by   using   poison   or   any   intoxicating   or

unwholesome drug or other thing with intent to cause

hurt to such person and in the absence of any such

material the police have invoked <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_4">Section 328</a> of IPC and

the substance alleged to have been seized toddy also

contains only 8% alcohol content which is far below the

consumable liquor marketed by the Government itself
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>


and hence alleging an offence under Section under

<a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_5">Section 328</a> of IPC is branding the same to be poisonous

amounts to abuse of process of law. Hence, this Court

to   invoke   <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_6">Section   482</a>     of   Cr.P.C.   to   quash     the

proceedings insofar as invoking <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_7">Section 328</a> of IPC in

S.C.No.163/2018 on the file of the VII Addl. District and

Sessions Judge, sitting at Chikkodi at Belagavi.


</p><p id="p_5">4.    Learned    counsel      for    the   petitioners   in   his

arguments has reiterated the grounds urged in the

petition and further contended that there are no

materials to invoke <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_8">Section 328</a> of IPC and proceedings

against the petitioner for the offence under <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_9">Section 328</a>

of IPC is contrary to law and nothing but abuse of

process.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">5.    Per contra, learned Addl. SPP appearing for the

respondent state in his arguments contends that the

quantity of toddy was seized 20 litres and sample was

collected and subjected to Laboratory examination and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 5</span>


the same found 8% of alcohol and there are no grounds

to entertain the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">6.    Having heard the arguments of the learned

counsel for the petitioner and learned Addl. SPP for

respondent, the point that arises whether this Court

can exercise the powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.


</p><p id="p_10">7.    On considering the factual matrix of the case is

that the accused persons were carrying toddy and

allegation is that it was 20 litres and case has been

registered for the offence under <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_10">Section 328</a> of IPC and

<a href="/doc/151968657/" id="a_11">Sections 32</a> and <a href="/doc/134179606/" id="a_12">34</a> of Excise Act. It is rightly pointed

out by the learned counsel that there must be a

poisonous substance causing hurt with an intent to

commit    an   offence    and       toddy   is   not   poisonous

substance on reading of <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_13">Section 328</a> of IPC. It is clear

that whoever administers or causes to be taken by any

person   by    using     poison     or   any     intoxicating   or

unwholesome drug or other thing with intent to cause
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                             6</span>


hurt to such person or with intent to commit an offence

to cause hurt or to facilitate the commission of an

offence are going to be likely that he will thereby cause

hurt    shall   be   punished   with   imprisonment    of

description for a term which may extend to 10 years

and shall also be liable to be quashed.


</p><p id="p_11">8.     For having considered penal provision of <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_14">Section

328</a> of IPC and also substance which was seized by the

police, i.e., toddy and in order to invoke <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_15">Section 328</a> of

IPC there is no any such allegation of administering of

poisonous substance of any person and in the case on

hand the accused persons were allegedly carrying 20

litres of toddy and when such being the case, it is

nothing but an abuse of process for invoking <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_16">Section

328</a> of IPC against the petitioners and there are no

material to constitute an offence under <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_17">Section 328</a> of

IPC.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                              7</span><p id="p_12">


</p><p id="p_13">9.    Under the circumstance, there is a force in the

contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners that

no material to invoke <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_18">Section 328</a> of IPC against the

petitioners is nothing but abuse of process which

amounts to miscarriage of justice and the petitioners'

counsel fairly submits that invoking of <a href="/doc/151968657/" id="a_19">Sections 32</a> and

<a href="/doc/134179606/" id="a_20">34</a>, he has no any grouse.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">10.   In view of the discussions made above, I proceed

to pass the following:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                         ORDER

      The petition is allowed.</blockquote><p id="p_16">


</p><p id="p_17">      The proceedings initiated against the petitioners

for the offence under <a href="/doc/1535430/" id="a_21">section 328</a> of IPC is hereby

quashed.
