                        CRL.R.P.NO. 3307 OF 2008
                          ............................................
            DATED THIS THE 30th DAY OF SEPTEMBER, 2008

                                         ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">       Petitioner was concurrently convicted and sentenced for the offence

under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_1">Section 138</a> of N.I.Act. First respondent is the complainant. Case of

first respondent, Co-operative society is that petitioner borrowed

Rs.2,00,000/- from the society and towards its discharge, issued Ext.P1

cheque dated 1.10.2005 for Rs.1,91,025/-                       drawn in his account and

maintained in Konny branch of South Indian Bank Limited and when the

cheque was presented for encashment,                     it was dishonoured for want of

sufficient funds and in spite of notice served on the petitioner demanding

the amount covered by the cheque, he did not pay the amount and thereby

committed offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_2">Section 138</a> of N.I.Act.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       2. Petitioner pleaded not guilty.                 Learned       Magistrate, on the

evidence of the Secretary of first respondent as PW1 and Exts. P1 to P3,

DW1 and Exts.D1 and D2, found the petitioner guilty and convicted and

sentenced him to simple imprisonment for six months, and a compensation

of Rs.2,00,000/- and in default, simple imprisonment for a period of three

months under <a href="/doc/640437/" id="a_3">Section 357(3)</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure. Petitioner

challenged     the   conviction       and       sentence           before Sessions  Court,

Pathanamthitta in Crl.A.86 of 2007.                       Learned Sessions Judge, on

reappreciation of evidence, confirmed the conviction, but modified the

sentence to imprisonment till rising of court and a fine of Rs.2,00,000/- and

in default, simple imprisonment for six months. The conviction and sentence

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CRRP 3307/2008                        2</span>

is challenged in this revision petition filed under <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_4">Section 397</a> and <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_5">401</a> of

Code of Criminal Procedure.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3. Learned counsel appearing for petitioner was heard. Learned

counsel argued that courts below did not properly appreciate the case and

failed to note that the cheque was not issued towards discharge of an

existing liability and therefore the conviction is not sustainable. It was

contended that learned Magistrate should have found that petitioner had

only issued a blank cheque at the time when he availed of the loan and it

was not issued towards repayment of the loan and therefore the conviction

is bad. It was finally argued that petitioner may be granted four months'

time to pay the fine amount considering his financial conditions.

</p><p id="p_4">      4. On hearing the learned counsel and going through the judgments

of the courts below, I do not find any reason to interfere with the conviction.

Evidence of PW1 establish that first respondent availed a loan of

Rs.2,00,000/- and towards repayment of balance amount of Rs.1,91,025/-

due, issued Ext.P1cheque. Evidence also establish that when the cheque

was presented for encashment, it was dishonoured for want of sufficient

funds and first respondent has complied with all the statutory formalities

provided under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_6">Section 138</a> and <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_7">142</a> of N.I.Act. Therefore conviction of

petitioner for the offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_8">Section 138</a> of N.I.Act, is perfectly legal and

proper.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5. Then the question is with regard to the sentence.Learned Sessions

Judge modified the sentence to imprisonment till rising of court and a fine

of Rs.2,00,000/- and in default, simple imprisonment for six months. I do not

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CRRP 3307/2008                        3</span>

find any reason to interfere with sentence also. But in view of the submission

of learned counsel that because of financial conditions, he could not pay the

fine and needs four months' time, petitioner is granted four months time

from today to pay the fine and to appear before learned Magistrate as

directed by learned Sessions Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6. Revision petition is dismissed. Petitioner is granted four months

time from today to pay the fine and to appear before the Magistrate as

directed by learned Sessions Judge. Petitioner is directed to appear before

learned Magistrate on the expiry of four months from today.
