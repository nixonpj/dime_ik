<div class="doc_title">Jeevan Lal Rathor vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 13 February, 2013</div><pre id="pre_1">             WRIT PETITION No.1917/2013                          1




13.02.2013

      Shri Sanjay Sharma, learned Counsel for the
petitioner.
      Shri    Rajesh   Tiwari,     learned     Panel    Lawyer for
respondents No.1 and 2 on advance copy.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The grievance of the petitioner is that the Collector
has passed a specific order on 27.08.2012, on the
directions issued by this Court in the earlier writ petition
of the petitioner, duly recording the undertaking made by
the respondents-authorities that the construction of the
well of the petitioner would be done by the end of
December, 2012. In this order it was categorically said
that since the lapses were committed by the authorities
concerned, they were imposed a fine of Rs.1,000/- and it
was warned that in case the construction work is not
completed by the end of December, 2012, strict action
would be taken against the defaulting authorities. It is
complained     that    though      such   an    undertaking   was
recorded, yet the construction was not completed and
when the complaint was made before the Collector
informing about the order passed by him, no action is
taken by the said authorities, therefore, this writ petition
is required to be filed.
</p><p id="p_2">      The     Collector    being    the      District   Programme
Coordinator of the scheme formulated by the State
Government, is responsible to see that scheme is
implemented in appropriate manner within the district.
He himself has passed the order warning the authorities
subordinate to him to complete the work.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                  WRIT PETITION No.1917/2013                    2</span>




<p id="p_3">           Looking to the aforesaid, the Collector, Damoh, is
      directed to look into the complaint of the petitioner in
      respect of his own order dated 27.08.2012 and take
      action against the defaulting authorities without any loss
      of time.
</p><p id="p_4">           With the aforesaid, the writ petition is finally
      disposed of.
</p><p id="p_5">           Certified copy as per rules.
</p>
