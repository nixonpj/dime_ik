</p>

<p id="p_12">        3.   Though the suit summons was duly served on the
Defendant through paper publication, it was remained absent and
hence, it is placed as exparte on 19.11.2016.

<p id="p_16">        9.   The P.W.1, who is the City Case Officer of the Plaintiff
Bank, has stated in his examination-in-chief that, the Defendant
had approached their Bank through SMECCC Shankarpuram, for
sanction of cash credit facility for the purpose of his business and
pursuant to which, their Bank sanctioned loan of Rupees
75,000/- under Cash Credit Facility on 16.08.2012 and the cash
credit facility was to be repaid on demand or 36 months subject
review every 12 months, with interest at the rate of 1.50% above
base rate, i.e., 10.50% with a minimum of 10.50% p.a., rising or
 SCH-7                              7                 S.C.No.1562/2016


falling it with, on daily products with monthly rests. He has
further stated that, the Defendant agreeing to the terms and
conditions of loan, has acknowledged the Letter of Arrangement
and Agreement of Loan-Cum-Hypothecation at the time of the
sanction of loan.
</p>

<p id="p_17">        10.   To corroborate his case as well as the oral evidence of
P.W.1,    the   Plaintiff   Bank   has   produced   Ex.P.1   Letter     of
Arrangement dated 17.08.2012 and Ex.P.2 Agreement of Loan-
Cum-Hypothecation dated 27.09.2012.
</p>

<p id="p_18">        11.   On perusal of the contents of Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.2, it
clearly goes to show that, on 16.08.2012, the Defendant has
borrowed a loan of Rupees 75,000/- from the Plaintiff Bank for the
purpose of his business and he has agreed to repay the said loan
amount in 36 months with interest at the rate of 1.50% above
base rate, i.e., 10.50%, with a minimum of 10.50% per annum
rising or falling with daily products with monthly rests and by
agreeing to the terms and conditions of the said loan, the
Defendant has executed the necessary and required documents in
favour of the Plaintiff Bank. The contents of Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.2
clearly corroborated with the oral evidence of P.W.1 as well as the
case made out by the Plaintiff Bank as against the Defendant in
the present suit.
</p>

<p id="p_19">        12.   The P.W.1 has stated that, the Defendant failed to
adhere to various terms and conditions mentioned in the
Agreement and has committed defaults and the Defendant has not
 SCH-7                                8                    S.C.No.1562/2016


made     payments      as   agreed   and   the   dues     of   their    Bank
accumulated and inspite of several requests, the Defendant has
not regularized the account and then, their Bank got issued the
legal notice to the Defendant calling upon it to pay the amount
due and requested for clearing the entire outstanding dues and
the Defendant evaded receiving the notices. He has further stated
that, the Defendant being a proprietary concern, its proprietor,
who is a borrower, is liable to pay the amount due to their Bank.
He has further stated that, the outstanding dues of loan of the
Defendant payable to their Bank is of Rupees 90,702/- under
Cash Credit Facility including the interest till date, which is not
applied to the account extract as per the Guidelines issued by the
Reserve Bank of India for income recognition purpose. He has
further stated that, the amount now due to their Bank is
outstanding amounts as per the extract is of Rupees 73,931/-,
accrued interest is of Rupees 13,092/-, accrued penalty interest is
of Rupees 2,679/- and legal notice charges is of Rupees 1,000/-,
totally of Rupees 90,702/-.
</p>

<p id="p_20">        13.   The Plaintiff Bank has produced Ex.P.3 Office Copy of
Legal Notice dated 09.08.2016, Ex.P.4 Postal Receipts 2 in
numbers,      Ex.P.5   Returned      Unserved    Postal     Cover,     Ex.P.6
Returned Unserved Postal Cover and Ex.P.7 Statement of Account.
</p>

<p id="p_21">        14.   On perusal of the entries made in Ex.P.7 Statement of
Account, it prima-facie appears that, the Defendant is very
irregular in making payment of loan installments to the Plaintiff
 SCH-7                                9                     S.C.No.1562/2016


Bank as agreed and as such, as on 17.03.2016, a sum of Rupees
73,931/- is due as outstanding loan amount, Rupees 13,092/-
towards accrued interest and Rupees 2,679/- towards accrued
penalty interest, in total, Rupees 89,702/- is due from the
Defendant to the Plaintiff Bank.
</p>

<p id="p_22">        15.    On perusal of the contents of Ex.P.3 to Ex.P.6, it is
further made crystal clear that, before filing the present suit, the
Plaintiff     Bank   has made    a       prompt   effort   for   recovery of
outstanding due amount from the Defendant through RPAD, but,
the Defendant did not respond the same and as such, the Plaintiff
Bank, as no other alternative way, has filed the present suit for
recovery of suit claim of Rupees 89,072/- from the Defendant.
Therefore, the Plaintiff Bank has cause of action for filing the
present suit as against the Defendant and as such, it is
maintainable.
</p>

<p id="p_23">        16.    The Plaintiff Bank has also claimed legal notice
charges of Rupees 1,000/- from the Defendant. The Defendant did
not care to repay the outstanding loan amount and the Defendant
has dragged the Plaintiff Bank to file the present suit. Hence, the
Plaintiff Bank is entitled for legal notice charges of Rupees 1,000/-
from the Defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_24">        17.    From the said material evidence, both oral and
documentary, it is clearly proved that, as on the date of filing of
the suit, a sum of Rupees 90,702/- is due from the Defendant to
the Plaintiff Bank, which is the suit claim.
</p><p id="p_25"> SCH-7                            10               S.C.No.1562/2016



</p><p id="p_26">        18.   The date of loan is on 16.08.2012. The Plaintiff Bank
has filed the present suit as against the Defendant on 31.08.2016.
On perusal of the said dates, it prima-facie appears that, the suit
filed by the Plaintiff Bank is not well within time. But, based on
the same, it cannot be said that, the suit filed by the Plaintiff
Bank is barred by law of limitation, as such, it is not
maintainable, as, on perusal of the entries made in Ex.P.7
Statement of Account, it clearly goes to show that, the Defendant
has made the last payment of Rupees 3,000/- on 01.07.2015 and
within 3 years from the said date, the Plaintiff Bank has filed the
present suit as against the Defendant. Therefore, the suit filed by
the Plaintiff Bank as against the Defendant is well within time and
as such, it is maintainable.
</p>

<p id="p_27">        19.   The Plaintiff Bank has claimed current and future
interest at the rate of 12% per annum compounded at monthly
rests from the date of suit till realization on the suit claim of
Rupees 90,072/- from the date of suit till its realization with
costs.
</p>

<p id="p_28">        20.   Based on the entries made in Ex.P.7 Statement of
Account, this Court has already observed and come to the
conclusion that, the Defendant is very irregular in making
repayment of loan to the Plaintiff Bank as agreed. Further, based
on the contents of Ex.P.1 Letter of Arrangement dated 17.08.2012,
Ex.P.2 Agreement of Loan-Cum-Hypothecation, this Court has
further clearly observed and come to the conclusion that, the
 SCH-7                            11                   S.C.No.1562/2016


Defendant has agreed to repay the said loan amount of Rupees
75,000/- with interest at the rate of 1.50% above base rate, i.e.,
10.50% with a minimum of 10.50% per annum rising or falling
therewith on daily products with monthly rests. Further, the
P.W.1 has clearly stated that, the present effective interest rate is
12.00% per annum on daily products with monthly rests.
Therefore, the claim of current and future interest at the rate of
12% per annum compounded at monthly rests on suit claim of
Rupees 90,702/- by the Plaintiff Bank from the Defendant from
the date of filing of this suit till its realization is acceptable one.
Further, since, the Defendant has dragged the Plaintiff Bank to file
the present suit for recovery of Rupees 90,072/- inspite of
issuance of legal notice, there are merits in the claim of costs of
the present suit by the Plaintiff from the Defendant.
</p>

<p id="p_29">        21.   Under the above said facts and circumstances as well
as the reasons given, this Court has come to the conclusion that,
by   adducing     acceptable   material   evidence,   both   oral   and
documentary, the Plaintiff Bank has clearly proved that, as on the
date of filing of the present suit, a sum of Rupees 70,092/- is due
from the Defendant to it and also it is liable to pay current and
future interest at the rate of 12% p.a., compounded at monthly
rests on the suit claim of Rupees 90,072/- from the date of the
present suit till its realization with costs. The Plaintiff Bank is
entitled for the same from the Defendant. To deny or to discard
the same, nothing is available on record on behalf of the
Defendant, as, though the suit summons was duly served on the
 SCH-7                            12                  S.C.No.1562/2016


Defendant through paper publication, it has not appeared before
this Court and as such, it is placed as exparte. The non-
appearance of the Defendant in the present suit clearly implies
that, it has indirectly admitted the entire case made out by the
Plaintiff Bank as against it as well as the evidence adduced by it to
consider its case in the present suit. Hence, the Defendant is
liable to pay the suit claim of Rupees 90,072/- with current and
future interest at the rate of 12.5% per annum compounded at
monthly rests from the date of this suit till its realization with
costs, to the Plaintiff Bank. Hence, the suit filed by the Plaintiff
Bank as against the Defendant is liable to be decreed with costs.
Accordingly, I answered Point No.1 in the Affirmative.
