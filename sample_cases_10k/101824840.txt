                                       JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1.     Vide this judgment I shall dispose of the complaint filed by the complainant
under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_2">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to
as the 'Act ').
</p>

<p id="p_2">2.     Brief facts relevant for the decision of the case are as under:-
</p><p id="p_3">       The complainant alleges that in 01.10.2016, he advanced friendly loan of
an amount of Rs. 4,30,000/- to the accused for a period of nine months. After
expiry of period of nine months i.e. in July, 2017, accused issued two post dated
cheques i.e. one cheque bearing No. 470186 dated 11.09.2017 for Rs.3,00,000/-
drawn on SBI, Janakpuri, Delhi and another cheque i.e. cheque No. 003486
(cheque in question) dated 11.08.2017 for Rs.1,30,000/- drawn on ICICI Bank,
Lajpat Nagar, Delhi to complainant in satisfaction of loan, with an assurance of
their encashment.      After due date of cheque in question, the complainant
presented the cheque in his account maintained at IDBI Bank, Vijay Enclave,
Palam Dabri, Delhi which was returned with the remarks "Funds Insufficient"
vide bank return memo dated 14.08.2017. Thereafter, complainant served a legal
notice dated 04.09.2017 upon the accused through his counsel demanding the
said amount. Despite service of aforesaid notice, neither any reply was sent nor
the money was repaid by the accused. Thereafter, complainant has filed the
present complaint case with the submission that accused be summoned, tried and
punished according to law.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3.     In his pre-summoning evidence, complainant examined himself on affidavit
Ex. CW-1/7. He reiterated the contents of complaint and placed on record, original
cheque i.e. cheque No. 003486 dated 11.08.2017 (cheque in question) for
Rs.1,30,000/- drawn on ICICI Bank, Lajpat Nagar, Delhi as Ex. CW-1/1, cheque
returning memo dated 14.08.2017 as Ex. CW-1/2, legal demand notice dated
04.09.2017 as Ex. CW-1/3, receipts of speed post as Ex. CW-1/4 and tracking
reports as Ex.CW1/5 and complaint as Ex.CW1/6.
</p>

<p id="p_5">Rakesh Kumar Sharma Vs. Dhananjay Kumar Tiwari   CC No. 21015/17      Page no. 2 of 10
</p><p id="p_6"> 4.     Upon appreciation of pre-summoning evidence, accused was summoned
for an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_3">Section 138</a> of the Act and notice under <a href="/doc/429078/" id="a_4">Section
251</a> Cr.P.C. for this offence was framed upon accused on 04.07.2018 to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. He admitted his signatures on the cheque in
question and also stated that all the remaining details in the cheque have also
been filled by him. He denied taking any loan from complainant and stated that he
had approached complainant in December, 2016 for loan of Rs.1,00,000/-. He
also stated that he gave cheque in question as fully filled up cheque towards
repayment of loan alongwith interest. However, the loan was not advanced to him
and cheque was also not returned to him. Thereafter, again he had discussion
with complainant and gave another cheque of Rs.3,00,000/- to him for loan to be
advanced by the complainant. However, again the loan was not advanced and
cheque not returned by the complainant. He admitted receipt of legal notice.
</p>

<p id="p_7">5.     The accused moved an application to cross-examine the complainant.
Complainant as CW-1 was duly cross examined by the accused. No other witness
was produced by the complainant and he closed his evidence by giving a
separate statement to this effect. Thereafter, statement of accused under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_5">Section
313</a> Cr.P.C. was recorded in which all the incriminating evidence were put to him
to which accused stated that he had taken loan of Rs.1,00,000/- from the
complainant in December, 2016. Cheque in question was given           as security
cheque towards repayment of loan alongwith interest, to complainant. He stated
that he had otherwise repaid full amount of loan to the complainant. However, the
cheque was not returned to him. He accepted receipt of legal demand notice.
</p>

<p id="p_8">6.     Accused preferred to lead evidence in his defence and had examined
himself as DW-1. The witness was cross-examined by counsel for complainant.
The accused did not examine any other witness and vide his statement, defence
evidence was closed.
</p>

<p id="p_9">7.     Thereafter, matter was listed for final arguments. It was argued by the Ld.
</p>

<p id="p_10">Rakesh Kumar Sharma Vs. Dhananjay Kumar Tiwari   CC No. 21015/17     Page no. 3 of 10
 counsel for the complainant that this is a fit case for conviction of the accused as
all the essential ingredients of <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_6">Section 138</a> of the Act read with <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_7">Section 139</a> of the
Act have been fulfilled and that the same has been aptly demonstrated by the
complainant before the court. It was argued that accused admitted his signatures
on the cheque as well as filling the details of the same, in his plea of defence
recorded at the time of framing of notice under <a href="/doc/429078/" id="a_8">Section 251</a> Cr.P.C as well as in
his statement U/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_9">Cr.P.C</a>. He argued that accused never gave reply to the
legal demand notice. He also argued that as per version of accused, the loan
taken from the complainant had been repaid by him, however, accused did not
produce any proof of said repayment. He also argued that accused never filed a
complaint against the complainant for misuse of the cheque in question. It was
argued that accused failed to raise the probable defence to disprove the case of
complainant and to rebut the presumption under <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_10">Section 139</a> NI Act. Therefore,
accused be convicted for the offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_11">Section 138</a> of the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_11">8.     Per contra, on behalf of accused, Ld. Counsel reiterated the submissions
made by accused in his plea of defence at the time of framing of notice under
<a href="/doc/429078/" id="a_12">Section 251</a> Cr.P.C and in his statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_13">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. that the
amount of Rs. 1 lacs of loan was taken by him from complainant was returned to
him alongwith interest. He further argued that cheque in question given as
security cheque was misused by the complainant. He argued that evidence of
complainant suffered from material lapses and was not sufficient to establish the
case against accused. He submitted that complainant has failed to prove his case
beyond reasonable doubt and accused is entitled to be acquitted of offence u/s
138 of the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_12">9.     I have perused the entire record as well as evidence led by the complainant
as well as by the accused.
</p>

<p id="p_13">10.    Before appreciating the facts of the case in detail for the purpose of
decision, let relevant position of law be discussed first:-
</p><p id="p_14">       For the offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_14">Section 138</a> of the Act to be made out against the


Rakesh Kumar Sharma Vs. Dhananjay Kumar Tiwari    CC No. 21015/17      Page no. 4 of 10
 accused, the complainant must prove the following points, that:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      1. the accused issued a cheque on account maintained by him with a bank.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      2. the said cheque had been issued in discharge, in whole or in part, of any
         legal debt or other liability.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      3. the said cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of three
         months from the date of cheque or within the period of its validity.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      4. the aforesaid cheque, when presented for encashment, was returned
         unpaid/dishonoured.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      5. the payee of the cheque issued a legal notice of demand to the drawer
         within 30 days from the receipt of information by him from the bank
         regarding the return of the cheque.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">      6. the drawer of the cheque failed to make the payment within 15 days of the
         receipt of aforesaid legal notice of demand.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_15">11.      <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_15">The Act</a> raises two presumptions in favour of the holder of the cheque i.e.
Complainant in the present case; firstly, in regard to the passing of consideration
as contained in <a href="/doc/517539/" id="a_16">Section 118</a> (a) and secondly, a presumption that the holder of
cheque receiving the same of the nature referred to in <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_17">Section 139</a> discharged in
whole or in part any debt or other liability.
</p><p id="p_16">         <a href="/doc/517539/" id="a_18">Section 118</a> of the N.I Act provides :
</p><p id="p_17">         "Presumptions as to negotiable instruments: Until the contrary is proved,
         the    following presumptions shall be made: (a) of consideration - that
         every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for consideration, and
         that every    such instrument,  when it has been accepted, indorsed,
         negotiated or transferred was accepted, indorsed, negotiated or
         transferred for consideration;"
</p>
<p id="p_18">         <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_19">Section 139</a> of the N.I Act further provides as follows:
</p><p id="p_19">         "Presumption in favour of holder - it shall be presumed, unless the contrary
         is proved, that the holder of a cheque received the cheque of the nature
         referred to in <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_20">Section 138</a> for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any
         debt or other liability".
</p>
<p id="p_20">12.      For the offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_21">Section 138</a> of the Act, the presumptions under
<a href="/doc/1177058/" id="a_22">Sections 118(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_23">139</a> have to be compulsory raised as soon as execution of



Rakesh Kumar Sharma Vs. Dhananjay Kumar Tiwari     CC No. 21015/17        Page no. 5 of 10
 cheque by accused is admitted or proved by the complainant and thereafter
burden is shifted to accused to prove otherwise. These presumptions shall be
rebutted only when the contrary is proved by the accused, that is, the cheque was
not issued for consideration and in discharge of any debt or liability etc. A
presumption is not in itself evidence but only makes a prima facie case for a party
for whose benefit it exists. Presumptions both under <a href="/doc/517539/" id="a_24">Sections 118</a> and <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_25">139</a> are
rebuttable in nature. Same was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in
<a href="/doc/441929/" id="a_26">Hiten P. Dalal v. Bratindranath Banerjee</a> [(2001) 6 SCC 16].
</p>

<p id="p_21">13.    In the present case, accused has admitted his signatures on the cheque in
question as well as filling in all the details, in the notice U/s 251 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_27">Cr.P.C</a> and in his
statement U/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_28">Cr.P.C</a> and also in defence evidence. Reference can be made
to Judgment of Apex Court in <a href="/doc/150051/" id="a_29">Rangappa v. Mohan</a>, AIR 2010 SC 1898,that,
       "Once the cheque relates to the account of the accused and he accepts
       and admits the signatures on the said cheque, then initial presumption
       as contemplated under <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_30">Section 139</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act has
       to be raised by the Court in favour of the complainant."
</p>
<p id="p_22">       Also in the case of K. Bhaskaran Vs. Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan 1999 (4)
RCR (Criminal) 309, it has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       "As the signature in the cheque is admitted to be that of the accused, the
       presumption envisaged in Section 118 of the Act can legally be
       inferred that the cheque was made or drawn for consideration on the
       date which the cheque bears. Section 139 of the Act enjoins on the
       court to presume that the holder of the cheque received it for the
       discharge of any debt or liability."</blockquote>


<p id="p_23">       It has been held in <a href="/doc/363129/" id="a_31">M/s. Kumar Exports v. M/s. Sharma Carpets</a>, [2009
A.I.R. (SC) 1518] that the accused may rebut these presumptions by leading
direct evidence and in some and exceptional cases, from the case set out by the
complainant, that is, the averments in the complaint, the case set out in the
statutory notice and evidence adduced by the complainant during the trial.
Further, the burden may be discharged by the accused by showing
preponderance of probabilities and the onus on the accused is not as heavy as it
is on the complainant to prove his case. In light of aforestated legal position, let us


Rakesh Kumar Sharma Vs. Dhananjay Kumar Tiwari   CC No. 21015/17         Page no. 6 of 10
 carry out a scrutiny of the evidence led at the trial.
</p>

<p id="p_24">14.    In the present case, the complainant by way of an affidavit led his own
evidence testifying that cheque was issued to him after he had advanced loan of
Rs. 4,30,000/- to the accused. The cheque in question, dishonour memo of the
cheque and legal demand notice were exhibited on record.
</p>

<p id="p_25">15.    It is the principle defence of accused as brought from his testimony as
DW-1, that he had taken loan of Rs.1,00,000/- only from the complainant in
December, 2016. It is his defence that cheque in question was given by him to
complainant after filling in all the details except the date, as security for repayment
of loan alongwith interest i.e. total of Rs.1,30,000/-. It is also his defence that he
repaid principle amount of loan of Rs.1,00,000/- alongwith interest of Rs.15,000/-
to complainant in cash. However, the cheque was not returned to him and
misused by the complainant.
</p>

<p id="p_26">16.    However, perusal of evidence reveals that this version of accused is not
supported by any material on record. In his cross examination, accused admitted
that he did not have any receipt regarding alleged cash repayment of
Rs.1,15,000/- to the complainant. Moreover, in cross-examination of complainant,
nothing could be elicited to cast doubt on his version or on credibility of the
witness. Therefore the defence of repayment of loan is totally unsubstantiated by
any evidence, and not credible.
</p>

<p id="p_27">17.    Accused also admitted in his cross-examination, that he had not filed any
complaint against complainant till date for misuse of cheque in question nor did he
give any written intimation or letter to the complainant for non returning of his
cheque. Also the cheque in question has been dishonored vide cheque returning
memo dated 15.06.2015 for reason "Insufficient Funds" '(Ex. CW-1/2) and not
for any other reason. There is no explanation or evidence as to why, if the cheque
was not returned to the accused even after repayment in cash, stop payment
instructions were not issued by accused to bank. Also the accused in answer to


Rakesh Kumar Sharma Vs. Dhananjay Kumar Tiwari    CC No. 21015/17        Page no. 7 of 10
 notice u/s 251 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_32">Cr.P.C</a>. admitted to filling in all the details, in the cheque in
question. In light of above, this court is of the view that simple averment of misuse
of the cheque is not a credible defence.
</p>

<p id="p_28">18.    It is also pertinent to note that the defence taken by the accused in answer
to notice U/s 251 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_33">Cr.P.C</a> was that the loans of Rs.1,00,000/- and Rs. 3,00,000/-
were never advanced to him by the complainant and only the fully filled up
cheques for repayment given in advance were misused. Even this version of
accused does not seem credible as no reasonably prudent person would give
cheques for repayment of loan which is yet to be advanced. In the ordinary course
of human conduct, a person would issue a cheque for repayment only after or
contemporaneous to the actual advance of loan to him.
</p><p id="p_29">       Moreover, during trial, accused took a different stand that loan of
Rs.1,00,000/- was actually advanced to him by the complainant which was repaid
by accused in cash. Both the pleas are inconsistent and raise doubt as to
credibility of version of accused.
</p>

<p id="p_30">19.    Even otherwise, if for the sake of argument, it is considered that the
accused gave a signed cheque, without writing the date, to the complainant, once
accused has admitted his signatures on the cheque he cannot escape his liability
on the ground that some of the particulars have not been filled in by him, or that
signatures on cheque and the contents are filled in different writings and inks.
When such a cheque containing blanks is signed and handed over, it means that
the person signing it has given implied authority to the holder of the cheque, to fill
up the blank which he has left. It has been clearly laid down in <a href="/doc/232831/" id="a_34">Section 20</a> of
Negotiable Instruments Act 1881, that where one person signs and delivers to
another a Negotiable Instrument either wholly blank or having written thereon an
incomplete negotiable instrument, he thereby gives, "prima facie authority to the
holder thereof to make or complete, as the case maybe, upon it a negotiable
instrument". In the case of Satish Jayantilal Shah v. Pankaj Mashruwala and
Anr.   1996 Cri. L. J. 3099, it has been held that:

       "no law provides that in case of any negotiable instruments entire body has
to be written by maker or drawer only."
</p>
<p id="p_32">          In the case of Moideen v. Johny 2006 (2) DCR 421, it has been held that
when a blank cheque is issued, the drawer gives an authority to the person to
whom it is issued, to fill it up at the appropriate stage with necessary entries and
to present it to the bank. Thus, the accused can not dispute the contents of the
cheque in question.

<p id="p_33">20.       The accused has also admitted in the notice U/s 251 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_35">Cr.P.C</a> and in his
statement U/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_36">Cr.P.C</a> that legal demand notice under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_37">section 138</a> of the Act
was received by him.
</p><p id="p_34">          Therefore, the legal notice stood served upon the accused but no payment
was made despite the service nor any reply sent to the same. <a href="/doc/150051/" id="a_38">In Rangappa v.
Mohan</a> (supra), the Apex Court held:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">          "Furthermore, the very fact that the accused had failed to reply to the
          statutory notice under Section 138 of the Act leads to the inference that
          there was merit in the complainant's version."
</blockquote><p id="p_35">The decisions in <a href="/doc/165232986/" id="a_39">Santosh Mittal v. Sudha Dayal</a>, 2014 (8) AD (Delhi) 268, and
<a href="/doc/127077568/" id="a_40">G.L. Sharma v. Hemant Kishor</a> 2015 (2) AD (Delhi) 340, are also to the same
effect.
</p>

<p id="p_36">21.       In view of the above, this court is of the considered opinion that apart from
not raising a probable defence, the accused was not able to contest the existence
of a legally enforceable debt or liability. The complaint disclosed the existence of a
legally enforceable debt or liability vide the cheque in question, return memo and
the legal notice brought on record. However, accused failed to rebut the
presumption in favour of complainant either on the basis of other material
available on record or by adducing any defence evidence. There is sufficient
material on record to conclude that complainant has successfully proved his case
beyond reasonable doubt.
