REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PETITIONERS THE LAST OF WHICH
BEING VIDE ANNX-E1 TO E19 FOR PURPOSE OF DE-
NOTIFICATION OR/RELEASE/ALLOT THE SITES FORMED IN SY
NO.28/3, 28/4, 28/5 AND 29/10 (NEW NO.52, 53, 54 &amp; 47) ALL
SITUATED IN GIDADAKONENAHALLI VILLAGE, YESHWANTHPUR

608 AND ETC.


     THESE PETITIONS COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS DAY,
THE COURT PASSED THE FOLLOWING:



                       ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Learned Government Advocate to accept notice for

respondent No.1. Sri K. Krishna, learned counsel to

accept notice for respondent Nos.2 and 3. They are

permitted to file their Vakalath/Memo of appearance in

four weeks.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.    The petitioners are before this Court seeking

for issue of mandamus to direct respondents No.1 and 2
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                7</span>

to consider their applications and representations which

have been referred to in these petitions and produced at

Annexure-E series.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">       3.    The case of the petitioners is that they are all

purchasers of sites in the private layout              formed in

Sy.Nos.28/3, 28/4, 28/5 and 28/10 (New Nos.52, 53,

54 and 57) situated at Gidadakonenahalli Village,

Yeshwanthpur Hobli, Bangalore North Taluk.                    The

lands in the said area had been notified and acquired by

the    second     respondent         for   formation     of   Sir

M.Vishveshwaraiah Layout. The petitioners are stated

to    have   assailed   the   said    acquisition   notification

unsuccessfully.     Similarly, several persons who had

owned sites and lands in the said area had questioned

the acquisition notification before this Court and this

Court while considering and disposing of writ petitions

in W.P.No.47917/2003 and connected petitions on

16.12.2005 known as Junjamma's case had issued

directions with regard to the manner of consideration of

the rights of the parties who had already possessed sites
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                             8</span>

which had been purchased by private transactions.

Similarly, certain other persons who are stated to be

similarly placed as that of the petitioners were also

before this Court in W.P.Nos.10416-535/2013 disposed

of 27.03.2013 claiming benefit of the directions issued

in Junjamma's case. This Court on taking note of the

directions    issued   in   W.P.Nos.47917/2003           and

connected matters dated 16.12.2005 (Junjamma's case)

was of the view that since there is already a direction

issued by this Court, all similar placed persons would

be benefited by such direction and therefore, the

petitions came to be disposed of. The petitioners in that

background are contending that they are similarly

placed persons and therefore, their representations at

'E' series which have been submitted to the second

respondent also requires consideration.


</p><p id="p_6">     4.      Learned   counsel   for   the   2nd   and   3rd

respondents, at this juncture, would point out that

though such contentions have been urged by the

petitioners, no opinion could be expressed at this stage
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                9</span>

since several factual aspects are to be verified and only

if the petitioners are similarly placed the other aspects

would arise for consideration.         To that extent the

representations will be examined.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">     5.   Having taken note of the said submissions of

the learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd respondents, I

am of the opinion that in the circumstance where the

petitioners    are    before   this   Court    seeking   for

consideration of their representations in accordance

with the earlier directions, certainly, the 2nd and 3rd

respondents would also be entitled to look into these

aspects   of    the    matters     while   considering   the

representations of the petitioners as to whether they are

entitled to the benefit of the order granted in the case of

<a href="/doc/1757978/" id="a_1">Junjamma &amp; others V. The Bangalore Development

Authority &amp; Others</a>, reported in ILR 2005 KAR 608 or

as to whether there is any legal impediment for the 2nd

and 3rd respondents to extend the benefit to the

petitioners herein.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                               10</span><p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">     6.     Hence, without expressing any opinion on

the merits of the claim made in the representations

submitted      by   the   petitioners,   the   2nd   and   3rd

respondents are directed to consider and dispose of the

representations in accordance with law taking into

consideration all aspects of the matter including the

above stated aspects.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     7.     To enable expeditious disposal of the said

representations, the petitioners shall now file one more

copy of the respective representations along with the

supporting documents, enclosing a copy of this order

with the 2nd respondent within four weeks from the date

of receipt of copy of this order.         The result of the

consideration one way or the other shall be intimated to

the petitioners as expeditiously as possible, but not

later than three months thereafter.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     In terms of the above, the writ petitions stand

disposed of.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">                                                 SD/-
</p><p id="p_15">                                                JUDGE
