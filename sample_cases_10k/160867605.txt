JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                        -2-</span>
</p>
<p id="p_2">            Present: Ms. Chetna Bhalla, ld. Counsel for plaintiff


            A registered envelope returned back with the report that despite

repeated information the addressee is not found at the time for taking the

postal article.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            At this stage, it is revealed that inside this envelope only one

paper appears whereas as per the postal receipt the weight including the

contents was about 19 gm and its postal charge has been paid Rs.50/-. On

one side of envelope it has been stappled. It appears that local postman has

taken out the contents of the envelope and delivered to the addressee and

thereafter it has been pinned up and returned back with the above report.

</p><p id="p_4">            Therefore, it is deemed that defendant has been duly served with

the summons. This is the suit for recovery of Rs. 3,19,832.51 on the basis of

agreement and Demand Promissory Note. Legal notice was issued on the

defendant dated 28.3.2007 whereby the loan facility was recalled and the

amount of Rs. 3,19,832.51 was demanded. As per the averments the same

has not been paid by defendant to the plaintiff so far.

</p><p id="p_5">            Defendant has not entered into appearance. Therefore, it is

presumed that defendant is not interested in contesting the present suit.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      -3-</span>

Therefore, the averments made in the plaint are deemed to be correct and

plaintiff become entitled for the judgment forthwith.

</p><p id="p_6">           I have perused the original agreement along with promissory note

and the notice whereby the claim of the plaintiff is supported. This suit is

accordingly decreed for a sum of Rs.3, 19, 832.51 with cost and interest @

9.5 per cent per annum from the date of institution till realisation. Decree

sheet be drawn. File be consigned to Record Room.
