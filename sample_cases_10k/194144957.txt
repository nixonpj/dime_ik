                              ---

       This Crl.CCC is filed under <a href="/doc/1923500/" id="a_1">Section 15</a> of the Contempt
of Courts Act, praying to take suo moto cognizance of the
criminal contempt, initiate contempt proceedings and secure
the presence of the accused and punish them for having
committed criminal contempt by taking a plea that
"Therefore the plaintiff has not at all taken the final decree
by furnishing the necessary stamp paper, which is executable
decree, hence the plaintiff has not filed the execution petition
to take possession of her alleged share. The defendants
have neither voluntarily handed over possession to the
plaintiff nor she has taken separate possession of her alleged
share by filing execution petition. Therefore the plaintiff is
not in possession of the suit schedule properties as alleged".
In para No.4 written statement filed in O.S. No.1323/2015
before the Hon'ble Civil Judge and JMFC, Belagavi, as per
Annexure-J which is contrary to the compromise decree in
RFA No.4161/2012 produced at Annexure-F, and abusing the
process of the Court.

      This Crl.CCC coming on for Orders this day, the Chief
Justice made the following:
                                    -3-



                                 ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      This is an application praying, before this Court, to take

suo motu cognizance of criminal contempt.


</p><p id="p_2">2.    In a suit for partition, the parties entered into

compromise. A decree on the basis of such compromise was

passed.      In     terms   of   such    compromise   decree,   the

complainant, who has been plaintiff in the earlier suit for

partition, got possession of the properties involved in this

application. It is alleged that the defendants, although had

entered into such compromise and in spite of passing of the

compromise decree, started interfering with the possession

of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">      Consequently, the plaintiff - complainant filed an

original suit before the competent Civil Court for perpetual

injunction. A written statement was filed by the defendants,

in this second suit, disputing the possession of the plaintiff.


</p><p id="p_5">3.    It is submitted that as the defendants had entered into

a compromise and are parties to the compromise, they have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    -4-</span>



committed contempt by filing a written statement disputing

the possession of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.    A request was made to the learned Advocate General

under <a href="/doc/1994908/" id="a_2">Section 15(2)</a> of the Contempt of Courts' Act, 1971.

The learned Advocate General by the order dated April 26,

2016, declined to grant consent.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.    This application is completely misconceived.         The

remedy of the complainant, if any, is before the Civil Court.


</p><p id="p_10">6.    We do not find reason to take suo motu cognizance,

inasmuch as we do not find any merit in the contentions of

the complainant.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">7.    The application is dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_13">8.    We make no order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
