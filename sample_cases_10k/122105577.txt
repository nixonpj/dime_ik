                  A.S.No.361 of 1997

                       JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Hariprasad, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">1. Appellant is the plaintiff in O.S.71/93 before the I

 Additional Sub Court, Thalasseri.     The suit is one

 for partition of immovable properties described in

 the plaint schedule.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">2.We heard learned counsel for the plaintiff and the

 senior counsel appearing for defendants 1, 3 and 13.

 Briefly stated, the averments in     the pleadings are

 as follows: The properties described in the plaint

 schedule originally belonged to one Eramullan.      He

 purchased the property as per an assignment deed

 dated 16.9.1940.   According to the plaint averments,

 the property was having an extent of 1 Acre and 1

 Cent.    There was a shed in the property.         The

 plaintiff would contend that Eramullan made an oral

 gift of the property in the name of six persons,

 viz.,  K.P.Aamu,  K.P.Moidu,   both  sons  in  law  of

 Eramullan,   P.K.Hamza,    the   son   of    Eramullan,

 P.K.Aysumma, wife of Eramullan and P.K.Abdulla Haji

AS.361/97
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             2</span>




   and    P.K.Ibrahimkutty  both  brothers  in  law   of

   Eramullan.   They started a business in the name and

   style "Deshi Commercial Textiles" as a partnership

   firm.     It is also mentioned in the plaint that

   P.K.Moidu released his 1/6th share in the property in

   the year 1952 in favour of P.K.Abdulla.  On the death

   of Abdulla, his 2 shares in the property devolved on

   his   wife  and  children,  viz., the  plaintiff  and

   defendants 2 to 12.    In 1960, Ibrahimkutty released

   his full right in favour of Aysumma. P.K.Hamza also

   released his half right to Aysumma and the remaining

   half right was given to K.P.Hamza and he, in turn,

   gave it to Sainaba, the plaintiff.   According to the

   plaint averments, the plaintiff is entitled to one

   half   share  exclusively  and 2  shares  along  with

   defendants   2  to  12  as  legal representatives of

   deceased Abdulla.    Other assignments were also made

   in between the parties.     Ultimately, the plaintiff

   claims 48 shares out of 384.    It is the case of the

   plaintiff that the defendants, who are co-owners,

   refused   to  share   profits for  six  years  before

   institution   of  the  suit.    Hence  the  suit  for

AS.361/97
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            3</span>




   partition is filed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">3.Defendants 1 and 3 jointly filed a written statement.

   According to the averments in the written statement,

   the suit for partition is totally mischievous and

   misconceived.  The extent of property shown in the

   plaint is incorrect.  According to the defendants, it

   is indicative of the fact that the plaintiff has no

   idea   about the  identity of   the  property.    The

   contention of the plaintiff that Eramullan orally

   gifted the property in the name of six persons named

   in the plaint is false.  An industry was functioning

   in a portion of the property is an admitted fact.

   But the property scheduled to the plaint never become

   the property of a partnership firm.    The plaintiff

   and the contesting defendants were never co-owners.

   The contesting defendants contended that after the

   death of Eramullan, legal representatives partitioned

   the property in the plaint schedule and alloted the

   same in the name of first defendant as item No.5 in I

   schedule of Ext.P13 partition deed. The plaintiff is

   not entitled to get any share of profit.   Therefore,

AS.361/97
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                            4</span>




   the defendants canvassed for dismissal of the suit.

   At the time of trial, Exts.A1 to A10 were marked on

   the side of the plaintiff and Exts.B1 to B91 on the

   side of the contesting defendants.  PW1 and DWs.1 and

   2 were also examined.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">4.Learned      counsel  for    the   appellant-plaintiff

   vehemently contended that the court below failed in

   properly considering the contentions.    According to

   the learned counsel, the court below should have

   found that the property was orally gifted in favour

   of six persons named in the plaint by the then owner,

   Eramullan and thereafter, a partnership firm was

   formed by them for starting an industry.      Learned

   senior    counsel  for  the   contesting  respondents

   contended that the oral gift is not proved and

   therefore, the court below is legally justified in

   dismissing the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">5.We     have carefully gone  through  the  evidence  on

   record.   Eramullan acquired the property as early as

   on 16.9.1940.     He died in the year 1950 is an

AS.361/97
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            5</span>




   undisputed fact.  When the oral gift in favour of the

   six persons named in the plaint was made is not

   specifically pleaded. PW1, going by his age, is

   incompetent to prove the oral gift.   At the time of

   the alleged oral gift, at the most he must have been

   a one year old boy.  Therefore, whatever that he has

   spoken to in respect of the oral gift is only

   hearsay.      There  is   no   documentary   evidence

   probabilising the oral gift.  Learned counsel for the

   appellant relied on Exts.A1 to A3 to contend that

   those documents clearly spell out an oral gift.  Per

   contra,    learned  counsel   for   the    contesting

   respondents would contend that what was released as

   per Exts.A1 to A3 was only rights in respect of the

   assets of the partnership firm.  It is the contention

   of    the contesting respondents that  there  is  no

   material on record to hold that the plaint schedule

   property was ever treated as the asset of the firm.

   It is pertinent to note that no document is produced

   to show that the plaint schedule property was ever

   made as the asset of the firm.  Even though there is

   a case that a partnership was formed by creating a

AS.361/97
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                             6</span>




   document, non production of the same is also fatal to

   the case of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">6.It is essential for proving an oral gift by a

   Mohammedan that there must be a declaration to make a

   gift,   acceptance  of  the gift  by  the  donee  and

   delivery    of  possession.    Without  these   three

   ingredients, no Mohammedan gift can be upheld.     In

   this case, there is no reliable evidence to hold that

   there   was  a  completed  oral gift  of  the  plaint

   schedule item in favour of the six persons named in

   the    suit.   In   the  absence of  proof  of   this

   fundamental   aspect,  none of  the  other  questions

   assume relevance.    To crown all these things, the

   properties owned by the partnership has also not been

   established.   These are the major flaws in the case

   of the plaintiff highlighted by the court below in

   its judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

</p><p id="p_15">7.After hearing learned counsel on both sides and on

   perusal of the materials on record, we do not find

   any reason to find that the court below committed

AS.361/97
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                            7</span>




   either factual or legal mistake in dismissing the

   suit. In the result, this appeal is dismissed.
