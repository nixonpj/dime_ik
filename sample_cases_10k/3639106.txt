                        JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     These Writ Petitions are filed challenging the order

passed by the Additional District Judge, Kottayam, in

C.M.Appeals filed against the orders passed by the District

Registrar (General), Kottayam under Section 45B of the

Kerala Stamp Act.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">     2.   The respective respondent in the Writ Petitions are

the purchasers under various sale deeds. The Sub Registrar

registered the documents and referred the matter under

Section 45B of the Kerala Stamp Act on the ground that the

market value of the respective properties was not shown in

the   documents.     The      District Registrar   held    that

undervaluation was made and the parties were directed to

pay additional stamp duty. Those orders were challenged

before the District Court in the C.M.Appeals referred to above.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">O.P.(C) No.488/10 &amp; conn. cases          2</span>




The learned District Judge held that the orders passed by the

District Registrar are contrary to law and set aside those orders.

The orders passed by the learned District Judge are under

challenge in this Writ Petitions.

<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">      3.     O.P.(C) No.37 of 2010 was filed challenging the order

in C.M.A.No.70 of 2008 on the file of the court of the Additional

District Judge, Kottayam. C.M.A.No.70 of 2008 was disposed of by

the learned Additional District Judge along with eight other

connected cases. A learned Single Judge of this Court dismissed

C.M.A.No.70 of 2008 holding that the order passed by the

Additional District Judge was legal and proper. It was held thus :



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                    "15.   The learned Government Pleader would argue

             that the word 'value' appearing in Sec. 45B is the market

             value and the District Collector is empowered to go into the

             question whether the amount set forth in a document for

             registration is less than the market value or not. Even by

             stretch of imagination, such a meaning cannot be attributed to

             the word 'value' made mention of in Section 45B of the Act.

             There can be no quarrel against the proposition that the

             registering officer shall always have the power to refer the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">O.P.(C) No.488/10 &amp; conn. cases           3</span>




             instrument to the Collector under Section 45B(1) if he has

             reason to believe that the value or consideration has not been

             truly set forth in the instrument. This Court in <a href="/doc/166606/" id="a_1">Rahim Baker

             v. Sub Registrar</a> (2001(3) KLT S.N.18, Case No.24) has held

             that the parties cannot escape from the clutches of this

             provision. Had it been the legislative intention to see that

             stamp duty is levied on the market value, the same would

             have been reflected in Section 45B. If the word 'value' which

             appears in Section 45B is interpreted to mean as market

             value, Section 28A of the Act would become redundant. The

             legislature intended, that for the purpose of imposition of

             stamp duty, a fair value has to be fixed. That is the reason

             why Section 28A has been introduced.            However, as

             observed earlier, there may be circumstances where the

             actual consideration passed would be more than the fair value

             fixed under Section 28A. In such circumstances the parties

             shall not be allowed to defraud the State Revenue by showing

             a lesser value or consideration in the instrument. In order to

             remedy such situations, powers are given under Section 45B

             for a reference to the Collector. Section 45B also envisages

             suo motu action by the Collector. That being the case, the

             market value of the property cannot have any bearing on the

             question.   The material to determine whether stamp duty

             levied is proper or not is the consideration which actually

             passed. So, when a reference is made under Section 45B, the

             Collector has to decide the true consideration which passed

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">O.P.(C) No.488/10 &amp; conn. cases          4</span>




             by virtue of the document under consideration and if on such

             enquiry, it is found that the true consideration which passed

             is more than what is stated in the document, the District

             Collector can levy duty. Under no circumstance the District

             Collector can take into account the market value of the

             property involved. Only on satisfaction that something more

             than what was stated as consideration in the document has

             passed from one party to other is the District Collector

             justified in directing to pay additional stamp duty.

             Assessment of stamp duty on the basis of market value is not

             at all envisaged by the legislature and a direction to pay

             stamp duty on the market value is incompetent as it is

             without jurisdiction and is liable to be interfered with."</blockquote><p id="p_6">



</p><p id="p_7">      In view of the judgment in O.P.(C) No.37 of 2010, I am of the

view that all these Writ Petitions are liable to be dismissed.

Accordingly, the Writ Petitions are dismissed.
