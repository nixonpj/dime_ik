         Cont. Case (Civil) No. 445 of 2010
Shri Umakant Chakravarty                    ...... Petitioner
                         Versus
The State of Jharkhand &amp; ors.               ...... Respondents
                         --------
</pre><p id="p_1">CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE D. N. PATEL
</p><p id="p_2">                         --------</p><pre id="pre_2">
For the petitioner:      Mr. Shambhu Nath Sharma, Advocate
For the State:           J.C. to GP-I
                         --------
                        th
Order No. 05: Dated 13 March, 2012
Per D.N.Patel, J.

</pre><p id="p_3">1. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the order, passed by
   this Court dated 16th December, 2009 in W.P.(S) No. 2366 of 2004 has
   not yet been complied with. Learned counsel for the petitioner has
   taken this Court to fine nicety of the facts and has submitted that
   paragraph nos. 9 and 10 of the aforesaid order are explicitly clear and
   they have not yet been complied with by the respondents.
</p><p id="p_4">2. It is further submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that
   against the order dated 16th December, 2009, passed in W.P.(S) No.
   2366 of 2004, L.P.A. No. 522 of 2010 was preferred by the State,
   which was dismissed by a Division Bench of th is Court vide order
   dated 6th July, 2011. Despite this dismissal order, the direction given by
   this Court has not been complied with. It is further submitted by the
   learned counsel for the petitioner that one S.L.P. No. 21822 of 2011
   was instituted by the State, which was also dismissed vide order dated
   6th February, 2012. Despite the dismissal of S.L.P., the respondents
   have not even finally calculated and sanctioned the amount, legally
   payable to the petitioner. The petitioner was ready and willing to wait at
   least for some time, but, the calculation ought to have been made by
   the respondents and it should have been sanctioned. A period of four
   weeks has already lapsed from the date of dismissal of the S.L.P. By
   the Hon'ble Supreme Court and, therefore, the respondents are liable
   for contempt of court.
</p><p id="p_5">3. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that they have filed
   counter affidavit and they are seeking two months' time to make
   payment to the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_6">4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that no such counter
   affidavit filed by respondent no.3 has been served upon the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_7">5. Having heard learned counsel for both the sides and looking to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                         2.</span>
        facts and circumstances of the case, it appears that the order, passed
        by this Court dated 16th December, 2009 in W.P.(S) No. 2366 of 2004
        has not been complied with, more so when the L.P.A. as well as
        S.L.P., preferred by the respondent-State, have been dismissed by the
        Division Bench of this Court vide order dated 6th July, 2011 and by the
        Hon'ble Apex Court vide order dated 6th February, 2012 respectively.
        More than five weeks' period has lapsed after dismissal of the S.L.P.
        Till today neither the amount legally payable to the petitioner has been
        calculated nor it has been sanctioned.
</p><p id="p_8">     6. If the amount, legally payable to the petitioner, has not been finally
        calculated and sanctioned, I hereby stay the salary of the Secretary,
        Food and Civil Supply, Government of Jharkhand, Ranchi, till the
        amount, legally payable to the petitioner is finally calculated and
        sanctioned.
</p><p id="p_9">     7. I hereby direct the Chief Secretary, Government of Jharkhand, Ranchi,
        not to pay the salary, T.A., D.A. Etc. to the Secretary, Food and Civil
        Supply, Government of Jharkhand, Ranchi, till the amount, legally
        payable to the petitioner is finally calculated and sanctioned.
</p><p id="p_10">     8. At the request of learned counsel for the respondents, the matter is
        adjourned to be listed on 9th April, 2012.
</p><p id="p_11">     9, Let a copy of this order be sent by the Registry of this Court to the
        Chief Secretary, Government of Jharkhand, Ranchi, through Fax.
