                               :2:




     This MFA is filed under <a href="/doc/1342622/" id="a_1">Section 30(1)</a> of            the
Workmen's <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_2">Compensation Act</a>, praying to set-aside         the
judgment and Order dated 8.2.2011 passed                   in
W.C.A/NF.17/2010 on the file of the Labour Officer       and
Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation, Haveri,         and
etc.

      This MFA coming on for Orders this day, the Court
delivered the following:

                          JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The appeal by the Insurer seeking reduction of

compensation        awarded   by    the   Commissioner    for

Workmen's Compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.    As there is no dispute between the parties

regarding injuries sustained by the claimant in the course

of and out of employment in a road traffic accident that

occurred on 12.2.2009 while he was driving the Car

bearing Reg.No.KA-05/N-1277, and the liability of the

insurer of the Car, the only point that arises for my

consideration is:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "Whether quantum of compensation awarded by the
      Commissioner is just and reasonable or does it call
      for reduction?"</blockquote><p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">      3.    After hearing the learned Counsel for the

parties and perusing the judgment and award of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              :3:</span>




Commissioner, I am of the view that the quantum of

compensation awarded by the Commissioner is not just

and reasonable and it deserves to be reduced.

</p><p id="p_5">      4.    As per wound certificate the claimant has

suffered the following injuries:

</p><p id="p_6">      i.    Injury to head.
</p><p id="p_7">      ii.   Fracture of left zygiomatic bone with fracture
            of left nasal bone.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      5.    The doctor has stated the disability at 40% and

the Tribunal has taken it as 35% to determine the loss of

earning capacity.       As the method adopted by the

Commissioner in determining the compensation is not just

and proper, I re-assess the same as follows:


</p><p id="p_9">      6.    The claimant was aged about 29 years at the

time of accident and        the Commissioner taking his

occupation as Driver, relevant factor as 201.66, has

assessed his monthly income at Rs.4,000/- which is just

and proper.    Considering the nature of injuries, justice

would be met if loss of earning capacity is worked out by

taking the disability at 25% instead of 35% taken by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               :4:</span>




Commissioner. Thus, the loss of earning capacity is

assessed as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_10">       4000x60/100x25/100x201.66=Rs.1,20,996/- and it

is awarded questions of law is answered accordingly.

</p><p id="p_11">       7.     Accordingly, I pass the following:

</p><p id="p_12">                             ORDER

       The appeal is allowed in-part. Judgement and award

of the commissioner is modified. The claimant is entitled

for   total   compensation    of    Rs.1,20,996/-   instead   of

Rs.1,69,394/- awarded by the Commissioner with interest

at 12% p.a. from 30 days after the accident.

</p><p id="p_13">       The Insurance Company is directed to deposit the

compensation       of    Rs.1,20,996/-     rounded     of     to

Rs.1,21,000/- with interest at 12% p.a. from 30 days after

the accident.
</p>
<p id="p_14">       The amount in deposit is ordered to be transferred to

the Commissioner for disbursement of the same infavour

of the claimants. The Commissioner after calculating the

amount payable to the claimant as per the award of this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              :5:</span>




Court shall refund the excess amount, if any, to the

Insurer.
</p>
<p id="p_15">     No order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                                    Sd/-
