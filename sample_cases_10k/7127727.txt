Mohd. Raja Usmani hereinafter called the complainant, to the police stating that 

on 26.11.2004 at 04:00pm, 14 meter cable wire was stolen from a theli (cart) 

outside 3 no. Electricity House. It is further stated that the complainant came to 

know   that   Gyan   Singh   and   Pappu   had   stolen   the   said   cable   wire.   On   this

 complaint, the present case was registered.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.     After   completion   of   investigation,   a   charge   sheet   for   offence   u/s 

379/411/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a> was filed against both the accused. Documents were supplied to 

both the accused u/s 207 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_3">CrPC</a>. The charges were framed for offence u/s 411/34 

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a> on 12.05.2009. No charge for offence u/s 379 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> was framed which amount 

dis charge of accused u/s 379 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.     In order to prove its case, the prosecution has examined only one witness 

namely   Retd.   Ct.   Subhash   Chand   as   PW2.   Summons   were   issued   to   the 

complainant several times but his presence could not be procured. 

</p><p id="p_4">4.     Ld.   counsel   for   accused   submits   that   the   matter   is   very   old   and   already 

sufficient opportunities granted to the prosecution, despite that the evidence could 

not be concluded. Today is the last and final opportunity, therefore, PE may kindly 

be closed.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.     Ld.   Substitute   APP   submits   that   one   more   opportunity   may   kindly   be 

granted.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.     Perusal   of   record   reveals   that   the   matter   pertains   to   the   year   2004   and 

already   sufficient   opportunities   were   granted   to   the   prosecution,   despite   that 

evidence could not be completed. Summons were issued to the complainant many 

times but his presence could not be procured. Each time summons returned with 

the report that complainant does not reside at the given address. Summons were 


FIR No.571/04 PS NFC                   State Vs Gian Singh &amp; Anr.                  Page 2 of 3 pages
 even sent through IO, despite that presence of complainant could not be procured. 

Last and final opportunity was granted to the prosecution on 02.02.2013 about 

one year ago but there is no clue of the complainant. On the last date of hearing, 

last and final opportunity was granted at the request of Ld. APP for the State. But 

today again, summons issued to the complainant is returned with similar report 

that he does not reside at the given address. In these circumstances, matter cannot 

be adjourned again and again for PE.  All other witness are formal in nature and 

no purpose would be served in examining them in the absence of the complainant, 

hence, PE closed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.     Prosecution has examined Retd. Ct. Subhash Chand as PW2 but   he only 

went alongwith the IO to the spot but neither anything was stolen in his presence 

nor recovered in his presence. There is no witness examined as PW1 and Retd. Ct. 

Subhash Chand was inadvertently given number as PW2. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.     There   is   no   incriminating   evidence   against   both   the   accused   persons. 

Therefore,   their   statement   u/s   313   <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">CrPC</a>   are   dispensed   with.   As   there   is   no 

evidence against the accused persons, therefore, both the accused persons namely 

Gyan   Singh   and   Pappu   Singh   are   acquitted   from   the   charge   for   the   offence 

punishable u/s 411/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a>.
