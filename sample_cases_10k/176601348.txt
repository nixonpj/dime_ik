<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">      3.   According to the petitioner, she is not in a

position to attend the Court at Kushtagi from Vijayapur

which is about 250 Kms. and she has no means for

litigation expenses. She cannot attend the Court alone

on every dates of hearing and contended that the

</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">      5.   Sri Babu H. Metagudda, learned counsel for

minor children and therefore, she is unable to attend
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                4</span>




the Court at Kushtagi on all the dates of hearing and

she has no source of income. Therefore, he sought to

allow the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">      6.    Per contra, Sri Deepak V. Barad, learned

counsel for the respondent contended that the petitioner

is attending M.C.No.108/2015 for last two years and

there is no impediment to the petitioner to attend the

Court at Kushtagi and this Court shall direct the Court

to dispose the same expeditiously. Hence, he sought to

dismissal of the petition.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">      7.    Having heard the learned counsel for the

parties,   there   is   no   dispute   with   regard   to   the

relationship between the parties as husband and wife.

The contention of the wife is that she had two minor

children and she is not in a position to attend the Court

at Kushtagi on every date of hearing.            Though the

learned counsel for the respondent contended that the

petitioner has no impediment to attend the Court at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                             5</span>




Kushtagi, the fact remains that the husband has not

produced any material before the Court to show that the

wife is capable to attend the Court at Kushtagi along

with her two minor children.     In the absence of any

material before Court, the said contention of the learned

counsel cannot be accepted.

under Section 24 of Code of Civil Procedure, in the case

of <a href="/doc/76774/" id="a_2">Seema Alias Preeti vs Promod Chandrakant

Vernekar</a>, reported in 2004(4) Kar.L.J.572, relying

upon the dictum of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case

of Sumita Singh Vs. Kumar Sanjay and another,

reported in AIR 2002 S.C. 396, has held that while

considering the application for transfer of matrimonial

proceedings, the convenience of the wife has to be

looked into while passing the orders under <a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_3">Section 24</a> of

Code of Civil procedure.
