</p><p id="p_2">      2.    Brief facts of the case are that about two years

back, the deceased Ramabai's marriage was performed with

accused No.1 and since then, she was residing in her in-

law's house leading happy marital life with her husband. For

about two months, she was treated properly.            There

afterwards, the father of the deceased died.    The accused

persons started giving ill treatment and harassment to the

deceased.    They abused her in filthy language.   When the

deceased gave birth to a male child, she was prevented from

feeding her child and they were telling that she could go for

doing coolie work and out of that, she could feed her child.

In her statement, which was recorded in the hospital when

she was admitted for burn injuries, she had clearly narrated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   3</span>



as to the ill-treatment and harassment meted out to her by

her husband and her in-laws and the other family members

of the accused persons.       She has further stated in her

statement that because of the harassment and ill treatment

and also because of accused No.1 who abetted her, she

decided to put an end to her life by pouring kerosene and lit

fire to herself.   Her son who came to embarrass her also

sustained the burn injuries. When the son of the deceased

was taken to the hospital immediately after the incident, the

doctor told that the child is already dead. The deceased also

succumbed to injures subsequently.            On the basis of the

same, the case was registered against the petitioners and

also the other accused persons.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">      3.    Heard the arguments of the learned counsel

appearing for the petitioners and also the learned High Court

Government Pleader appearing for respondent-State.



</p><p id="p_5">      4.     Learned    counsel       for   the   petitioners   made

submission that till the death took place, the complaint was

not registered.    It is also his contention that so far as the

petitioners are concerned, there is no prima facie material
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   4</span>



placed by the prosecution. The husband of the deceased is

in custody. So far as the statement of the deceased said to

have been recorded while she was in the hospital, there was

no endorsement or opinion by the doctor about the fitness of

the deceased to show that she was able and conscious to give

her statement.      It is his further submission that petitioner

No.1 is suffering from the ailments and in that connection,

the learned counsel has produced the documents along with

the memo. Hence, he submitted that in view of the materials

on record and as the petitioners are ready to abide by the

conditions that may be imposed by this Court, they may be

admitted to bail.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">      5.   Per contra, learned HCGP made submission that

two deaths in the family have been taken place and it is

because of the ill treatment and harassment meted out to the

deceased Ramabai and consequently, the son of the deceased

also died in the said incident. It is his further submission

that looking to the statement of the deceased, it is very clear

about ill treatment and harassment meted out to her by the

present    petitioners   and   her    family   members.     The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  5</span>



investigation is still pending at this stage and hence, the

petitioners are not entitled to be released on bail.



</p><p id="p_8">      6. I have perused the grounds urged in the petition,

FIR, complaint and other materials placed on record. I have

also perused the documents produced by the learned counsel

for the petitioners along with the memo with regard to the

ailment of petitioner No.1 herein.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">      7. Looking to the statement of the deceased Ramabai,

it is clearly narrated by her as to the ill treatment and

harassment meted out by her husband and also as to why

she had taken the extreme steps to put her life end. Even

the son of the deceased, who was aged one year, has also

died in the said incident. With regard to the submission of

the learned counsel for the petitioners that there was no

endorsement by the doctor about the fitness of the deceased

to give her statement and about her consciousness is

concerned, there is no requirement of law that there should

be an endorsement by the doctor and it is only the rule of

caution as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of

LAXMAN Vs. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA reported in AIR
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   6</span>



2002 SC 2973.           As submitted by the learned HCGP, the

matter is still under investigation and it is to be completed by

the investigating officer and charge sheet is to be filed.

Therefore, looking to the nature and gravity of the offence, I

am of the opinion that the petitioners are not entitled for the

grant of bail. However, liberty is granted to the petitioners

that after completion of investigation and filing of the charge

sheet, they may move seeking their release. With this liberty,

petition is rejected.
