<p id="p_1">            Applicant-wife, by way of instant transfer application under

Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure (for short 'CPC'), seeks transfer of a

petition under <a href="/doc/1284729/" id="a_1">Section 13</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 ('the Act' for short)

bearing case No.DMC/46/2017 titled as Vansh Vs. Salma filed by the

respondent-husband from Fazilka to Sri Muktsar Sahib.

</p><p id="p_2">             Notice of motion was issued.
</p>
<p id="p_3">             Heard learned counsel for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_4">            It has gone undisputed before this Court that the applicant-wife is

living with her parents at Jallalabad (West), which is closer to Sri Muktsar

Sahib than Ferozepur. She is also working at Jallalabad, District Ferozepur.

             In view of the abovesaid undisputed fact situation of the case, this

Court feels no hesitation to conclude that it is just and expedient to transfer the

petition under <a href="/doc/1284729/" id="a_2">Section 13</a> of the Act from Fazilka to Sri Muktsar Sahib. It is so

said because all the abovesaid undisputed facts clearly go in favour of the

applicant-wife and against the respondent-husband. In the circumstances of

the case, it will not only be inconvenient but would be very difficult for the

applicant-wife to go from Sri Muktsar Sahib to Fazilka to pursue the litigation

imposed on her by the respondent-husband under <a href="/doc/1284729/" id="a_3">Section 13</a> of the Act.

Convenience of the wife in transfer applications, like the present one, arising

out of a matrimonial dispute, is one of the relevant consideration. Further,

distance between the two places, financial status of the wife, her source of

income, her age as well as her responsibility for bringing up the minor child,

are the relevant factors to be considered, while deciding the transfer

applications like the present one.
</p>
<p id="p_6">             The cardinal principle for exercise of power under Section 24 of

the Civil Procedure Code is that the ends of justice demand the transfer of the

suit, appeal or other proceeding. In matrimonial matters, wherever the Courts

are called upon to consider the plea of transfer, the Courts have to take into

consideration the economic soundness of either of the parties, the social strata

of the spouses and behavioural pattern, their standard of life antecedent to

marriage and subsequent thereto and circumstances of either of the parties in

eking out their livelihood and under whose protective umbrella they are

seeking their sustenance to life. Generally, it is the wife's convenience which

must be looked at by the Courts, while deciding a transfer application.

following judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, as well as different High

as under: -

           imprisoned within a strait-jacket of any cast-iron formula

           unanimously applicable to all situations, it cannot be gainsaid

           that the power to transfer a case must be exercised with due care,

           caution and circumspection. Reading Sections 24 and 25 of the

           Code      together   and      keeping   in   view   various       judicial

           pronouncements, certain broad propositions as to what may

           constitute a ground for transfer have been laid down by Courts.

           They are balance of convenience or inconvenience to plaintiff or

           defendant or witnesses; convenience or inconvenience of a

           particular place of trial having regard to the nature of evidence

           on the points involved in the suit; issues raised by the parties;

           reasonable apprehension in the mind of the litigant that he might

           not get justice in the court in which the suit is pending; important

           questions of law involved or a considerable section of public

           interested in the litigation; interest of justice demanding for

           transfer of suit, appeal or other proceeding, etc. Above are some

           of the instances which are germane in considering the question

           of transfer of a suit, appeal or other proceeding. They are,

           however, illustrative in nature and by no means be treated as

           exhaustive. If on the above or other relevant considerations, the

           Court feels that the plaintiff or the defendant is not likely to have

           a fair trial in the Court from which he seeks to transfer a case, it

           is not only the power, but the duty of the Court to make such

           order."</blockquote><p id="p_10">

Subramaniam Swamy (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under: -

           "The question of expediency would depend on the facts and

           circumstances of each case but the paramount consideration for

           the exercise of power must be to meet the ends of justice. It is

           true that if more than one court has jurisdiction under the Code

           to try the suit, the plaintiff as dominus litis has a right to choose

           the Court and the defendant cannot demand that the suit be tried

           in any particular court convenient to him. The mere convenience

           of the parties or any one of them may not be enough for the

           exercise of power but it must also be shown that trial in the

           chosen forum will result in denial of justice. Cases are not

           unknown where a party seeking justice chooses a forum most

           inconvenient to the adversary with a view to depriving that party

           of a fair trial. The Parliament has, therefore, invested this Court

           with the discretion to transfer the case from one Court to another

           if that is considered expedient to meet the ends of justice. Words

           of wide amplitude- for the ends of justice- have been advisedly

           used to leave the matter to the discretion of the apex court as it is

           not possible to conceive of all situations requiring or justifying

           the exercise of power. But the paramount consideration must be

           to see that justice according to law is done; if for achieving that

           objective the transfer of the case is imperative, there should be

           no hesitation to transfer the case even if it is likely to cause some

           inconvenience to the plaintiff. The petitioner's plea for the

           transfer of the case must be tested on this touchstone.

2015 (Sushma and others Vs. Kapil @ Sahil Bansal) and TA No.797 of 2015

(Jagroop Kaur Vs.Varinder Singh Bhela @ Tony) which, in turn, were based

on the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, as well as different High

Courts, including this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_14">            Reverting to the facts of the case in hand and respectfully

following the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as

different High Courts, including this Court, it is unhesitatingly held that

applicant-wife is entitled for getting the petition under <a href="/doc/1284729/" id="a_4">Section 13</a> of the Act

transferred from Fazilka to Sri Muktsar Sahib, so as to enable her to pursue

the litigation without facing any undue hardship or harassment at the hands of

the respondent-husband. It is the settled principle of law that justice is not

only to be done but it should also appear to have been done. If the applicant-

wife is forced to go from Sri Muktsar Sahib to Fazilka, it would amount to

denial of justice to her. Thus, to strike a balance between the parties with a

view to do complete and substantial justice and proceeding on a holistic view

of the matter, this Court is of the considered view that it would be just and

expedient to transfer the petition under <a href="/doc/1284729/" id="a_5">Section 13</a> of the Act from Fazilka to

Sri Muktsar Sahib.
</p>
<p id="p_15">             No other argument was raised.
</p>
<p id="p_16">            Considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case

noted above, coupled with the reasons aforementioned, this Court is of the

considered view that instant transfer application deserves to be accepted and

the same is hereby allowed. Petition under <a href="/doc/1284729/" id="a_6">Section 13</a> of the Act bearing case

No.DMC/46/2017 titled as Vansh Vs. Salma filed by the respondent-husband

is ordered to be transferred from Fazilka to Sri Muktsar Sahib.

             Accordingly, the learned District Judge, Ferozepur is directed to
