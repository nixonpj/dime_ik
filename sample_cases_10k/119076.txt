ORAL
JUDGMENT</pre> 

 

 


 

 


 
	  

<p id="p_1">Petitioner
	is ordered to be kept on preventive detention by an order dated
	13.9.2010 passed by the Police Commissioner, Vadodara, in exercise
	of powers under Section 3(1) of Prevention of Antisocial Activities
	Act (for short 'PASA'). 
</p>	
	 

 
	
	  

<p id="p_2">Grounds
	of detention would reveal that there was one case of prohibition.
	Offence was registered against petitioner at Karelibaug Police
	Station, Vadodara on 1.9.2010. It is recorded that the petitioner is
	a head strong person engaged in selling liquor. To prevent him from
	such similar offence, it is required to be placed him under
	detention. 
</p>	
	 

 
	
	  

<p id="p_3">Counsel
	for the petitioner, however, submitted that that only for
	involvement in one case of prohibition, the petitioner cannot be
	said to be an antisocial element. His detention is, therefore,
	illegal. Reliance was placed in the case of Ashokbhai Jivraj @
	Jivabhai Solanki V/s. Police Commissioner,, Surat &amp; Ors.
	reported in 2001(1) GLH 393; wherein Division Bench of the High
	Court made following observations. 
</p>	

 

 


 

<p id="p_4">	"So
 far  as  the  cases against the detenu are concerned,
       they have already been registered.    They  were  against
      persons  mentioned  therein    which   is   stated in the
      grounds  of  detention  by   the   detaining   authority.
      Regarding  two  statements, having taken into account the
      law laid down by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1733535/" id="a_1">Ram  Manohar  Lohia
      vs.   State of Bihar</a>, AIR 1966 SC 740 and reiterated from
      time to time including the decisions referred  to  by  us
      hereinabove, the case falls under the maintenance of "law
      and order"  and  not  "public  order".    The  subjective
      satisfaction  arrived  at  by  the  detaining  authority,
      therefore,  cannot  be  said  to  be  legal, valid and in
      accordance with  law.      Since   in   the   facts   and
      circumstances,  an  order  of  detention  could have been
      passed by the  detaining  authority  for  maintenance  of
      "public  order",  the order deserves to be quashed and is
      hereby set aside.  The detenu is ordered  to  be  set  at
      liberty  forthwith  unless  required  in  any other case.    	Appeal is accordingly allowed.  No order as to costs".
</p>

 
	  

<p id="p_5">Counsel
	also relied on unreported decision of learned single Judge dated
	25.10.2005 passed in Special Civil Application No.18901 of 2005;
	wherein, it was held and observed as under:
</p>	 



 
	 

<p id="p_6">"6.
</p><p id="p_7">	  In the present case the reliance is only placed upon the solitary
	offence, without having any basis and dehors the relevant and
	credible materials to arrive at a conclusion about disturbance of
	public order by the prejudicial activities of the detenue and
	therefore, powers exercised by the authority while passing the order
	of detention is the result of non-application and the order of
	detention requires to be quashed and set aside. 
</p>	
	 


	 

<p id="p_8">7.
	For the reasons recorded hereinabove, the order of detention dated
	22.06.2005 passed by the respondent no.2, is hereby quashed and set
	aside. The detenue  Jyotiben Wd/o. Rameshbhai Morarbhai Koli Patel
	is ordered to be set at liberty forthwith if she is not required
	further in any other case by any other authority". 
</p>	
	 



 
	  

<p id="p_9">Learned
	AGP opposed the petition contending that order of detention was
	based on subjective satisfaction of the authority. 
</p>	
	 

  
	
	  

<p id="p_10">From
	the record, I find that admittedly, the petitioner was involved in
	only one case of selling illicit liquor. Except for recording of
	said FIR, no other cases are registered against the petitioner. He
	is not found to be involved in any other criminal activities so far.
	Judgments referred above would therefore cover his case. 
</p>	
	 

 
	
	  

<p id="p_11">In
	view of the above, I am of the opinion that order of detention is
	bad in law. Petitioner is ordered to be released forthwith if not
	required in any other criminal case. Petition is allowed. Rule made
	absolute accordingly.
</p>
