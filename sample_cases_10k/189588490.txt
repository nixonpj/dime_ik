</p><p id="p_3">2.           The Land Acquisition Collector (hereinafter referred to as "the

</pre><p id="p_5">4.           The petitioners admitted the statement u/s 19 of the Act to

the extent of Khasra numbers and measurement of the acquired land.



</p><p id="p_6">5.           The petitioners did not accept the market value determined

by the LAC and preferred reference petition u/s 18 of the Act.                   The

petitioners has taken several grounds against the award of the Collector

inter alia mentioned hereinafter.
</p><p id="p_7">                                   : 3 of 31 : LAC 19A/06 Ishwar Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. UOI




</p><p id="p_8">6.           The petitioners alleged that the no notice under <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_6">Section 12</a> of

Land Acquisition Act served upon the petitioners. The Collector made

award dated 24-10-2002 and at that time neither petitioners in person nor

through representative was present, therefore, petitioners does not accept

the award. The petitioners alleged that Village Dhool Siras is situated

within the municipal limits of Delhi state and subject to house tax and all

sorts of amenities like water, electricity and means of transportation are

available.
</p>
<p id="p_9">


</p><p id="p_10">7.           The Collector ignored the sale transactions taken place in the

Village or nearby villages, such as, Pochanpur etc. at the time of

notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_7">Section 4</a>. The Collector did not consider that land under

acquisition is surrounded by very well developed colonies and there is

tremendous appreciation of prices of land because of developed colonies

like Dwarka is touching the land of petitioners and the village is situated

within four main roads i.e. one Palam to Bijwasan, other Dhool Siras to

Bijwasan, Dwarka Phase I and Nazafgarh Chhawla Road.




</p><p id="p_11">8.           The Collector also erred in not considering the facts that the

petitioners' land is acquired for Dwarka project Phase II which is near to

railway station and Indira Gandhi International Airport. The Collector also

ignored the building potentiality of the acquired land which can be used for

residential, commercial and industrial purposes.
</p><p id="p_12">                                    : 4 of 31 : LAC 19A/06 Ishwar Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. UOI




</p><p id="p_13">9.           The petitioners have suffered a permanent recurring loss by

the acquisition of their land and they have been rendered job less as they

have mainly dependent on agriculture. It is prayed that determination of

the market value of the lands of the petitioners as compensation payable

to the petitioners may be done in accordance with the law.




</p><p id="p_14">10.          Union of India contested the claim and taken the preliminary

objection that Delhi Land Reforms Act is applicable and petition is time

barred. The land under acquisition is not surrounded by any developed or

undeveloped colony and used for only agricultural purposes. There were

no trees, well or tube well at the time of publication of notification u/s 4 of

the Act.    On merits, all the averments are denied.            It is stated that

petitioners are not entitled to enhancement of compensation and petition

is liable to be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_15">


</p><p id="p_16">11.          The Delhi Development Authority has been impleaded as

respondent no.2 as per directions of Supreme Court. Delhi Development

Authority also filed the written statement. The preliminary objection taken

by DDA is that the determination of market value by the Collector includes

the consideration of the sale deeds of adjoining village, amenities and

facilities and other circumstances and compensation is adequate, sufficient,

just and legal.   It is stated that petitioners are not entitled for grant of

enhancement of compensation and petition is liable to be dismissed.

<p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">14.           On the other hand, Respondent Union of India tendered

certified copies of sale deeds Ex. R-1 to R-18 in the leading case titled

"Ram Kishan and Others Versus UOI" bearing "LAC No. 79A/2006"

represented by Shri S.K. Solanki, Counsel for petitioners.



</p><p id="p_22">15.           I have heard oral arguments of both the counsel of parties at

length. I have gone through the record. My findings on the aforesaid issues

are as follows:-
</p><p id="p_23">                                   : 6 of 31 : LAC 19A/06 Ishwar Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. UOI


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">Issues No. 1 &amp; 2</span>



</p><p id="p_24">16.           Counsel for petitioners contended that LAC while fixing the

market value of the acquired land fixed @ Rs.13.82 lacs per acre on the

basis of minimum rates fixed by the Government for agrucultural land as

on 01-04-2000. The LAC erred in considering acquired land as agricultural

land and lost the sight of MCD notification dated 24-10-1994 by virtue of

which the village Bharthal declared as urban village.       He further pointed

out that the LAC did not consider the change of land use under acquisition

as per Master Plan which was modified on 16-10-2000 by virtue of which

land use was changed from agricultural to residential, commercial and

industrial etc.




</p><p id="p_25">17.           Counsel for petitioners contended that acquired land is the

part of Vasant Vihar Tehsil, District South West. According to notification

dated 16-04-1999 as per circular the residential schedule shows the rate of

Rs. 11,500/- per sq. meter and commercial rate of Rs.24,150/- per sq.

meter.   The pre determined rate for Dwarka Phase I land allotted and

auctioned by DDA shows rates of Rs.54,450/- per sq. meter and in the year

2006 plot of land in Dwarka Phase I sold for Rs.1,76,020/- per sq. meter.




</p><p id="p_26">18.           Counsel for petitioners contented that LAC should have

considered urbanization in the locality of the acquired land of the village

and development taken place in the surrounding area and applied the

method of determining the market value of the land as highlighted herein

above. The LAC did not consider the sale deeds filed by the villagers in
                                    : 7 of 31 : LAC 19A/06 Ishwar Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. UOI


respect of Village Pochanpur and Samalkha. According to these sale deeds,

total land measuring 42 Bigha 10 Biswa was sold for Rs. 16 crores.

Counsel for petitioners also pointed out the awards of village Mangolepur

and village Mohammadpur wherein market value of the acquired land fixed

after considering potentiality and method of grant of compensation on the

basis of sq. yards as acquired land can be used for residential, commercial

or industrial purposes.
</p>
<p id="p_27">

</p><p id="p_28">19.          Counsel for petitioners contended that while fixing the market

value of the land, the potentiality of the land in view of above highlighted

facts and documentary proof may be taken into consideration. It has to be

visualized that at the time of notification in the year 2000 what future

would be unfolded in the year 2008 while deciding reference under <a href="/doc/1517117/" id="a_8">Section

18</a> of the Act. There is no doubt that market value may be determined by

the Court as on 13-12-2000 but the reality and potentiality may be

considered. It is relevant to consider that Delhi has already been urbanized

and land on other other sides of the border in Haryana District Gurgaon

has been developed in colonies such as DLF, Palam Vihar, Sushant Lok,

various sectors under Haryana Urban Development Authority                    up to

Manesar and land between the said colonies and the land of the petitioners

were available for the colonization.
</p>
<p id="p_29">

</p><p id="p_30">20.          Counsel for petitioners contended that according to Master

Plan, there is provision for use of land contrary to the Master Plan. The land

falling under agricultural/rural use zone cannot be used for residential,

commercial and institutional use. However after various notifications which

value of the petitioners' land now falls as of urban land. Therefore, market

value may be determined as the value of urban land. The principle of

determination of market value of urban land may be applied and

development cost ranging from 1/3rd to 1/5th may be deducted.



</p><p id="p_31">21.           Counsel for petitioners further contented that the sale deeds

proved by Union of India Exb. R-1 to R-18 are inadmissible according to

<a href="/doc/176042882/" id="a_9">Section 35</a> of Indian Stamp Act. These sale deeds cannot be compared

with the sale deeds proved by the petitioners because village Salahapur,

Bijwasan and Rajokari are parts of green belt. The sale deeds of village

Dhool Siras filed by UOI are pertaining to the portion of the land which is

used only for agricultural purpose and falls under rural zone as per Master

Plan because vide notification dated 16-10-2000 the land use mentioned in

the sale deeds filed by Union of India        of village Dhool Siras was not

changed.     He further submitted that petitioners proved genuine sale

deeds, all notifications of Government, documentary proof of auctions as

well as cost of development and other criteria for fixing the market value

of the acquired land of the petitioners.

      agricultural or horticultural or other like purposes or was on

      used immediately or in the near future as land for putting up
      residential,   commercial,     industrial   or    other    buildings.
      However, the fact that the acquired land had been acquired
      for building purposes, cannot be sufficient circumstance to
      regard it as a land with building potentiality, in that, under
      clause (4) of <a href="/doc/1485112/" id="a_26">Section 24</a> of the LA Act that any increase to the
      value of land likely to accrue from the use to which it will be
      put when acquired, is required to be excluded. Therefore,
      wherever, there is a possibility of the acquired land not used
      for building purposes on the relevant date envisaged under
      <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_27">Section 4</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_28">LA Act</a>, of being used for putting up

      be said that there is the possibility of the acquired land being

      would be the real question. Such possibility of user of the

      it should be a matter of inference to be drawn based on

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">       "3. It is no doubt true that courts adopt comparable sales

       preferred than other methods of valuation of land such as
       capitalisation of net income method or expert opinion
       method. Comparable sales method of valuation is preferred
       because it furnishes the evidence for determination of the
       market value of the acquired land at which a willing

       in the open market at the time of issue of notification under

       are required to be fulfilled and on fulfilment of those factors
       the compensation can be awarded, according to the value of

       the date of issue of notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_30">Section 4</a> of the Act, (3)
       that the land covered by the sale must be in the vicinity of
       the acquired land, (4) that the land covered by the sales must
       be similar to the acquired land, and (5) that the size of plot of
       the land covered by the sales be comparable to the land
       acquired. If all these factors are satisfied, then there is no
       reason why the sale value of the land covered by the sales be
       not given for the acquired land. However, if there is a
       dissimilarity in regard to locality, shape, site or nature of land
       between land covered by sales and land acquired, it is open
       to the court to proportionately reduce the compensation for
       acquired land    that what is reflected in the sales depending
       upon the disadvantages attached with the acquired land."

comparison of sale deeds. In the absence of any direct evidence, the

Court, however, may take recourse to various other known methods. The

area of land, the nature thereof, advantages and disadvantages occurring

therein amongst others would be relevant factors for determining the

actual market value of the land. Evidence admissible therefor inter alia

would be judgments and awards passed in respect of acquisitions of lands

are after around more than 40 years of acquisition of land and

development of Vasant Vihar locality. The acquired land of petitioners

cannot be compared with locality of Vasant Vihar which is 40 years ahead

in development. The guess work to compare potentiality of Vasant Vihar

land with acquired land of petitioners in December, 2000 is beyond

comparison and contrary to the well settled principles laid down by the

Supreme Court.

<p id="p_66">37.          The second factor contended by the Counsel for petitioners is

the auction of residential and commercial plots of Dwarka Phase I. In this

regard, the demand of pre-determined rates and auction of plots by DDA

after development of the colony especially pertaining to the year 2003,

2004, 2005 and 2006, which are highlighted by the counsel for petitioners,

cannot be considered as contrary to the well settled principle of law by the

Supreme Court that the determination of the market value must be on the

day of notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_32">Section 4</a> of the Act. The Supreme Court in a

recent case laid down the principle on the proposition discussed herein

above in respect of determination of market value of the acquired land.

The judgments relate to village of Delhi state. In the case of Ranvir Singh

and another Vs. Union of India AIR 2005 Supreme Court 3467, the

Supreme Court held that :
</p><p id="p_67">                              : 21 of 31 : LAC 19A/06 Ishwar Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. UOI




"29. While adopting the said method, in our opinion, the High

Court committed manifest errors. The market value of fully

developed      land    cannot      be    compared       with      wholly

underdeveloped land although they may be adjoining or

situated at a little distance. For determining the market

value, it is trite, the nature of the land pays an important

role.
</p>
<p id="p_68">

</p><p id="p_69">31. The High Court did not consider any relevant criteria on

the basis whereof it could come to the conclusion that the

value of the freehold lands would be double of the value of

the leasehold lands. The fact that in terms of the brochure

the leasehold was to be a perpetual one and the ground rent

payable therefor was absolutely nominal being Re. 1/- per

plot per annum for the first five years and thereafter at the

rate 2Â½ % of the total amount of the premium, which was to

be enhanced only after every 30 years, was a relevant factor

which should have been taken into consideration for arriving

at a finding in that behalf. It is wroth noting that the terms

and     conditions    were   set   out   for   sale   by    the    Delhi

Development Authority on behalf of the President of India of

perpetual lease-hold rights in the residential plots under the

Rohini Scheme.

</p><p id="p_73">38.           In an another case, R.P. Singh Vs. Union of India and

others AIR 2005 Supreme Court 4189, the Supreme Court held that :



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_48">         "12. Contention raised by the counsel for appellant that they
         should be paid higher compensation because the respondents
         were now selling the land at the rate of Rs. 25 lacs per bigha
         cannot be accepted. Counsel for the respondent has brought
         to our notice that the land is now fully developed and for its
         development the respondents have spent a lot of money and
         the claimant would not be entitled to a higher price simply
         because after 40 years of acquisition and its development the
         land was being sold at a higher price. As already stated
         above, the market value of the land has to be determined as
         on the date of publication of the notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_33">Section 4</a>
         (1) of the Act and not as it prevails at a later date after the
         land has been fully developed."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_74">39.           The determination of market value of the acquired land on the

basis of methods proposed by the Counsel for the petitioners are not in

consonance with the principle laid down by the Supreme Court in the

judgments of Ranvir Singh and another Vs. Union of India (Supra)

and R.P. Singh Vs. Union of India and others (Supra).                  Hence, the

methods as proposed by counsel for petitioners for determining the market

value of the acquired land cannot be applied.

<p id="p_75">

</p><p id="p_76">40.           The notification issued for change of land use and notification

of MCD u/s 507 DMC Act shows that the Village Dhool Siras and Bharthal

ceased to be agricultural and comes within the urban boundaries of Delhi

State.   The Master Plan and notifications of Government             for land use

change show that in future the land can be subjected to residential,

commercial and other permissible uses. In case these notifications created

potentiality of the acquired land to use for building purposes then how

market value can be determined is laid down by the Supreme Court as

discussed herein above.
</p>
<p id="p_77">


</p><p id="p_78">41.          In the judgment of P. Ram Reddy and ors. (supra), the

Supreme Court cautiously laid down the principle according to which the

relevant date envisaged u/s     4 (1) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_34">Land Acquisition Act</a>, of being

used for putting up the buildings either immediately or in the near future

but not in the distant future, then such acquired land would be regarded as

that which has a building potentiality.      Such possibility of user of the

acquired land for building purposes can never be wholly a matter of

conjecture or surmise or guess.     The possibility of building potentiality of

the land should be on the basis of documentary evidence. In the present

case, the petitioners placed on record the notification dated 16.10.2000

for Dwarka Phase-II showing          change of land use from rural to

residential/commercial etc. Earlier notification of MCD u/s 507 of DMC Act

dated 24.10.1994.
</p>
<p id="p_79">


</p><p id="p_80">42.          The demand letters or auction rates of sale of plots at Dwarka

Phase-II after about 20 years of development cannot be the basis for

creating hypothesis of near future building potentiality of the acquired

land.   It is pertinent to mention here that the present land was acquired in

the year 2000 and proceedings under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_35">Land Acquisition Act</a> completed in

2002. The last five years show as per record there is no building activity

started at the acquired land, therefore, the building potentiality of the land
                                     : 24 of 31 : LAC 19A/06 Ishwar Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. UOI


cannot be termed as it is being used for putting up buildings either

immediately or in the near future. It is a clear case of building potentiality

in the distant future may be after 15 years or 20 years, therefore, the

acquired land as per material on record cannot be embodied with building

potentiality either immediate or near future.
</p>
<p id="p_81">

</p><p id="p_82">43.          Hence, on the basis of above discussions, as per principle laid

down in P. Ram Reddy &amp; Ors. Vs. Land Acquisition Officer (Supra)

by the Supreme Court, geographical situation and potentiality of the

acquired land of Villages Dhool Siras and Bharthal, it is not established that

the acquired land has building potential of immediate or near future. There

is no material on record to prove that even till 2007, the conceptual plan of

Dwarka Phase II has started any building activity.



</p><p id="p_83">44.          It is pertinent to mention here that the legislature in its

wisdom has taken care in respect of methods proposed by the counsel for

petitioners. The methods discussed herein above              for determination of

market value as per fully developed Vasant Vihar District locality or

demand rates or auction rates proposed by DDA in respect of Dwarka

Phase I. These methods are based upon the foundation of future

potentiality which is prohibited by <a href="/doc/1485112/" id="a_36">Section 24</a>. According to <a href="/doc/1485112/" id="a_37">Section 24</a>

(fifthly and sixthly) the increase for future potentiality the compensation

as    expression   of   the   statute   is   contrary   to   the   calculations     of

compensation.      The statute expressly enjoins to omit consideration of the

future use of the land or potentialities. The Supreme Court reiterated this

principle of law since the case of Narayan Gajapati Raju Vs. Revenue

Divisional Officer (Supra). This principle is also being reiterated in the

case of State of Orissa Vs. Brij Lal Mishra AIR 1996 SC 221.

</p><p id="p_85">45.         Now coming to the last contention of the counsel for

petitioners in respect of the sale deeds proved on record on behalf of the

petitioners. Before analyzing the sale deeds or determination of market

value on the basis of proved sale deeds by both the parties, it has to be

kept in mind the well settled principle in this regard settled by Supreme

Court. In the case of Narayan Gajapati Raju Vs. Revenue Divisional

officer (Supra), principle laid down that the best method as is well known

would be the amount which a willing purchaser would pay to the owner of

the land. In the recent case of    Union of India Versus Pramod Gupta

(Dead) by LRs. and others (Supra), the principle has been reiterated.

</p><p id="p_92">49.          The counsel for petitioners raised objection for admissibility of

these sale deeds as these are in contravention of <a href="/doc/176042882/" id="a_38">Section 35</a> of Indian

Stamp Act.   He also pointed out that these sale deeds are pertaining to

part of Village land which was never subjected to land use change and

remained as agricultural land. In my opinion, the certified copies of sale

deeds are permitted to be exhibited as admissible evidence as per <a href="/doc/1931419/" id="a_39">Section

51</a> A of the Act. The basic purpose of this provision is to have a look at the

prevalent market value of the land either of the same village or

neighbouring villages at the time of notification u/s 4 of the Act. The other

purpose is to see the projection of rise in land prices. In my opinion, the

sale deeds Ex. R-1 to R-18 are admissible for the purposes of reflecting the

prevalent market value trend of the land of same village or neighbouring

villages.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_49">          "if there is no explanation whatsoever for such a sharp
          increase in price of land in such a short time.         The rise in

          which is not the usual prevailing trend in rise of prices in the

          sale deed, therefore be relied on those instances for
          assessing the market value of acquired land."

<p id="p_95">(This judgment is in regard to Village Palam acquired vide notification
dated 27.01.1984 for Dwarka Phase-I).
</p>
<p id="p_96">

</p><p id="p_97">51.            The sale deeds proved by Union of India are showing much

below the market value from the willing parties in order to avoid stamp

duty by mentioning very low price as compared to sale deeds proved by

petitioners.    On the other hand, sale deeds produced by petitioners

executed in favour of Radha Soami Satsang Beas and other sale deeds of

Village   Samalkha    are   showing    the   trend    of   high   price    prevailing

approximately Rs.60 lacs per acre. The comparison of sale deeds shows

rising prices to the extent of 400 to 500 per cent. There is no material on

record to show or explain the comparative rise of price.



</p><p id="p_98">52.            In the present case, sale deeds of Union of India are showing

the trend of much below market value of the land and on the other hand

petitioners' set of sale deeds is showing a sharp increase in the price of the

land. Both the sets of sale deeds filed by petitioners and Union of India are

showing two extreme poles of price of the land. There is no explanation on

behalf of petitioners for this high price sale deed as compared to the sale
                                   : 29 of 31 : LAC 19A/06 Ishwar Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. UOI


deeds proved by Union of India. Even for arguments sake, the sale deeds

of petitioners belong to the area where land use was in change but it

cannot give rise to such a difference of 400-500 per cent increase in the

sale price.   These sale deeds are not realistic which reflect unusual trend

in rise of prices, therefore, cannot be the basis for assessing the market

value of the acquired land. However, the sets of sale deeds relied by the

petitioners and Union of India do not reflect the price of willing purchaser

and willing buyer of the land. Hence on the basis of above observation and

discussion, the sets of sale deeds proved by petitioners and Union of India

do not set the basis to determine the market value of the acquired land.



</p><p id="p_99">53.           Counsel for petitioners also relied on earlier awards of village

Mangolepur Khurd and Mohammadpur Munirka.              At the outset, both the

arwards passed by the LAC are not binding before this court.             Award of

village Mohammadpur is pertaining to year 2004-05. The another award of

village Mongolepur Khurd is in respect of 2 bighas and 3 biswa of land

located in Sector 2 Rohini which is already developed residential colony,

therefore, both these awards are irrelevant for arriving any market value of

the acquired land in the present case.

<p id="p_100">

</p><p id="p_101">54.           The market value is fixed by this court in the case titled

"Suraj Bhan and others Vs. UOI/DDA" bearing LAC No.136-A/2006

well the market value of the land situated in village Dhool Siras be

assessed after giving appreciation @ 12 per cent per annum for a period of

about 8 months 13 days, total 257 days to arrive at just and fair market

value of the acquired land. Accordingly by taking base value @ Rs.13.82

lakh per acre in block "A" and Rs.12.32 lakh per acre in block "B" on

01.04.2000 and by giving appreciation of 12 per cent per annum for a

period of 257 days, the market value of the acquired land would be

Rs.14,98,769/- per acre in block "A" and Rs.13,36,095/- per acre in block

"B".   It is rounded off to Rs. 15,00,000/- per acre in Block "A" and Rs.

13,36,000/- per acre in Block "B".       Hence, the fair market value

assessed of the acquired land on 13.12.2000 is                 Rs. 15,00,000/-

per acre in block "A" and Rs. 13,36,000/- per acre in block "B".

Both the issues are decided accordingly.
