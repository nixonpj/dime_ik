JUDGMENT
</pre>


<p id="p_1"> FIR No. 100/08 Unique Id no. 02404R0196032009                               1/6
</p><p id="p_2"> 1. The case of the prosecution against the accused is that on 15.04.2008 at about
   11.30 PM at NS Mandi near Pyaz Road, Azad Pur within the jurisdiction of
   PS. Adarsh Nagar accused was found driving Tempo bearing registration no.
   DL 1LV 9576 in rash and negligent manner and caused death of a person
   who was taking side of the road.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2. After investigation, charge-sheet was filed against the accused. The copy of
   charge-sheet and annexed documents were supplied to             accused     in
   compliance of <a href="/doc/1613898/" id="a_1">Section 207</a> Cr. P.C. Thereafter notice under <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_2">Section 279</a>/<a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_3">304A</a>
   IPC was framed against the accused to which he pleaded not guilty and
   claimed trial.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3. In support of its version, prosecution examined 4 witnesses. PW1 is Smt
   Geeta Devi, PW-2 is HC Parhlad, PW-3 is Ct Prabhu Shah and PW-4 is HC
   Sunil Kumar. It is pertinent to mention here that prosecution has cited only
   one eye witness i.e Geeta Devi who was examined as PW-1. She turned
   hostile in toto qua the identity of accused and the manner of driving of the
   accused. All the other witnesses are formal in nature as they were not present
   at the time of the accident and hence none of them could depose as to the
   manner of driving the offending vehicle by the accused. Hence no purpose
   would have been served in continuing the prosecution evidence as the other
   witness are formal in nature and their testimony would not have been
   sufficient for conviction of accused. In these circumstances the PE was closed
   without examining all the other formal witnesses as that would amount to be
   the futile exercise.
</p>
<p id="p_5">FIR No. 100/08 Unique Id no. 02404R0196032009                                 2/6
</p><p id="p_6"> 4.    After conclusion of prosecution evidence, statement of accused           was
     dispensed with as nothing incriminating came on record against the accused.
</p>

<p id="p_7">5. I have heard Ld. APP for State and Ld. Counsel for accused. I have perused
     the record.
</p><p id="p_8">6. The testimonies of PWs are being touched upon in brief, as follows:-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     6.1 PW-1 was examined by the prosecution as the alleged eye witness of the
     present case, but she had not supported the case of prosecution at all and
     turned hostile in toto and she deposed that accident did not take place in her
     presence and she had not seen the accused.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     6.2 PW-2 deposed that on 16.04.2008 you was posted as Duty Officer as in PS
     Adarsh Nagar and on that he received the rukka sent by ASI Paramjeet on the
     basis of which he recorded the present FIR ExPW2/A.
     6.3 PW-3 deposed that on 16.04.2008 he along with IO went to BJRM
     Hospital and met the Doctor of the hospital who declared injured as brought
     dead.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     6.4 PW-4 deposed that on 16.04.2008 he was on the patrolling duty where he
     received the information regarding the accident in question and thereafter he
     went at the spot where they found the eye witness Geeta(PW-1). Rukka was
     prepared and FIR got registered. Accused was arrested and thereafter was
     personally searched.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_9">7. It is the cardinal principle of Criminal Justice delivery system that the

FIR No. 100/08 Unique Id no. 02404R0196032009                                   3/6
    prosecution has to prove the guilt of accused beyond reasonable doubts. No
   matter how weak the defence of accused is but, the golden rule of the
   Criminal Jurisprudence is that the case of the prosecution has to stand on its
   own leg.
</p>

<p id="p_10">8. PW-1 Geeta Devi was the star witness of the prosecution being the only eye
   witness of the present case. She stepped into the witness box and deposed on
   oath that the accident was not occurred in her presence and she had not seen
   the accused. Thus she turned hostile qua the identity of the accused and the
   manner of driving of offending vehicle by the accused. When Ld APP
   specifically pointed towards the accused during her cross examination even
   them she deposed that accused is not the one who caused the accident. She
   specifically denied that the accused was driving the offending vehicle in rash
   and negligent manner and she deposed that she had not seen the accident. This
   testimony of the alleged eye witness Geeta Devi was fatal to the case of
   prosecution as there is not other witness in the witness list of prosecution who
   could deposed about the manner of driving of offending vehicle by the
   accused. None of the witness as cited by the prosecution could have deposed
   about the alleged' rash and negligent' manner of driving by the accused. The
   basis ingredient of <a href="/doc/1270101/" id="a_4">Section 279</a>/<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_5">304</a> A IPC could not be proved as the star
   witness turned hostile. The testimony of PW-2, PW-3 and PW-4 is not
   sufficient for conviction of the accused as they are formal witness. No purpose
   would have been server in further continuing the prosecution evidence as all
   the remaing witnesses are formal witness and their testimony would not have
   bee sufficient for the conviction of accused. The case of prosecution stands

FIR No. 100/08 Unique Id no. 02404R0196032009                                   4/6
      not proved. Prosecution failed to discharge its burden of proof.
</p><p id="p_11">           Accordingly accused Dinesh Yadav, S/o Amiri Yadav is acquitted from
           the charges framed in the present case.
</p><p id="p_12">           File be consigned to Record Room after due compliance.
