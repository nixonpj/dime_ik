              (SURESH KOL Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)


22-11-2016

Shri S.K. Kashyap, learned counsel for the applicant.
Shri Yogendra Das Yadav, learned Panel Lawyer for the
 respondent/State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">On due consideration I.A. No. 22272/16, moved on behalf of the
 applicant, is allowed and the documents annexed therewith are
 taken on record.
</p><p id="p_2">Heard arguments.
</p><p id="p_3">Perused case diary and material on record.
This is the first bail application filed by the applicant under
 <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_1">Section 439</a> of the Cr.P.C. for grant of bail in Sessions Trial
 No.453/14, arising out of Crime No.85/14 registered at Police
 Station Majhgawan of Jabalpur district against him for an offence
 punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Section 302</a> of the IPC, pending on the file of
 Additional Sessions Judge, Sihora, district Jabalpur, the trial court.
According to the prosecution, the applicant committed the murder
 of Smt. Maya Bai, W/o Sanju Kol, by strangulation on 07.06.2014
 between 10.00 a.m. and 7.00 p.m. on the outskirts of village
 Bhudhari ki Bhatiya.
</p><p id="p_4">Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant has
 been in custody since 08.06.2014 and that the prosecution case
 is entirely based upon circumstantial evidence. He submits that
 Bhikamlal Patel (PW-2) and Gajraj Singh Patel (PW-3) are the
 witnesses of last seen evidence but they have turned hostile
 before the trial court. After referring to the deposition of
 deceased's husband Sanju Kol (PW-11), he submits that he has
 admitted in para-12 of his cross that he committed murder of the
deceased being annoyed with her. However, on the another
breath, he resiled from the said statement. He submits that there
is no other circumstantial evidence on record to connect the
applicant with the murder of the deceased. He submits that the
prosecution has examined as many as 15 witnesses before the
trial court and now the formal witnesses are to be examined by
it. He submits that the applicant is a permanent resident of
village Majhgawan of Jabalpur district and that he has no criminal
antecedents. Upon these submissions, he prays for grant of bail
to the applicant.
</p><p id="p_5">Learned Panel Lawyer opposes the prayer.
</p><p id="p_6">On due consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case,
the submissions raised on behalf of the parties by their counsel
and after going through the depositions of all the 15 prosecution
witnesses, but without commenting on merits of the case, I am of
the view that it is a fit case for grant of bail to the applicant.
Hence, the application is allowed. It is ordered that applicant
Suresh Kol be released on bail upon his furnishing a personal
bond in the sum of Rs.40,000/- (Rupees forty Thousands
only) with one solvent surety of the same amount to the
satisfaction of the trial court for securing his presence on all such
dates as may be fixed by it in this regard. He shall abide by the
conditions enumerated in <a href="/doc/259682/" id="a_3">Section 437(3)</a> of the Cr.P.C. In case of
bail jump, the trial court will have power to cancel the applicant's
bail.
</p><p id="p_7">Certified copy as per rules.
