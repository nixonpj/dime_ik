application was allowed. However, on the date when his testimony
was to be recorded, he closed the defence evidence without

<p id="p_7">7.             I have heard final arguments addressed by Ld. Addl.
Public Prosecutor for the State and Ld. Counsel/Amicus Curiae for the
accused and perused file.

<p id="p_8">8.             On perusal of file, I find that PW-2 stated that he was
residing at E-49/A-91, Mazdoor Janta Colony, Welcome, Delhi
alongwith his family members. He used to install the cloth shop in
weekly market at different places on different days. On 13.01.2015 at
about 4.30 pm he was standing at Pili Mitti, 65 Foota Road, Janta
Colony. The accused Yad Ram @ Pattu who was known to him as he
was resident of same colony came to him. At that time he was in
intoxicated condition. He started demanding Rs.2000-3000/- from him
for meeting out his expenses. Since he was not having that amount,
he refused to pay him. On this, he started abusing him and
immediately took out chapar (a sharp edged weapon) and tried to hit
the same upon him. He had tried to save himself and in that process
he put his hand against the said weapon but the accused gave the
knife blow on the upper part of his right thigh. He also sustained
injuries on his right hand. Thereafter, the accused ran away from the
spot. At that time one Tausif who was residing near his house came
there and took him firstly to police station and on the asking of police
official, later on he took him to GTB Hospital where his medical

statement to the police. He proved his statement as Ex.PW1/A and
identified his signatures at point A. He remained admitted in the said
hospital and he was discharged on 18.01.2015. He had shown the
spot to the police and police prepared site plan at his instance. He

P.S. Welcome. Further investigation of this case was handed over to
him. He received the case file and perused the same. Thereafter, he
alongwith constable Sanjeev Kumar reached at the spot i.e. 65 Foota
Road, Janta Colony. He made efforts to trace the eye witness but no
eye witness met him at that time at the spot. He alongwith constable
Sanjeev Kumar went to GTB Hospital where HC Rajender Singh who
was initial IO met them and he handed over to him sealed parcel duly
sealed with the seal of MLC GTB Shahdara, Delhi which was
containing the clothes of injured Imtiyaz. He took the said parcel into
possession vide seizure memo Ex.PW1/C which was signed by him at
point C. Injured Imtiyaz was interrogated in the hospital by him. He

SC No. 47/15       State vs. Yad Ram @ Pattu         Page 10 of 21   28.09.2015
 recorded the statement of HC Rajender u/s 161<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10"> of the Code</a> in the
hospital. Thereafter, he alongwith constable Sanjeev Kumar went to
the house of accused Yad Ram @ Pattu as his address was available
in the statement of injured Imtiyaz. At that time, accused Yad Ram @
Pattu was not available. They came back to the police station. On
14.01.2015 he went to the hospital and deposited the MLC for
obtaining the opinion regarding nature of injuries. At about 6.40 pm,
he took constable Anand Beat Constable of the area and again went
to the house of the accused who was found available in his house.
He was identified by constable Anand. The accused was apprehended
and interrogated. On being satisfied, accused Yad Ram was arrested
vide memo Ex.PW5/A which was signed by him at point B. His
personal search was conducted vide memo Ex.PW5/B which was
signed by him at point B. The accused was interrogated and his
disclosure statement was recorded vide memo Ex.PW5/C which was
signed by him at point B.. He also led them to the spot of incident and
he prepared pointing out memo Ex.PW5/D which was signed by him
at point B. In pursuant to disclosure statement, the accused took
them to ganda nala (drainage), 65 Foota Road, Jafrabad for the
recovery of knife which was used in this incident. The efforts were
made but the said knife could not be recovered. Thereafter, they
alongwith the accused came back to PS. He recorded the statement
of constable Anand u/s 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11">Cr.P.C</a>. On 15.01.2015, he took the police
remand of the accused for one day and again came to the drainage
(ganda nala), 65 Foota Road, Jafrabad for recovery of said knife but
same could not be recovered. On 19.01.2015, injured Imtiyaz was
discharged from Hospital. He went to his house. He came to the spot

SC No. 47/15     State vs. Yad Ram @ Pattu      Page 11 of 21   28.09.2015
 with him and pointed out the spot of incident. He prepared the site
plan Ex.PW2/A at his instance which was signed by him at point B.
Further investigation of this case was handed over to some other IO.
He handed over the case file to MHCR.
</p>

<p id="p_19">18.             PW-9 deposed that on 13.02.2015 he was posted at PS
Welcome. On that day further investigation of this case was handed
over to him. He received the case file from MHCR and perused the
same. He find that result on the MLC was still awaited. He received
the result of MLC of injured Imtiyaz. As per opinion of the doctor the
nature of injury was grievous. He recorded the statement of witness
Tausif, HC Hemraj and supplementary statement of complainant
Imtiyaz.       He prepared the charge sheet u/s 307 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_12">IPC</a> against the
accused Yad Ram @ Pattu.                   He correctly identified the accused
present in court.
</p>

<p id="p_20">19.             During the course of arguments, Ld. defence counsel
submitted that there is contradiction on the point of taking of injured to
the hospital.      PW-3 Tausif claimed that he took the injured to the
hospital but MLC Ex.PW7/A contained in the relevant column as self
which shows that Tausif did not take the injured to the hospital. In the
MLC Ex.PW7/A it has not been mentioned that injured was assaulted
by accused Pattu. Had Pattu assaulted him, the injured could have
told this fact to the doctor and doctor must have written it in the MLC;
weapon of offence i.e. chapar was not recovered from the possession
of accused or at his instance; there are contradictions between the
statement of IO and MLC Ex.PW7/A as IO stated that injured was not

SC No. 47/15         State vs. Yad Ram @ Pattu          Page 12 of 21   28.09.2015
 under the influence of liquor whereas the MLC has shown that injured
was smelling alcohol; statement of injured is not consistent; it is self
contradicted; there are contradictions in the testimonies of PW-2 and
PW-3; and eye and material witness PW-3 did not support the
prosecution case. It has been submitted by Ld. Defence counsel that
prosecution could not prove its case against the accused beyond
reasonable suspicion and shadow of doubt and he is entitled for
acquittal.
</p>

<p id="p_21">20.            On the other hand Ld. Addl. PP submitted that the
contradictions pointed out by Ld. Counsel for the accused are minor
and the material and eye witness supported the case of prosecution in
examination in chief and that should be taken into consideration for
deciding the case and in cross examination they did not support the
case as the accused won over them; and eye witness Tausif
supported the case of the prosecution in cross examination.                 He
submitted that prosecution has proved its case beyond any
reasonable suspicion and shadow of doubt.                   It has also been
submitted that the accused can be convicted even on the basis of
testimony of hostile witness.
</p>

<p id="p_22">21.            On analyzing the evidence on record and considering the
arguments of Ld. Addl. Public Prosecutor for the State and Ld.
Defence Counsel, I come to the conclusion that prosecution has failed
to prove its case against the accused beyond any reasonable
suspicion and shadow of doubt.                 The reasons which support my
decision are firstly that testimony of injured is self-contradictory.
</p>
<p id="p_23">SC No. 47/15       State vs. Yad Ram @ Pattu           Page 13 of 21   28.09.2015
 Examination-in-chief of injured has already been narrated and
discussed in paragraph 8 herein above. In cross-examination he
stated that he took liquor even during day hours and on 13.1.2015 he
had consumed liquor and he was under the influence of liquor. Public
persons told him that he was hit by accused Yadram @ Pattu. He did
not see the accused hitting him. He explained that there was crowd.
He did not know if his blood has fallen down on the ground. He did
not tell the name of assailant to the doctor as the same was not asked
by the doctor.       He did not tell the doctor by which weapon he
sustained injury. He was having mobile phone at the time of incident.
He did not make call to the police by dialing no.100. Police met him in
the GTB Hospital at about 5-5.30 PM and then police made enquiries
from him. His statement was not read over to him by the police. He
did not know as to what was written by the police in his statement.
His mother came in the hospital at about 5.00 PM. He was alone in
the hospital when his statement was recorded. The spot of incident is
a public place and public persons were available there. About 20-25
public persons had collected there at the time of incident. Tausif came
to him at the spot within 10-15 minutes after the incident. The clothes
of Tausif did not smear with his blood. He admitted that he had given
the name of accused Yadram due to misunderstanding. The above
portion of the cross-examination of injured has shown that he deposed
contrary to what he deposed in his examination-in-chief.
</p>

<p id="p_24">22.            The     injured      was          re-examined   as     during    cross-
examination he disclosed new facts. He again changed his testimony
and admitted that he had stated in his examination in chief that the

SC No. 47/15         State vs. Yad Ram @ Pattu             Page 14 of 21       28.09.2015
 accused Yadram @ Pattu took out chapad and tried to hit him and that
he tried to save himself and in that process he put his hand against
the said weapon. The accused had given the knife blow on the upper
part of his right thigh and he also identified the accused Yadram @
Pattu and that he knew him being the resident of his area and that he
did not state that he had given his name due to misunderstanding. He
again changed his testimony and stated that what he stated on the
date of his cross-examination was correct. He also stated that his
statement which was recorded on the date of his examination-in-chief
was also correct. Thus, testimony of injured is self-contradictory which
has demolished the foundation of the prosecution case.
</p>

<p id="p_25">23.            Secondly, testimony of material and eye witness PW-3 is
also inconsistent. His examination-in-chief has been narrated in
paragraph no.9 above. In cross-examination he stated that he was at
a distance of 100 steps when he received an information about
sustaining of injuries by his friend Imtiaz. He did not know the boy
who gave that information to him. When he reached at the spot, there
was crowd of 30-40 persons. He did not notice blood on the ground.
He took Imtiaz to the hospital after about 5 minutes from the time he
reached at the spot. He explained that he brought his scooty from his
house in the meantime. They arrived at GTB hospital within half an
hour. He was having his mobile phone. He did not know if Imtiaz was
having mobile phone at that time. He did not make call to the police at
No.100 before taking Imtiaz to hospital. Imtiaz also did not make any
call to the police. Blood did not fall down on his scooty or on his
clothes. He explained that Imtiaz put handkerchief on his wound. He

SC No. 47/15       State vs. Yad Ram @ Pattu    Page 15 of 21   28.09.2015
 took him to the doctor who asked him to go out of the room. Police
arrived in the hospital after about half an hour. Police did not record
his statement. Statement of Imtiaz was not recorded in his presence.
Mother of Imtiaz came in the hospital. He did not see as to how Imtiaz
sustained injuries? Thus, he deposed in just contradiction of what he
deposed in his examination-in-chief as in his examination-in-chief he
deposed that accused hit Imtiaz on the upper part of his thigh and also
gave knife blow on his hand.
</p>

<p id="p_26">24.            As the witness changed material averments of his
statement, so he was allowed to be cross-examined by Ld. Addl.
Public Prosecutor. During cross-examination he admitted that he
made the statement before the police correctly. He explained that he
was answering the question which was being put by the police. The
statement which was given by him in the court on 29.6.2015 was not
correct. On 29.6.2015 the witness made his examination-in-chief and
incriminated the accused.           He further stated that he made false
statement on 29.6.2015 that he saw a quarrel between Imtiaz and
Pattu present in the court on the issue of money. He made false
statement before this court that Pattu was demanding money and
Imtiaz was saying that he was not having money at that time and also
made false statement that accused Pattu took out a Chapad and he
gave knife blow to the injured Imtiaz which hit him on the right thigh.
He stated that he deposed at the instance of police. He denied the
suggestion that he changed his testimony as he had been won over
by the accused. Thus, the material eye-witness even failed to support
the prosecution case in further cross-examination conducted by

SC No. 47/15       State vs. Yad Ram @ Pattu       Page 16 of 21   28.09.2015
 Ld. Addl. Public Prosecutor for the state.
</p>

<p id="p_27">25.            Thirdly, there are major contradictions in the testimonies
of prosecution witnesses. On examination of evidence on record I find
contradictions on the following points :
</p>

<p id="p_28">(i) Amount of demand
</p><p id="p_29">26.            In the statement Ex.PW1/A made to the police by the
injured/PW-2, it is stated that accused demanded Rs.4,000- 5,000/-
on credit from him at the time of alleged occurrence. In his statement
made before the court he stated that the accused demanded Rs.
2,000/3,000 from him for meeting out his expenses.
</p>

<p id="p_30">(ii) Use of Scooty for taking the injured to hospital
</p><p id="p_31">27.            In the examination-in-chief PW-3 stated that after the
incident he immediately went to the house of Imtiaz and brought
scooty no.1018 and took him to the hospital. In the cross-examination
he stated that he took the injured Imtiaz from the spot to the hospital
on his scooty.
</p>

<p id="p_32">(iii) Visit of police station soon after the incident
</p><p id="p_33">28.            PW-2 deposed that Tausif (PW-3) took him to the police
station firstly and on asking of police officials he took him to GTB
Hospital. PW-3 on this aspect deposed that he took Imtiaz to GTB
Hospital on his scooty. In the cross-examination he deposed that they
arrived in the GTB Hospital within half an hour. Thus there is
inconsistency in the statement of PW-3 in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_34">SC No. 47/15        State vs. Yad Ram @ Pattu       Page 17 of 21   28.09.2015
</p><p id="p_35"> (iv) Consumption of liquor by the injured
</p><p id="p_36">29.            In MLC Ex.PW7/A, it has been mentioned that injured
was smelling alcohol. First IO denied the suggestion that when he
met Imtiaz he was under the influence of liquor. He did not remember
whether fact of consumption of liquor was mentioned in the MLC.
</p>

<p id="p_37">30.            The discrepancies and contradictions in the testimony of
material prosecution witnesses as mentioned herein above have
created doubt on the truthfulness of the prosecution case.
</p>

<p id="p_38">31.            My decision finds support by principles of law laid down in
a case titled as <a href="/doc/338103/" id="a_13">Babu Lal and others vs. State</a>, 1994 JCC 111
wherein, the Delhi High Court observed that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        "10. As far as these appellants, namely Babu Lal, Arjun Das and
        Leela Ram are concerned, there are material contradictions in the
        statements of the two injured, Om Parkash and Bhagwan Das who
        are the real brothers. The other alleged eye witnesses have also
        contradicted themselves on the most material points and the
        contradictions cannot be said to be minor and have occurred on
        account of passage of time. Moti Lal, PW13 on whose statement
        the case was registered has also not supported the case of
        prosecution in as much as he has denied that he has seen the
        incident or he saw these appellants giving injuries to the injured.***
        There are serious lapses in the prosecution story in connecting
        these appellants with the offence. The story put up by the
        prosecution as far as these appellants are concerned, is
        unbelievable and doubtful. The weapon of offence, Rampi, was not
        sent to the doctor for examination, as such the doctor has not
        stated that these injuries could have been caused by the Rampi."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_39">32.            Fourthly, there was delay in reporting the matter to the
police. There was no prompt reporting of the matter to the police.
Both the material and eye-witnesses i.e. PW-2 and PW-3 were having

SC No. 47/15        State vs. Yad Ram @ Pattu        Page 18 of 21    28.09.2015
 mobile phones but they did not report the matter to the IO. PW-2 and
PW-3 in their cross-examination admitted that they were having their
respective mobile phones and they did not inform the police about the
incident. The police was informed by the duty constable at the
hospital. Not reporting of the incident by the injured or the eye witness
further creates reasonable suspicion and shadow of doubt in the
truthfulness of the prosecution case.
</p>

<p id="p_40">33.              Fifthly, in a case reported as <a href="/doc/1505859/" id="a_14">Sharad Birdhichand Sarda
v. State of Maharashtra</a>, AIR 1984 SC 1622, it was inter alia held by
the Apex Court that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                 "It is well settled that where on the evidence two possibilities
                 are available or open, one which goes in favour of the
                 prosecution and the other which benefits an accused, the
                 accused is undoubtedly entitled to the benefit of doubt."</blockquote>


<p id="p_41">                 The principles of law laid down in above case are
applicable on the facts of present case and therefore, it is held that the
accused is entitled to get benefit of doubt as in the present case one
leads to his involvement and other leads to his involvement in the
crime doubtful.
</p>
<p id="p_42">34.              Sixthly, in a case <a href="/doc/1025153/" id="a_15">Satbir vs. State of Uttar Pradesh</a>
1982 SCC Criminal 132 it was held when the prosecution has failed
to bring the charges home beyond the reasonable doubt, he is entitled
for acquittal.
</p>
<p id="p_43">35.              Lastly, the principle 'let hundred accused may go scot-
free without punishment but one innocent person should not be

SC No. 47/15          State vs. Yad Ram @ Pattu         Page 19 of 21    28.09.2015
 punished' is applicable in the present case. Therefore, it would be just,
fair and appropriate if the accused is given benefit of doubt as the
prosecution has failed to prove its case against him beyond any
reasonable suspicion and shadow of doubt.
</p>
<p id="p_44">36.            Before parting with this judgment, it would be relevant to
mention that eye and material witness PW-3 Tausif admitted during
cross-examination that he made false statement before this court.
Therefore, legal action against him is required to be taken in
accordance with law. Sh. Taufiq Ahmed, presently working in this court
as Ld. Addl. Public Prosecutor is authorized u/s 195<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_16"> of the Code</a> to
initiate legal action against the witness PW-3 Sh. Tausif as per law.
</p>
<p id="p_45">                                  CONCLUSION

</p><p id="p_46">37.            Consequent upon above reasons, discussion and
evidence on record and particularly discussed herein above, I am of
the view that prosecution has failed to prove its case against the
accused beyond reasonable suspicion and shadow of doubt.
Therefore, the accused is entitled to get benefit of doubt. Resultantly,
the accused is acquitted of the offence of attempt to murder
punishable u/s 307 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_17">IPC</a> .
</p>
<p id="p_47">38.            The accused is in JC. he be released forthwith from JC if
he is not required in any other case. Accused is stated to be in JC in
another case in which he is undergoing life imprisonment.
</p>
<p id="p_48">39.            However, if he is released from jail within six months then

 in view of provisions of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_18">Section 437-A</a> of the Code, the accused is
directed to furnish within a week bail bond/surety bond in the sum of
Rs.10,000/- with one surety of like amount for the period of six months
along with passport size photograph and document of identity and
residence.
