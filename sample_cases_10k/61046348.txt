<p id="p_1">             This Court vide order dated 19.12.2014 disposed of revision

petition bearing CR No.236 of 2012 preferred against the order dated

01.02.2010 and 16.02.2010 in the following manner:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             ''The said Board of Doctors consisted of Professor and Head of
             Surgery, Assistant Professor of Forensic Medicine and a
             Neurologist. There is absolutely no reason why the said report
             of the medical experts brought in evidence before the lower
             court, should have been ignored. Even otherwise, provisions of
             Order XXXII CPC were to be followed in letter and spirit but
             were given a go-bye. If some earlier court, without
             appreciation of facts and the application of law, has made
             some observation many years ago regarding soundness of


                                1 of 4

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CR-236-2012                                                                2</span>

         mind of the petitioner, the same would not act as res judicata.
         It is also not understandable as to how and in what
         circumstances the lower court gave its own finding that "the
         plaintiff seems to be a person of unsound mind" without even
         examining the plaintiff in the witness box.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">         Keeping in view the totality of facts and circumstances,
         impugned order dated 1.2.2010 is no order in the eyes of law
         and is sequelly set aside. The case is sent back to the lower
         court for deciding the application of Gurmit Singh for acting
         as next friend of Amarjit Singh and for filing the suit on his
         behalf afresh considering the medical report and if found
         necessary for personal satisfaction even by examining the
         plaintiff in person.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">         So far as order dated 16.2.2010 is concerned, it also suffers
         from inherent infirmity and illegality. Once vide order dated
         1.2.2010, application of next friend of the plaintiff to sue on his
         behalf, he being of unsound mind/lunatic, had been dismissed
         in terms of Order XXXII Rule 15 CPC, an opportunity was to
         be given to plaintiff Amarjit Singh to come forward to file the
         suit on his behalf or by himself and also then he was expected
         to sign the plaint and was also required to furnish affidavit, if
         any, in support of averments made by him in the plaint.
         Without providing any such opportunity to plaintiff Amarjit
         Singh, how he could have signed the plaint or could have
         engaged his counsel who could have then signed, only after his
         engagement in the suit by the plaintiff. Thus order dated
         16.2.2010 also suffers from major legal and functional defect
         and thus is set aside even otherwise when order dated 1.2.2010
         has been set aside, as a sequel thereto, subsequent order of
         16.2.2010 cannot stand independently and thus even otherwise
         legally is to go.</blockquote><p id="p_2">

               remanded to the lower court for deciding the application of
               Amrjit Singh to sue Sukhminder Kaur etc. as a person of
               unsound mind/lunatic through his next friend.

               13.1.2015.
</p><p id="p_5">               The petition stands disposed of accordingly."
</p><p id="p_6">               The review applicant/respondent(s) has preferred the present

review application by annexing the certain documents on the premise that

the issue with regard to unsound mind/lunatic of Amarjit Singh had already

been settled in various proceedings, much less, the application under Order

32 Rule 15 CPC, at the last stage of the suit, was not maintainable, thus,

there was an error apparent on record. The reference is also made to the

various judgments annexed with the review application.

</p><p id="p_7">               This Court vide order dated 09.10.2015 had issued the notice

and directing the trial Court not to pass the final order.

</p><p id="p_8">               Mr. R.K. Saini, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the non-

applicant/petitioner submits that there was no error apparent on record. The

order passed by this Court is most innocuous. The matter was relegated to

the trial Court to decide the application under Order 32 Rule 15 CPC afresh.

All the points, which has been raised in the revision petition, can be agitated

before the trial Court, thus, urges this Court for dismissal of the review

application.
</p>
<p id="p_9">               I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and appraised

the paper book and of the view that there is a force and merit in the

submissions of Mr. Gupta, for, on reading of the contents of paragraph No.8

of the application, whereby the issues framed in the suit have not been

controverted by Mr. Saini, the issue No.1 takes care of the apprehension of

                                  3 of 4

the plaintiff with regard to the unsoundness of mind.              The documents

(Annexures A-1 &amp; A-2), on record, reveals that issue with regard to

unsoundness of mind of Amarjit Singh had already been decided holding

that the plaintiff is not of unsound mind. Be that as it may, I am of the view

that the aforementioned facts ought to have been examined by the Courts

below, but the fact of the matter is that the subsequent order dated

16.02.2010 rejecting the plaint was not a correct appreciation of law. There

was no need for the petitioner to move an application under Order 32 Rule

15 CPC, which has been rejected vide order dated 01.02.2010. Resultantly,

the order dated 19.12.2014 passed by this Court remitting the matter to the

trial Court to decide the application moved under Order 32 Rule 15 CPC

afresh, in my view, is an exercise of futility, particularly when the issue had

been framed, therefore, the aforementioned finding of this Court, in my

view, was an error apparent and therefore, the order, under review, is hereby

recalled. The trial Court is directed to decide the the suit in accordance with

the preponderance of the evidence and law.
