                      W.P.(Cr.) No.181 of 2009

                Shivnarayan Prasad......................Petitioner

                      VERSUS

                State of Jharkhand and another.... Respondents

                CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.R.PRASAD

                For the Petitioner : Mr. Indrajit Sinha
                For the State       : Mr. R.K.Singh,G.P.IV

Reserved on 10.8.2009                                        Delivered on 12.8.2009

3.   12.8.09</pre><p id="p_1">.         This application has been filed for quashing the order dated

                17.4.2009 passed by learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ranchi

                under which complaint case lodged by Prem Kumar Khatri,

                respondent no.2 was sent to concerned police station under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_1">section

                156(3)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure for its institution and

                investigation and also for quashing the first information report,

                bearing Chutia P.S. case no.79 of 2009 instituted pursuant to

                aforesaid order passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate.

</p><p id="p_2">                      Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that on

                10.2.2007 one Ravindra Kumar, son of the petitioner had married

                to Payal Khatri (daughter of respondent no.2) who received burn

                injury accidentally on 10.1.2009 and hence, she was admitted to

                T.M.H, Jamshedpur where she remained under treatment for about

                17 days but unfortunately died on 27.1.2009. On the same day,

                respondent no.2 (father of the deceased) gave information before

                the Police Officer of Bistupur Police Station at its police camp at

                T.M.H that her daughter had received burn injury and hence, she

                had been brought to T.M.H for the treatment where she died at

                11.20, upon which U.D case No.1 of 2009 dated 3.2.2009 was

                instituted. While the matter was under investigation, respondent

                no.2 after four months of the occurrence, lodged a complaint case
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            2</span>


bearing no.549 of 2009 on 17.4.2009 putting false allegation that

after the marriage of his daughter, all the accused persons started

subjecting her to torture on account of non-fulfillment of demand

of dowry and ultimately her husband and other accused persons

burnt her to death and thereby they committed offence of dowry

death.     On receiving the said complaint, learned Chief Judicial

Magistrate under order dated 19.2.2009 sent it to concerned police

station under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_2">section 156(3)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure for

its institution. On receiving the said order, the Officer-in-Charge of

Chutia Police Station, vide its letter dated 24.2.2009 informed to

the Chief Judicial Magistrate that one U.D. case, bearing no.1 of

2009 on the basis of statement made by respondent no.2 has

already been instituted on 3.2.2009 which is being investigated

upon but this fact has not been mentioned by the complainant and

as such, there appears to be an ulterior motive on the part of the

complainant.    Subsequently, respondent no.2 filed an application

before the Chief Judicial Magistrate and the learned Chief Judicial

Magistrate then passed an order on 24.4.2009 under which he

again sent the complaint under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_3">section 156(3)</a> of the Code of

Criminal Procedure to the Chutia Police Station for its institution,

upon which case was instituted and as such, the said order as well

as first information report instituted under the aforesaid order have

been sought to be quashed on the ground that the learned

Magistrate failed to appreciate that there had been no need to

resend the complaint petition to the police station as investigation

regarding death of the deceased was going on in connection with

U.D case no.1 of 2009.
</p>
<p id="p_3">         Learned counsel further submits that once the information

regarding death of the deceased has already been given by the

respondent no.2, upon which investigation was going on, any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>


institution of first information report on the subsequent version

would be quite illegal as for the same event two investigations

cannot be carried out and, therefore, institution of the case as

Chutia P.S. case no.79 of 2009 is bad in the law and hence, the

same is fit to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       Learned counsel in support of his submission has referred to

a decision rendered in a case of <a href="/doc/1860600/" id="a_4">Ajay Paswan vs. State of

Jharkhand and others</a> [2009 (2) JLJR 218]                  wherein it has

been held that second first information report for the same and

similar offence is not maintainable as any subsequent statement be

treated as the statement falling under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_5">section 161</a>/<a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_6">162</a> of the Code

of Criminal Procedure.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       Thus, it was submitted that the order under which complaint

case was sent for its institution under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_7">section 156(3)</a> of the Code of

Criminal Procedure and also the first information report are fit to be

set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       There has been no denying of the fact that the scheme<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_8"> of

Code</a> of Criminal Procedure is that an Officer-in-Charge of a Police

Station has to commence investigation as provided in <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_9">section 156</a>

or 157<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_10"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure on the basis of entry of

the first information report, on coming to know of the commission

of a cognizable offence .          On completion of investigation and on

the basis of the evidence collected, he has to form an opinion

under <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_11">section 169</a> or 170<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, as the

case may be, and forward his report to the Magistrate concerned

under <a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_13">section 173(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure. However,

even after filing such report if he comes into possession of further

information or material, he need not register a fresh first

information report as any subsequent statement will be statement

falling under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_14">section 161</a>/<a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_15">162</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 4</span>


      and at the same time he is empowered to make further

      investigation.
</p>
<p id="p_7">             The aforesaid view has been expressed by the Hon'ble

      Supreme Court in a case of <a href="/doc/1974324/" id="a_16">T.T.Antony vs. State of Kerala</a>

      andothers [(2001) 6 SCC 181] . Such view has been expressed

      on the premise that first information report lodged did disclose

      cognizable offence but here, in the instant case, as it appears from

      the statement made by the respondent no.2, as contained in

      Annexure 3 on the basis of which U.D case was lodged that it never

      discloses any commission of cognizable offence, rather simple

      information of deceased receiving burn injury was given whereas

      written complaint upon which first information report was lodged

      does disclose commission of the cognizable offence.

</p><p id="p_8">             In a case of <a href="/doc/1860600/" id="a_17">Ajay Paswan vs. State of Jharkhand and

      others</a> , as referred to above, information regarding commission of

      an offence of kidnapping of the victim was given, upon which U.D

      case was registered but no name of the accused had been given.

      Subsequently, while the matter was under investigation, second

      first information report was lodged wherein allegation was made of

      the commission of the offence under <a href="/doc/122405/" id="a_18">section 306</a> but by the time

      the police in course of investigation of the U.D case did not find

      any hand of the accused and under this situation, it was held by

      this Court that the second first information report for same and

      similar offence is not maintainable but here as I have noticed, the

      fact is quite different and under this situation, I do not find any

      substance in the submission advanced on behalf of the petitioner

      and hence, this application stands dismissed.
