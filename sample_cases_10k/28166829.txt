<p id="p_1">           This is a petition under        <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_1">Section    482</a> of the Code

of Criminal Procedure praying for directions to respondents No.1 to 3

to protect their life and liberty which is alleged to be in danger at the

hands of respondents No. 4 to 6 on account of their having got

married against their parental consent.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           Learned counsel for the petitioners contends that both the

petitioners are major.
</p>
<p id="p_3">           Even though this court is disinclined to entertain and to go

into such allegations, but at the same time it cannot be oblivious to

the fact that because of social friction and sectarian differences such

incidents are not entirely unheard of and prima facie the case also

appears to be covered by the observations of Supreme Court in Fiaz

Ahmed Ahanger &amp; Ors. v. State of J &amp; K 2009(3) R.A.J.692, which
 Crl.Misc.No.M-11411 of 2013 (O&amp;M)               -2-
</p>
<p id="p_4">are as under :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                 "In such cases of intercaste or inter-religion marriage

           the Court has only to be satisfied about two things :

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                  (1) that the girl is above 18 years of age, in which

                  case, the law regards her as a major vide <a href="/doc/153138729/" id="a_2">Section 3</a>

                  of the Indian Majority Act, 1875. A major is

                  deemed by the law to know what is in his or her

                  welfare.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                  (2) The wish of the girl.</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                  In the circumstances, we direct that nobody will

           harass, threaten or commit any acts of violence or other

           unlawful act on the petitioner, Chanchali Devi/Mehvesh

           Anjum and the petitioner's family members and they shall

           not be arrested till further orders in connection with the

           case in question. If they feel insecure, they can apply to

           protection to them."</blockquote><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">           Further, the Delhi High Court in Vivek Kumar @ Sanju

and another v. The State &amp; another, Crl.M.C.No.3073-74/2006

decided on 23.2.2007 observed as under :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                   "There is no law which prohibits a girl under 18

           years from falling in love with someone else. Neither

           falling in love with somebody is an offence under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">IPC</a> or

           any other penal law. Desiring to marry her love is also not

           an offence.   A young girl, who is in love has two courses

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">         available to her - one is that she should marry with the

         consent of her parents after obtaining the consent of her

         parents. If her parents do not agree to persuade them or to

         wait for attaining the age of majority and then exercise her

         right as a major to marry the person of her own choice.

         However, this is possible only when the house of her

         parents where she is living has congenial atmosphere and

         she is allowed to live in peace in that house and wait for

         attaining age of majority. This might have been the reason

         in the mind of petitioner No.2 when she told her father that

         she was in love and wanted to marry Sanju, but the

         response of father when daughter confided in him, created

         the fear in the mind of petitioner No.2. Her father slapped

         her and told that her action would malign the religion and

         bring danger to the religion. He even threatened to kill her

         and marry her off to some rich person. When once a such a

         threat is given to a girl around 17 years of age, who is in

         love, under such circumstances she has a right to protect

         her person and feelings against such onslaught of her

         relatives even if the onslaught is from her own parents.</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">         Right to life and liberty as guaranteed by the Constitution

         is equally available to minors. A father has no right to

         forcibly marry off his daughter, who is below 18 years

         against her wishes. Neither he has right to kill her, because

         she intends to marry out of her religion. If a girl around 17

           herself from the onslaught of her father or relatives and

           joins her lover or runs away with him, it is no offence

           either on the part of the girl or on the part of boy with

           whom she ran away and married."</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">            In view of this, the petition is disposed of with a direction

to respondent No.2 to look into the allegations as contained in the

petition personally and take necessary steps in accordance with law if

the situation so warrants.</blockquote><p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">           This order shall not be construed to be conferring the

legitimacy or authenticity to the factum of marriage having been

performed as well as the age, as the Court is clearly deprived of any

means to determine the aforesaid facts.

to respondent No.2.
