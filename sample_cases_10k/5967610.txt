           duty along with his Manager Mohamood Hassan. DW1 further
           says that at about 7:00-7:15 PM 4-5 persons came to the shop and
           they went to the cash counter and informed that they want to

        carry on some checking of plastic bags. DW1 says that at that
        time beside him and his Manager some staff members were also
        working at the shop and the above said 4-5 persons made the
        checking but they could not find anything there. Then those
        people went to the store room on the back side of the shop and
        they started checking there and from where old stock and plastic
        bags were recovered. There must be 6-7 plastic bags lying there
        and those bags were taken into possession and seized by them.

        is necessary to reproduce relevant extract of above said
        notification which reads as: "1. That the use, sale &amp; storage of all
        kinds of plastic bags shall be forbidden in respect of the following
        places in the National Capital Territory of Delhi, namely, (a). Five
        Star and Four Star hotels, (b). Hospitals with 100 or more beds
        except for the use of plastic bags as prescribed under Bio Medical
        Waste (Management &amp; Handling) Rules, 1998,                (c).   All

        main markets and local shopping centers, (h). All retail and
        wholesale outlets of Branded chain of outlets selling different
        consumer products including fruits and vegetables."          In this
        context it is also necessary to refer to judgment of Hon' able High
        Court of Delhi in "Vinod Kumar Jain Vs. Union of India &amp;
        Othrs." in WP (C) 6456/04 decided on 07.08.08 which is even
        relied upon by counsel for accused. It appears that a writ petition
        was filed in public interest regarding failure of civic agencies
        regarding solid waste management. And directions was sought
        for upgrading the waste management system and effective
        means to curb the tendency to generate needless waste by strict
        legislative measures and also by education people at large about
        hazards to environment arising out of absence of scientific waste
        management program. It was also prayed before Hon'ble High
        Court that directions be given to the state government for
        appropriate amendment in "Delhi Plastic Bags (Manufacture,
        sale and usage) and None-biodegradeable Garbage (Control) Act,
        2000" as well as rules framed there under. So as to ensure that
        provisions can apply not only to prohibition but also to
        manufacture and sale of all plastic bags in Union Territory of
        Delhi.   Hon'ble High Court of Delhi considering the serious
        hazards to the environment because of use of plastic bags in


CC No. 222/09                                   DPCC V/s M/s Bata Shoe Store
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                      8</span>

        Delhi took up the matter and constituted one committee headed
        by former Judge of High Court for giving recommendations
        regarding whether degradeable / biodegradeable bags are an
        alternative or whether bags made of other material can substitute
        plastic bags as well as to give recommendations as to what steps
        can be taken to check health and environment hazards arising
        out of use of plastic bags in Delhi. Hon'ble High Court upon
        considering the report given by the committee accepted most of
        its suggestions and disposed off the writ petition with the
        directions that Govt. of NCT of Delhi will issue proper
        notification for fixing the minimum thickness of the plastic bags
        to 40 microns as well as Govt. of Delhi (DPCC) and other civic
        agencies will take immediate steps for closure of unlicensed
        recycling units operating in non-confirming areas. It was also
        directed that Govt. of NCT of Delhi will issue notification
        forbidding use of plastic bags in main market as well as at local
        shopping centers keeping in view the suggestions given by the
        committee.
</p>

<p id="p_16">      14.   Therefore in this background above mentioned notification
        was     issued   to   minimize     atmospheric     pollution    and
        contamination by the use and unauthorized recycling of plastic
        bags in Delhi. It is violation of prohibition of notification issued
        under <a href="/doc/191236316/" id="a_14">section 5</a> of Act and in compliance of the orders dated
        07.08.08 of Hon'ble High Court attracts penal liability under
        <a href="/doc/24023684/" id="a_15">section 15</a> of Act which reads as "(1)    Whoever fails to comply
        with or contravenes any of the provisions of this Act, or the rules
        made or orders or directions issued there under, shall, in respect
        of each such failure or contravention, be punishable with
        imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years or with
        fine which may extend to one lakh rupees, or with both, and in
        case the failure or contravention continues, with additional fine


CC No. 222/09                                   DPCC V/s M/s Bata Shoe Store
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                      9</span>

        which may extend to five thousand rupees for every day during
        which such failure or contravention continues after the
        conviction for the first such failure or contravention. (2)   If   the
        failure or contravention referred to in sub-section (1) continues
        beyond a period of one year after the date of conviction, the
        offender shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which
        may extend to seven years.
</p>

<p id="p_17">      15.   So it is clear from above discussion that contravention of
        provision of Act or rules made or orders or directions issued
        there under is punishable as provided above. Coming now to the
        facts of the case, in the present case question to be considered is
        whether the notification issued U/s 5 of Act has been violated of
        not, because the notification once issued is a command of law.
        In this regard there is evidence of CW2 to CW4 who have
        consistently stated that SDM, Sadar Bazar along with CW2
        Santosh Kumar and CW3 Vinod Kumar were on general survey
        regarding contravention of notification dated 07.01.09. It is also
        admitted factual position that above said officers visited M/s
        Bata Shoe Store, situated at Kashmere Gate. There is also no
        dispute that they conducted the checking to see if plastic bags are
        being used in the premises of M/s Bata Shoe Store or not and
        CW4 Sh. Pradeep Baijal has specifically stated that they found the
        shoe boxes with shoes and one plastic bag were being stored and
        shoe along with plastic bag in a box were lying in the shop. CW4
        Sh. Pradeep Baijal, SDM recorded the statement of accused
        Mahmood Hassan, which is Ex. CW1/A and also took five plastic
        bags by seizure memo Ex. CW1/B. In complete trail of the matter
        fact that SDM CW4 recorded the statement of accused Ex. CW1/A
        and took into possession plastic bags vide Ex. CW1/B is not
        disputed. It is argued on behalf of the accused that infact there
        were only five plastic bags in the shop at the relevant time,


CC No. 222/09                                    DPCC V/s M/s Bata Shoe Store
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                     10</span>

        because witness CW4 has stated that said five plastic bags were
        taken. I do not agree with the above argument on behalf of the
        accused, because from the post-notice evidence of CW2 to CW4
        it would be evident that witnesses have consistently stated that
        there were plastic bags in the boxes of shoe and five plastic bags
        were taken as sample vide seizure memo Ex. CW1/B.
</p>

<p id="p_18">      16.   It is argued that plastic bags Ex. C1 to C5 were made of virgin
        plastic with thickness of 50 microns and prosecution has failed to
        put on record any evidence that plastic bags seized from the shop
        of the accused were of less thickness and no lab test was
        conducted to prove the same. Again I find that above submission
        is not sustainable in law because if we go through the notification
        Ex. CW2/C what is prohibited is all kinds of plastic bags. There is
        no classification regarding plastic bags that if there are plastic
        bags of virgin plastic or plastic bag of thickness of 50 microns,
        then there is no violation. In fact any kind of plastic bag is
        prohibited to be stored or sold under the notification. It is a
        different aspect that in the judgment of Hon'ble High Court, it
        was observed that the plastic bags must be more then 40
        microns, but law of land is different in the shape of notification
        Ex. CW2/C. Thus there was no requirement on the part of DPCC
        to place on record any lab test.
</p>

<p id="p_19">      17.   It is further argued that notification dated 07.01.09 has not
        been proved to be put to the notice of general public. In this
        regard it is sufficient to observe that notification issued either by
        State Government or by Central Government, court is bound to
        take judicial notice of such gazette notification. Reference in this
        regard can be given of judgment in "State V/s V. Penadeen" AIR
        1971 Ker. 193. In this regard reference can also be given of
        judgment in "State V/s Ram Charan" AIR 1977 MP 68 wherein it


CC No. 222/09                                    DPCC V/s M/s Bata Shoe Store
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                     11</span>

        was held that all statutory orders and notification legislative in
        nature amount to law. Reference can also be given judgment in
        1971 Cr.LJ 406 and 1970 Cr.LJ 1724.          Thus in respect of
        notification, there is no requirement of formal poof in view of the
        provisions of <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_16">Section 57</a> of Indian Evidence Act.
</p>

<p id="p_20">      18.   Matter can be appreciated from another angle, it is to note
        that on behalf of defence also one witness DW1 Raj Kumar was
        examined, who stated that 4/5 persons had come to their shop
        for checking of plastic bags. DW1 was when cross-examined, he
        admitted that plastic bags were being used in the boxes of shoes,
        in which beside shoes one plastic bag was contained. He also
        admits that the said carry bag was of plastic carry bag. Thus even
        in the evidence of DW1, version of DPCC has also been proved.
        Whereas in the cross-examination of CW1 to CW4 nothing
        substantive come to render their testimony to be unreliable.
        Thus, from totality of facts and the evidence on the record, I find
        that DPCC has proved the case against the accused and
        accordingly, I hold the accused guilty for offence U/s 15 of Act.
        Let he be heard on the point of sentence on tomorrow i.e.
        25.02.10.</p><pre id="pre_4">

<p id="p_25">      High level of atmospheric pollution in NCR of Delhi is something

known to all. Atmospheric pollution is because of many factors and

reasons. It is duty of we all to contribute and try to provide for every

citizen a pollution free environment. There are land fill sites packed with

mixture    of   non-biodegradeable    and   toxic   waste   resulting   into

contamination of ground water and even leads to atmospheric pollution.
</p>
<p id="p_26">One of the basic cause for environmental pollution in the NCR of Delhi is

excessive production and consumption of non-biodegradeable material

including plastic bags as well as unauthorized recycling procedure of it

leading to various environmental hazards. It is know to all that plastic

wastes when disposed off still remain in the environment being non-

<p id="p_27">biodegradeable and thus because of it there is a constant threat to

environment as well as health risks to the citizens. Every day we see in

the NCR of Delhi excessive use of plastic bags and plastic waste being

thrown to streams, canals, water bodies or by burning of plastic waste

which cause even more problems to the environment. This is because of

lack of awareness among the citizens regarding environmental hazards

by use of plastic bags. Therefore, it is equal duty of all the citizens that we

should prevent littering of plastic bags packaged beverages, water bottles,

plastic plates so that we can avoid the environmental degradation

because of excessive use of plastic bags. It is to note that when any

plastic burns many deadly chemicals goes to the environment including

dioxin which is main pollutant to cause cancer. Moreover, once there is a

law in the shape of notification dated 07.01.09 vide which there is

prohibition for use, distribution or storage of plastic bags, it is required

that every citizen of NCR of Delhi should understand the adverse effects

because of use of plastic bags to the environment and to the citizens

themselves.
</p>
<p id="p_28">      In view of the fact that the offence is against the environment

therefore, a good example is required to be set, thus keeping in view the
