            CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE G.S.SANDHAWALIA

            Present:           Mr. J.S. Cooner, Advocate,
                               for the petitioners.

<p id="p_1">                               Challenge in the present revision petition is to the order dated

            14.10.2014 (Annexure P-1) passed by the Civil Judge (Jr. Divn.),

            Kurukshetra whereby, the evidence of the petitioners-defendants has been

            ordered to be closed by order on account of the fact that 4 effective

            opportunities including 2 last opportunities had been given to conclude the

            entire evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                               Counsel for the petitioners has submitted that the suit is for

            permanent injunction and only one witness namely Mahinder Singh has to

            be examined and some documents have to be tendered. Kulwant Singh-

            defendant no. 3 has already been examined and the plaintiffs' evidence was

            only closed on 22.03.2014.            It is submitted that the other side can be

            compensated by way of payment of costs and the case is now fixed for

            02.12.2014. It is thus submitted that the trial Court did not impose any costs

            and, therefore, passing of the harsh order of closing the evidence was not

            justified.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                               After hearing counsel for the petitioner, this Court is of the

            opinion that the present petition is liable to be allowed. No notice is being

            issued to the respondents as it will unnecessarily entail unnecessary

            expenses and delay the matter. Even if they put in appearance the result

            would remain the same However, it is open to the respondents to file an

            appropriate application for recalling of the order in case there is any

            concealment of fact.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                               It is settled principle that the rules of procedure are handmaids

            of justice and the case has to be decided on the basis of evidence and the

            parties should be given effective opportunities to adduce their evidence and

            similarly counsel also be given adequate opportunities to cross examine the

            witnesses so that the true picture comes before the Court for just decision of

            the case.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                               Accordingly, keeping in view the above submissions and in

            view of the fact that the petitioners are restricting their claim to examine

            only one Mahinder Singh and tendering documentary evidence, the present

            revision petition is allowed. Order dated 14.10.2014 is set aside and the

            petitioners are allowed to examine Mahinder Singh and tender documents

            so that the trial Court can validly adjudicate upon the merits of the case,

            subject to payment of `3,000/- as costs, to be paid to the opposite side. It is

            made clear that the petitioners shall tender necessary affidavit on

            02.12.2014 date and shall offer him for cross examination at the earliest and

            shall not make any attempt to delay the trial.
