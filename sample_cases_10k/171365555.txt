JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">      1. This is counter claim filed by defendant no. 1 for recovery of Rs. 2,70,000/-.
</p><p id="p_2">            Brief facts of the present case are that initially, the plaintiff, Sh. Ranjeet
            Kumar Madhesia filed a suit against defendants Sh. Ramesh Kumar and
            Naresh Kumar praying for declaration that the agreements dated 04.05.2010
            and 19.05.2010 be declared as null and void, mandatory injunction directing
            the defendants to return the machinery, furniture and other goods to him,
            permanent injunction restraining the defendants from selling or disposing
            off the above said material and award of damages. Thereafter, the
            defendants filed their written statement and defendant no. 1 (hereinafter


Suit No. 356/10                                                 Ramesh Kumar v. Ranjeet Kumar Madhesia                                                        1/8
             referred as 'D-1') filed a counter claim praying for decree of sum of Rs.
            2,70,000/- alongwith interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of
            counter claim till its realization against the non-claimant/plaintiff. But,
            during proceedings of the present suit, the suit filed by plaintiff was
            dismissed in default and for non prosecution on 13.12.2012 and the counter
            claim filed by the D-1 was proceeded further. Hence, this judgment has
            decided the counter claim filed by D-1. For convenience, the parties to the
            suit have been referred as their original position i.e. counter claimant as
            'D-1' and respondent as 'plaintiff'.
</p>

<p id="p_3">      2. In his counter claim, D-1 has stated that he and plaintiff were having
            friendly and cordial relations. In the last week of December 2009, plaintiff
            approached D-1 for financial help of Rs. 5,00,000/-. Considering good
            friendly relationship with the plaintiff, D-1 advanced a sum of Rs.
            5,00,000/- to the plaintiff on 01.01.2010 in cash. The plaintiff assured D-1 to
            repay the said amount within 3-4 months. After passing of 2-3 months, the
            plaintiff did not repay the said amount to D-1 and sought further time from
            him. D-1 acceded to the said request. In April 2010, D-1 came to know from
            the neighbour and business circle of plaintiff that the plaintiff had taken
            financial help from various other persons and he was not able to clear his
            debts. Thereafter, when D-1 contacted the plaintiff, he (plaintiff) offered him
            to purchase the material, machinery, equipments and all other items lying in
            his factory and the amount of Rs. 5,00,000/- should be adjusted towards the
            purchase of the said machinery. D-1 had no option but to accede to the said
            request of plaintiff. Subsequently, the plaintiff executed a mutual agreement
            dated 04.05.2010 in favour of D-1, whereby it was specifically mentioned
            that the said goods would be belonging to D-1 and he would be free to deal
            with the said items in the manner he liked. Further, the plaintiff, in order to


Suit No. 356/10                                                 Ramesh Kumar v. Ranjeet Kumar Madhesia                                                        2/8
             enable D-1 to deal with the said items, executed a special power of attorney
            in his favour on 19.05.2010, whereby he authorized him to sell, mortgage or
            gift the machinery etc. to any person. In order to recover his amount of Rs.
            5,00,000/-, D-1 sold out some machinery/equipments for a sum of Rs.
            2,30,000/-. However, a sum of Rs. 2,70,000/- was still to be recovered from
            the plaintiff. Further, the plaintiff was illegally holding sum of Rs.
            2,70,000/- and failed to clear the said sum to D-1 despite various requests
            made in this regard. Lastly, D-1 had requested the plaintiff in middle of
            August 2010, however, he failed to repay the said amount. Thereafter, the
            plaintiff filed the suit against D-1 only with a view to illegally usurp the said
            amount of D-1. Hence, D-1 has filed the present counter claim.
</p>

<p id="p_4">      3. Vide order dated 28.11.2011 and 16.09.2013, the replication filed by the
            plaintiff in respect of written statement of defendants was considered as
            written statement to the counter claim. In his reply, the plaintiff has stated
            that D-1 is a poor man who had earned his bread by doing work for the
            plaintiff at the space give by him outside his factory. The question of giving
            a loan of Rs. 5,00,000/- could not arise as it was beyond the capacity of D-1.
            D-1 has failed to file any document to show any loan transaction and to
            reflect the source from where he procured and gave alleged loan of Rs.
            5,00,000/- to the plaintiff. Further, both the documents [MOU dated
            04.05.2010 and special power of attorney dated 19.05.2010] were prepared
            and got signed by the plaintiff under undue influence and coercion and
            therefore, both the documents were liable to be declared as null and void.
            The plaintiff has further submitted that he had handed over his machines and
            other items to D-1 in good faith and to save the same from the police
            personnel who were searching for him on a complaint. Further, D-1 should
            be put to strict proof of the sale of some machinery/equipments as claimed.
</p>

<p id="p_5">Suit No. 356/10                                                 Ramesh Kumar v. Ranjeet Kumar Madhesia                                                        3/8
             The plaintiff came to know from his reliable sources that all the machineries
            and items of plaintiff were still lying with the defendants and they had tried
            to mislead the Court by stating about sale of some machinery/equipments.
            He has further denied all other claims/allegations made by D-1 in his
            counter claim.
</p>

<p id="p_6">      4. On the basis of the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed by
            the Court vide order dated 18.11.2013:
</p><p id="p_7">            1.           Whether the counter claimant is entitled to recovery of the sum
                         prayed for? Onus of proof on counter claimant.
</p><p id="p_8">            2.           Relief.
</p>

<p id="p_9">      5. To prove his claim, D-1 examined two witnesses. CCW-1 is D-1/counter
            claimant himself. He submitted almost on the similar lines as stated by him
            in his counter claim. He tendered mutual agreement executed between D-1
            and plaintiff as Ex. CCW-1/1, Special power of attorney executed by
            plaintiff in favour of D-1 as Ex. CCW-1/2, undertaking given by D-1 in
            respect of sale of two machines to one Anwar Khan as Ex. CCW-1/3 and
            agreement of purchase in respect of sale of machine to one Suresh Kumar as
            Ex. CCW-1/4. CCW-2 is Dinesh Kaushik. He stated that he had witnessed
            the execution of mutual agreement Ex. CCW-1/1 and special power of
            attorney Ex. CCW-1/2. Thereafter, D-1/counter claimant closed his
            evidence.
</p>

<p id="p_10">      6. I have heard the arguments from counsel for counter claimant. It is pertinent
            to note that after dismissal of the suit filed by plaintiff, the plaintiff preferred
            not to appear before the Court. Accordingly, the plaintiff did not cross-

<p id="p_11">Suit No. 356/10                                                 Ramesh Kumar v. Ranjeet Kumar Madhesia                                                        4/8
             examine the witnesses tendered by D-1 and advance final arguments. I have
            perused the record.
</p>

<p id="p_12">      7. Issue-wise findings are as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            Issue no. 1
            The counter claimant has submitted that he had advanced loan of Rs.
            5,00,000/- to the plaintiff on 01.01.2010. Although the plaintiff has admitted
            his signatures on mutual agreement Ex. CCW-1/1. Yet, it is pertinent to note
            that plaintiff has alleged that his signatures on the above agreement were
            taken under undue influence and coercion. In the said agreement, it has been
            mentioned that defendant had paid Rs. 5,00,000/- to the plaintiff on
            01.01.2010. The plaintiff neither cross-examined D-1 to impeach his version
            on the aspect of granting of loan nor tendered any evidence to prove that the
            said mutual agreement was signed by him under undue influence and
            coercion. However, it is worth noting that as per D-1, the said amount of Rs.
            5,00,000/- was given by him to the plaintiff in cash. The plaintiff in his
            written statement has raised an objection that D-1 has failed to reflect the
            source from where he procured and gave loan of Rs. 5,00,000/-. In these
            circumstances, D-1 could have produced appropriate evidence on record so
            as to nullify the submission of the plaintiff on this aspect. D-1 has not even
            explained as to from which source and in whose presence, except plaintiff
            and D-1, the said amount of Rs. 5,00,000/- was given to the plaintiff.</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">            Further, it is beyond comprehension that Rs. 5,00,000/- would be given by a
            person in cash and without execution of any document, when the said
            person has reduced into writing all the subsequent dealings with the plaintiff
            and otherwise in the form of Ex. CCW-1/1 to Ex. CCW-1/4. However, the
            Court keeps aside the above said observations in view of the fact that mutual



Suit No. 356/10                                                 Ramesh Kumar v. Ranjeet Kumar Madhesia                                                        5/8
             agreement Ex. CCW-1/1 contains the recital that Rs. 5,00,000/- were given
            by D-1 to the plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_14">      8. The mutual agreement Ex. CCW-1/1 states that 'the first party (D-1) agrees
            to purchase the materials, machinery and all other items and equipments
            from the second party and it has been mutually agreed that the said amount
            shall be adjusted against the sale and purchase of the said items lying in the
            above said factory'. From the above said stipulation, it appears that in
            consideration of repayment of Rs. 5,00,000/- by the plaintiff, D-1 has agreed
            to adjust the said repayment against the material, machinery, all other items
            and equipments lying in the factory of plaintiff. In other words, the articles
            lying at the factory of plaintiff had been considered worth Rs. 5,00,000/-
            and the loan of Rs. 5,00,000/- given by D-1 to plaintiff stood adjusted. From
            the wording of para no. 4 of the counter claim too, similar meaning of the
            said stipulation as mentioned above could be inferred. It has been stated in
            para 4 that in the mutual agreement, it has been mentioned that the said
            goods should belong to D-1. He would be free to deal with items in the
            manner he liked. Above all, in mutual agreement, it has not been reflected in
            any manner that if after sale and purchase of all the materials lying in the
            factory of plaintiff, an amount less than Rs. 5,00,000/- is obtained, then D-1
            will be entitled to get balance amount recovered from the plaintiff. In
            absence of such stipulation too, it shall be considered, by interpreting the
            mutual agreement, that D-1 has purchased all the materials lying in the
            factory of plaintiff against the repayment of Rs. 5,00,000/- taken by plaintiff
            from D-1.
</p>

<p id="p_15">      9. Even otherwise, it is case of D-1 that he could realize only Rs. 2,30,000/-
</p><p id="p_16">            from sale of some machinery/equipments of the plaintiff. It is pertinent to


Suit No. 356/10                                                 Ramesh Kumar v. Ranjeet Kumar Madhesia                                                        6/8
             note that in special power of attorney Ex. CCW-1/2, three items: (a), (b) and
</p><p id="p_17">            (c) had been mentioned. But, D-1 has placed the documents pertaining to
            sale of items mentioned at serial no. (a) and (b) only through documents Ex.
            CCW-1/3 and Ex. CCW-1/4. He has not explained as to what was the sale
            consideration of item mentioned at serial number (c) i.e. 'plastic dana and
            straps total-5300 Kgs'. This shows that the said item is still in the possession
            of D-1. But, D-1 has not valued the said material.
</p>

<p id="p_18">      10.Further, it is not case of D-1 that the items mentioned in special power of
            attorney were the only items lying in the factory of plaintiff. It cannot be
            inferred from the text of special power of attorney Ex. CCW-1/2 that only
            three items mentioned in the said attorney were there in the factory of
            plaintiff. Rather from mutual agreement, it can be inferred that there must be
            other material besides the items mentioned in the special power of attorney
            lying in the factory of plaintiff. D-1 has not explained as to what other
            material beyond the items mentioned in special power of attorney was lying
            in the factory of plaintiff and what amount he had realised after disposing of
            the said material. Above all, it is admitted case of D-1 himself that he had
            sold "some" machinery/equipments of the plaintiff. When D-1 had been
            authorized for sale and purchase of all the items lying in the factory of
            plaintiff, then why after selling some machinery/equipments, D-1 has
            prayed the Court for recovery of balance amount, which is against the terms
            and conditions of mutual agreement Ex. CCW-1/1.

<p id="p_19">      11.Furthermore, D-1 has stated that he sold two machines to one Anwar Khan
            for consideration amount of Rs. 1,40,000/- and a machine to one Suresh
            Kumar for consideration amount of Rs. 90,000/-. But, D-1 did not prefer to
            examine Anwar Khan and Suresh Kumar to substantiate his version that the


Suit No. 356/10                                                 Ramesh Kumar v. Ranjeet Kumar Madhesia                                                        7/8
             said machineries were sold to them or to prove the consideration amount of
            the said sale. It is pertinent to note that the plaintiff had raised suspicion in
            respect of actual sale of some machinery/equipments. A doubt on this aspect
            is raised from submission made by D-1 himself in para no. 9 of his counter
            claim, wherein it has been stated that the non-claimant was illegally holding
            a sum of Rs. 2,70,000/- and failed to clear the said sum to the counter
            claimant despite various requests made in this regard. Lastly, the counter
            claimant had requested the non-claimant in the middle of August 2010.
            However, he failed to repay the said amount and kept on giving false
            promise. It is pertinent to note that as per agreement of purchase Ex.
            CCW-1/4, one machine was purchased by Suresh Kumar on 15.03.2011.
            When D-1 admittedly sold one machine to Suresh Kumar on 15.03.2011,
            then how and and by which calculation, he had requested for repayment of
            Rs. 2,70,000/- to the plaintiff in the middle of August 2010. This raises
            doubt on very basis of the case of D-1. In these circumstances, D-1 has
            failed to prove his entitlement to recover Rs. 2,70,000/- from the plaintiff.
            Issue no. 1 is decided against the counter claimant/D-1.
