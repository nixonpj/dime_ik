    CC No. 429/13                                                                         page no. 2 /14

5                 After that, on 13.01.2014, the accused was examined U/s 313 Cr. PC 
and her statement was duly recorded.  All the incriminating evidence were put to 
the accused, to which the accused denied taking any loan from the complainant. 
She firstly denied her signatures on the promissory note but later on, again said 
that the signatures on the promissory note was her's only but she had not given 
the said promissory note to the complainant. She further submits that she had 
not issued the cheque in question from her side to the complainant. The accused 
also denied receiving any legal notice from the complainant and further denied 
her liability towards the complainant. The accused further stated that she does 
not   even   know   the   complainant.   Infact,   the   complainant   had   financial 
transactions with her father and her father had taken a loan of Rs.50,000/­ @ 
interest of 3% per month from the complainant. Since her father could not pay 
back the loan amount to the complainant within the stipulated period of three 
months, hence, the present case has been filed against her by the complainant. 
She further, claimed that may be her father had given the cheque in question to 
the complainant. It was further submitted by the accused that the complainant 
has also filed another case against her mother. The accused also stated that she 
wanted to lead defence evidence.  


6.                Accused examined herself as DW­1. She stated that she knows the 
complainant as he was on visiting terms with her father and he occasionally used 
to visit her home at Chandan Nagar, however, she had not taken any loan from 
the   complainant.   She   further   stated   that   her   father   had   taken   a   loan   of 
Rs.50,000/­ @ interest of 3% per month from the complainant. At the time of 
taking of loan, her father handedover the cheque in question and one pronote Ex. 
CW1/B and one cheque signed by her mother to the complainant as security. It 


     CC No. 429/13                                                                         page no. 3 /14
 was further submitted by her that since her father could not pay interest for 2­3 
months on the loan, therefore, the complainant has filed the present case and the 
complainant   has  filed   a   number   of   other   cases   against   various   other   persons. 
Thus the complainant is doing the business of money lending. Thereafter DW­1 
was cross examined and discharged.


7.        The   accused   then   examined   her   father   Sh.   R.K.   Nagpal   as   DW­2.   He 
reiterated the averment made by the accused in her examination in chief and the 
same is not being repeated herein for the sake of brevity. Thereafter DW­2 was 
cross   examined   and   discharged.   Defence   evidence   was   closed   and   matter   was 
fixed for final arguments. 


8                 Final   arguments   were   addressed   and   heard   on   behalf   of   both   the 
parties.   Ld. Counsel for the complainant has reiterated the averments made in 
the complaint. He has argued that the accused has failed to disclose any defence. 
Therefore all ingredients of U/s 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_5">NI Act</a> stands fulfilled and the accused is 
liable   to   be   convicted.   Counsel   for   the   complainant   has   also   filed   written 
arguments   on   behalf   of   the   complainant   reiterating   that   all   the   ingredient   for 
offence U/s 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_6">NI Act</a> has been made out against the accused. He has further 
stated   in   his   written   arguments   that   accused   has   not   brought   any   defence 
evidence   to  support   her   claim   that   the   cheque   in   question   has   been   given   as 
security or that she is not liable to pay the cheque amount. Ld. Counsel for the 
complainant has relied upon various case laws, which are as under:

</p>

<p id="p_6">9                 On the other hand, the Counsel for the accused has argued that the 
present   complaint   should   be   dismissed   as   there   is   no   legal   liability   upon   the 
accused to pay the complainant as no loan of Rs.4,50,000/­ was ever taken by 
the accused from the complainant. Infact, the father of the accused handed over 
the cheque in question to the complainant as security. Counsel for the accused 
has   further   stated   that   the   cheque   in   question   has   been   misused   by   the 
complainant.   Counsel   for   the   accused   has   filed   written   arguments   and   has

138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_18">NI Act</a> is committed.
</p>

<p id="p_19">12             In the present case, the accused has stated in the notice framed U/s 
251 Cr. PC that she had signed the cheque in question but had not issued the 
same to the complainant. She stated that she used to keep blank signed cheques 
at her home and that her father might have given the cheque in question to the 
complainant as security. She has reiterated the same in her statement U/s 313 
Cr.   PC   and   also   in   her   examination   in   chief.   She   has   further   stated   that   the 
cheque in question has not been filled by her in notice framed U/s 251 Cr. PC. 
Since the accused has admitted her signatures on the cheque in question and the 
fact that the cheque in question had been given to the complainant, therefore, it 
is  irrelevant  for  offence  U/s 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_19">NI  Act</a>  that  the  cheque  in question  had  been 
given to the complainant by some other person than the accused. It is sufficient 
that the cheque in question has been signed by the accused and that it was given 
to the complainant, to raise the statutory presumption U/s 118 &amp; 139 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_20">NI Act</a> in 
favour of the complainant. Therefore, the particular ingredient for offence U/s 138 
<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_21">NI Act</a>, that whether the cheque in question was issued or not to the complainant 
is clearly in favour of the complainant and against the accused.

 13             The   accused   has   further   denied   receiving   legal   notice   from   the 
</pre><p id="p_20">complainant in her  notice U/s 251 Cr. PC, statement U/s 313 Cr. PC and her 
cross examination. However, the statutory presumption of delivery of notice is in 
favour of the complainant. Further, the legal notice has been sent at the same 
address as the summons from the court which has been duly received by the 
accused. The accused has also admitted in her cross examination that she has 
been residing at the same address on which the legal notice has been sent since 
her  birth till 04.02.2014 and the legal notice has been sent on 23.04.2013, at 
which time the accused was still residing at that address. Further, she has also 
admitted   her   signatures   in   her   cross   examination   on   Ex.   CW1/I   which   is   the 
registered AD card for the legal notice sent by registered post. In light of all this, it 
can safely be concluded that the legal notice was also received by the accused. 
Hence, the disputed question to be decided is whether the cheque in question was 
issued in discharge of legal liability / debt to the complainant.  
</p>

<p id="p_21">14             Now, the question of liability of the accused to pay the complainant 
shall  be  dealt   with.  In the  present  case  the  complainant   has  averred  that   the 
cheque in question was issued against discharge of liability arising out of loan 
transaction   between   the   parties.   Since   the   cheque   in   question   is   bearing   the 
name   of   complainant   and   the   present   complaint   has   been   filed   by   the 
complainant in his own name therefore, presumption arises U/s 118­A &amp; 139 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_22">NI 
Act</a> in favour of the complainant that the cheque was issued in discharge of a 
legal liability. Thus, the onus to rebut this presumption is on the accused. The 
accused   has   disputed   her   legal   liability   to   make   payment   on   the   ground   that 
there was no loan transaction between the parties and that the same has been 
misused by the complainant. 
</p>

<p id="p_22">15             The   accused   has   taken   the   defence   that   the   cheque   had   been 
handedover to the complainant in blank signed condition. The accused has relied 
upon <a href="/doc/4554/" id="a_23">Avon Organics Ltd v. Pioneer Products Ltd and Ors</a> in criminal Appeal  

  CC No. 429/13                                                                         page no. 7 /14
 no.   181/1999  decided   by  Hon'ble  Andhra   Pradesh   High  Court   on   04.07.2003, 
wherein it was held that if a blank cheque has been issued by the accused no 
evidence exist to show that the accused had consented to the payee filling up the 
amount   in   the   cheque,   then   the   accused   is   not   liable   U/s   138   <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_24">NI   Act</a>.   The 
complainant, on the other hand, has denied in his cross examination that the 
cheque in question was a blank signed cheque and rather stated that the accused 
has given the cheque in question in filled up condition. The law does not require 
that for offence u/s 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_25">NI Act</a>, the entire cheque has to be in handwriting of the 
accused.   Admission   of   signatures   is   sufficient   to   prove   that   the   cheque   in 
question  must   have  been  issued  in  discharge of  some  legal liability   / debt.  <a href="/doc/324041/" id="a_26">In 
Jaipal Singh Rana v. Swaraj Pal</a> 149 (2008) DLT 682, the Hon'ble Delhi High 
Court has held that there is no alteration in a cheque if the amount and the date 
are filled by somebody else apart from the signatory of the cheque. It was further  
held that there is no law that requires the filling up of entire cheque by drawer 
himself. Further, in <a href="/doc/692276/" id="a_27">Ravi Chopra v. State &amp; Anr</a> 2008 (2) LRC 118 (Del), it has 
been   held   that   if   a   blank   signed   cheque   is   given   then   it   is   possible   that   the 
drawer has consented impliedly or expressly to filling up of the cheque by the 
payee on a later date. Further in  <a href="/doc/143232225/" id="a_28">Vijender Singh v. Eicher Motors Ltd &amp; Anr</a> 
decided by Hon'ble Delhi High Court on 05.05.2011, it was laid down that any 
person who issues blank signed cheque should understand the consequences of 
doing so. Therefore, in view of the above case laws, it is no defence to offence U/s 
138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_29">NI Act</a> that the cheque in question was issued in blank signed condition. 
</p>

<p id="p_23">16             It is the case of the complainant that the complainant gave a loan of 
Rs.4,50,000/­   to   the   accused   and   also   got   Ex.   CW1/B   on   the   day   of   loan 
transaction.       It   is   true   that   for   offence   U/s   138   <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_30">NI   Act</a>,   the   accused   is   not  
expected   to   prove   his   defense   beyond   reasonable   doubt   in   order   to   rebut   the 
statutory presumption. Same has been held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/363129/" id="a_31">Kumar 
Exports v. Sharma Carpets</a> (2009) 2 SCC 513. Now it will have to be examined 
whether the accused has been able to rebut the statutory presumption U/s 118 &amp;

<p id="p_24">17             The Hon'ble High Court of Delhi has held in  <a href="/doc/8322296/" id="a_33">V.S. Yadav v. Reena</a>  
172 (2010) DLT 561  that the offence U/s 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_34">NI Act</a> is a technical offence and 
the complainant is required only to prove that the cheque issued by the accused 
was dishonored, that the cheque was issued in discharge of legal liability / debt, 
that legal notice was sent by the complainant within 30 days of dishonor and that 
accused failed to pay the cheque amount within 15 days of receipt of legal notice.
</p>

<p id="p_25">18             It is the duty of the Court to balance the statutory presumption in 
favour of the complainant and the defence disclosed / material produced by the 
accused in order to rebut the statutory presumption and then come to a view 
regarding the ascertainment of the truth. The same has been held by the Apex 
Court in <a href="/doc/673245/" id="a_35">Krishana Janardhan Bhat v. Dattatraya G. Hegde Criminal Appeal  
No</a>. 518 of 2006. 
</p>

<p id="p_26">19             In the instant  case the accused has no where stated either  in her 
notice U/s 251 Cr. PC, statement U/s 313 Cr. PC or in her evidence that she had 
demanded return of the cheque in question from the complainant or she had sent 
any legal notice to the complainant to return the cheque in question along with 
the blank signed paper given to the complainant. Hence, the accused has failed to 
prove that she act like a prudent, reasonable person and in absence of the same, 
her defence that she had not taken the loan amount from the complainant can 
not taken to be proved. It is not even the case of the accused that the father of 
the accused ever demanded the return of the cheque in question along with the 
blank signed paper orally or in writing from the complainant. 
</p>

<p id="p_27">20             Ex.   CW1/B   fortifies   the   statutory   presumption   in   favour   of   the 
complainant as the said document is a promissory note / receipt executed by the 
accused   in   favour   of   the   complainant   acknowledging   the   loan   amount   of 



  CC No. 429/13                                                                         page no. 9 /14
 Rs.4,50,000/­ between the parties. Ex. CW1/B  clearly states that the accused 
has taken a loan of Rs.4,50,000/­ in cash without   any   interest   and   the   same 
shall be returned on demand or order to the complainant within one and half 
years.   The   accused   has   admitted   her   signature   on   Ex.   CW1/B,   however,   the 
accused has stated that she had not given this receipt to the complainant and 
that her father may have handedover the same to the complainant. The father of 
the   accused   has   stated   in   his   evidence   that   he   had   handedover   blank   signed 
pronote to the complainant. It is a basic principle of the law of evidence that a 
fact is said to be proved when its existence is so probable that a reasonable man 
would believe it to be true. In the instant case, the father of the accused has used 
the word 'blank signed pronote' in his examination in chief, and not 'blank signed 
paper'.   Therefore,   it   is   hard   to   believe   that   a   pronote   which   was   supposedly 
created after obtaining the signatures, would be in the knowledge of the father of 
the   accused   at   the   time   of   handingover   the   blank   signed   paper   to   the 
complainant.   Further,   the   signature   of   the   accused   on   Ex.   CW1/B   is   across 
revenue   stamp   and   no   normal   prudent   reasonable   person   would   give   a   blank 
signed stamped paper to any person. Further, Ex. CW1/B is printed in such a 
manner that there is optimum gap between the printed portion and the pasted 
stamp bearing signatures of the accused across it. This fact makes it improbable 
that the typed portion of Ex. CW1/B was typed after obtaining the signature of 
the   accused.   Further,   the   accused   herself   has   admitted   that   the   address 
mentioned   on   Ex.   CW1/B   below   her   signatures   is   in   her   handwriting,   which 
further fortifies the case of the complainant that the said document was already 
typed when it was duly signed by the accused. Thus it is proved that the accused 
signed Ex. CW1/B  after it was typed and since the accused has admitted her 
signature   on   Ex.   CW1/B,   therefore,   the   execution   of   this   receipt   is   also   not 
disputed. Hence, Ex. CW1/B appears to be a genuine document and this court 
deems it fit to rely upon the same.

<p id="p_28">21            The defence raised by the accused that there was no loan transaction 
between the parties, rather there was a loan transaction between the complainant 


  CC No. 429/13                                                                         page no. 10 /14
 and father of the accused appears to be a clever after thought concocted by the 
accused   to   sleep   away   from   the   hands   of   law.   It   does   not   appear   to   be   the 
behavior of a reasonable prudent person to take loan and then issue blank signed 
cheques and blank signed paper in the name of his wife and daughter. There, is 
no   explanation   put   forward   by   the   accused   as   to   why   she   kept   blank   signed 
cheques   at   her   home   when   she   was   not   earning   and   was   only   maintaining 
balance of Rs.20,000/­ to Rs.30,000/­ in her account. There is no explanation as 
to why the father of the accused would give a blank signed cheque signed by his  
daughter   after   taking   a   loan   of   Rs.50,000/­   no   knowing   fully   well   that   his 
daughter   is   only   maintaining   a   balance   of   Rs.20,000/­   to   Rs.30,000/­   in   her 
account. It is also unbelievable that the father of the accused would give blank 
signed   cheque   and   blank   signed   paper   in   the   name   of   his   daughter   without 
informing his daughter as claimed by the accused consistently that the cheque in 
question and Ex. CW1/B may have been given by her father to the complainant. 
Further, the accused in her  evidence has been unable to explain the purpose of 
keeping   blank   signed   cheques   at   her   house   when   she   has   stated   in   her 
examination in chief that she is a student and is not earning any money. It is also 
unbelievable that her father would issue her cheque for security purposes, if the 
accused was not earning any money and did not have sufficient balance in her 
account as stated in her cross examination. She has stated she used to keep only 
Rs.20,000/­ to Rs.30,000/­ in her account. The accused has also contradicted 
herself in her cross examination wherein she has stated in one point that she 
used to keep entire cheque book in blank signed condition, but later on she has 
stated that she used to keep one or two blank signed cheques only. All of the 
above, cumulatively, do not inspire confidence and the accused is not considered 
to be a reliable witness. Furthermore, the actions of her father do not seem to be 
the actions of a reasonable prudent person and hence, he also is a unreliable 
witness. 
</p>

<p id="p_29">22             Counsel for the accused has stated in his written arguments that the 
complainant has deposed that he will show the loan amount in his ITR whenever 


  CC No. 429/13                                                                         page no. 11 /14
 he   file   the   same.   However,   as   the   complainant   has   not   filed   his   ITR   till   date 
therefore, the transaction in question has not been proved by the complainant. It 
is the law of evidence that a document which supports the case of a party, the 
onus is upon that party to either bring or summon the document in evidence to 
prove its case. In the instant case, if the ITR of the complainant for the relevant 
period was crucial to the accused for his case, the onus was upon the accused to 
summon the said document from the complainant, however, the record of entire 
cross examination of the complainant shows that only question was put to the 
complainant about reflecting the loan amount in his ITR, and no where has the 
accused called upon the complainant to produce his ITR for the relevant period 
as and when is the same filed by him. Therefore, the said arguments does not 
deserves any consideration. 
</p>

<p id="p_30">23             Counsel for the accused has further argued in his written arguments 
that   the   loan   in   question   is   doubtful   as   the   complainant   has   admitted   in   his 
cross examination that the father of the accused approached him for loan but he 
had refused him on the ground that the father of the accused was already under 
liability   and   therefore,   it   is   unbelievable   that   the   complainant   would   advance 
such a huge amount of loan to the daughter of the same person. As discussed 
above, the accused is require to prove her defence on the basis of preponderance 
of   probability.   The   arguments   advanced   by   the   counsel   for   the  complainant   is 
merely a conjecture that the complainant could not have advance such a heavy 
loan amount to the daughter of the same person to whom he had refused to give 
loan.   No   documentary   evidence   has   been   brought   forward   by   the   accused   to 
dispute   the   factum   of   loan   transaction,   while   the   complainant   has   placed   on 
record the receipt of withdrawal of Rs.4,00,000/­ from his bank account and the 
promissory note admittedly signed by the accused. Therefore, this defence on the 
basis of mere conjecture can not be accepted. 
</p>

<p id="p_31">24             Counsel for the accused further stated in his written arguments that 
the complaint has been filed with malafidely intention as the complainant has

other complaint cases U/s 138 <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_36">NI Act</a> against the mother of the accused which is 
pending before another court. Firstly, the accused has not brought any evidence 
to   show   that   the   complainant   is   a   money   lender   and   secondly,   even   if   it   is 
assumed to be true that the complainant is a money lender than also this is no 
defence as <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_37">Section 138</a> NI Act is a remedy enforcible before criminal court and no

Criminal Appeal no. 870/2013 decided on 27.03.2014. further, the fact that 
the complainant may have filed other complaints against family members of the 
accused is no defence for the accused in the present case. 
</p>

<p id="p_32">25             Counsel for the accused has relied on several case laws in support of 
his contentions, however, the said case laws are distinguishable from the present 
complaint on the facts of the case and therefore, are inapplicable.

by the accused that the explanations given is not only reasonable, but also a true 
one. In order to do so, the accused is required to produce such cogent evidence
