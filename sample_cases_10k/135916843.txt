JUDGMENT:
</pre>
<p id="p_1">             The present complaint has been filed by the complainant against the
accused under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_2">section 138</a> Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.
</p>

<p id="p_2">Version of the complainant:
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.           The complainant has stated in his complaint that he and the accused
had friendly relations. In April 2013, the accused approached the complainant and


C.C. No. 1828/16                Dated 28.08.2018                        Page 1/13
 induced him to advance loan of Rs. 4,50,000/- to him. At that time, the accused
stated to the complainant that the amount is urgently required in cash. Thus, the
complainant advanced a friendly loan of Rs. 4,50,000/- in cash to the accused. A
promissory note was executed that the accused will pay Rs. 3,50,000/- back to the
complainant in the month of July 2013 and the balance amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- in
the month of August 2013. In discharge of his part liability, the accused issued a
cheque bearing no. 047480 dated 22.07.2013 for Rs.3,50,000/-. On presentation, the
said cheque was returned dishonoured vide return memo dated 23.07.2013.
Thereafter, the complainant requested the accused to make the entire payment.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3.            On 10.08.2013, the accused issued a cheque bearing no. 047481
dated 10.08.2013 in favour of the complainant towards discharge of complete
liability. However, on presentation of the said cheque, the same was returned
dishonoured for the reasons "Funds Insufficient" vide cheque return memo dated
13.08.2013.
</p>

<p id="p_5">4.            The complainant then issued a legal notice dated 19.08.2013 vide
Registered post as well as AD. However, despite due service, the accused did not
make the payment within the stipulated period. Hence the accused has committed
an offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_3">section 138</a> Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and he is liable to be
prosecuted in accordance with law.
</p>

<p id="p_6">5.            Summons were issued upon the accused vide order dated 24.09.2013.
The accused entered his appearance on 21.06.2014. He was granted bail on the
same day.
</p>

<p id="p_7">Notice against the accused:
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.            Following notice was framed against the accused on 19.11.2014:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                      I, Preeti Agarwala, MM-01 (West) Delhi do hereby serve

<p id="p_9">            It is the allegation against you that you had issued a cheque

            The Nainital Bank Limited, Guru Harikrishan Nagar, Rohtak Road,


C.C. No. 1828/16                   Dated 28.08.2018                            Page 2/13
              Pashchim Vihar, New Delhi in favour of complainant in discharge
             of its legal liability towards the complainant. On presentation by
             the complainant with its banker same got dishonoured with

            signatures n plain documents and also taken the cheque in
            question as security cheque for the pre requisite condition of
            getting the bank loan but later on complainant misused my
            documents and cheque in question with ulterior motive. I have
            no legal enforceable liability towards the complainant.
            Q. Whether the cheque in question bears your signatures?
            A. Yes. Particulars were not filled by me.

</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">Evidence:
</p>

<p id="p_12">7.             The complainant examined himself as CW-1 who was cross examined
by Ld. Counsel for the accused. CE was closed vide order dated 18.12.2017.
Statement of the accused was recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_7">section 313</a> Cr.P.C on 16.05.2018.
The accused did not lead DE and DE was closed vide order dated 16.08.2018. Final
arguments were heard on behalf of both the parties and my findings are as under:-
</p>



<pre id="pre_2">C.C. No. 1828/16                      Dated 28.08.2018                               Page 3/13
 The Law:

</pre><p id="p_13">8.              Before proceeding to the merits of the case, it is considered important
to lay down the basic provisions of law with respect to <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_8">section 138</a> of the Act which
are as follows:
</p>

<p id="p_14">9.              <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_9">Section 138</a> of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 makes dishonour
of cheques an offence. It provides that "where any cheque drawn by a person on an
account maintained by him with a banker for payment of any amount of money to
another person from out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any
debt or other liability, is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount
of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque or
that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement
made with that bank, such person shall be deemed to have committed an offence
and shall, without prejudice to any other provisions of this Act, be punished with
imprisonment for a term which may be extended to two years, or with fine which may
extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both".
</p>

<p id="p_15">10.             Careful reading of <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_10">section 138</a> of the Act reflects that there are three
key ingredients which need to exist for there to be an offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_11">section 138</a>
Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The three ingredients were laid down in the case
of <a href="/doc/673245/" id="a_12">Krishna Janardhan Bhat v. Dattatraya G. Hegde</a> AIR 2008 SC 1325 wherein
the Supreme Court held that the procedural requirements of <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_13">section 138</a> are:
</p>
<pre id="pre_3">(i)     There is a legally enforceable debt.
(ii)    The drawer of the cheque issued the cheque to satisfy part or whole of the
        debt.
</pre><p id="p_16">(iii)   The cheque so issued has been returned due to insufficiency of funds.
</p>

<p id="p_17">11.             It is a well settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that a criminal trial
proceeds on the presumption of innocence of the accused i.e. an accused is
presumed to be innocent unless proved guilty. Thus, normally the initial burden to
prove is on the complainant/ prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused. Also, the
standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt. However, in offences under section

C.C. No. 1828/16                      Dated 28.08.2018                             Page 4/13
 138 of the Act, there is a reverse onus clause contained in <a href="/doc/517539/" id="a_14">sections 118</a> and <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_15">139</a> of
the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_18">12.             <a href="/doc/1177058/" id="a_16">Section 118(a)</a> of the Act provides that until the contrary is proved, it
shall be presumed that "that every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for
consideration, and that every such instrument, when it has been accepted, indorsed,
negotiated or transferred, was accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred for
consideration."
</p>

<p id="p_19">13.             Further, <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_17">Section 139</a> of the Act lays down that "it shall be presumed,
unless the contrary is proved, that the holder of a cheque received the cheque of the
nature referred to in <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_18">section 138</a> for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or
other liability."
</p>

<p id="p_20">14.             Thus, <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_19">section 139</a> of the Act puts the burden on the accused to prove
his defence. However, the accused has to prove his defence on the balance of
probabilities and not beyond reasonable doubt. Once the presumption is displaced,
the accused is liable to be acquitted.
</p>

<p id="p_21">Findings:
</p>
<p id="p_22">15.             The accused stated in his statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_20">Section 313</a> Cr.PC that "I
had given a blank signed cheque to the complainant to arrange the bank loan but
the same has been misused by the complainant. He never arranged for any bank
loan for me. I had also not taken any loan from the complainant as alleged in the
present complaint. I have not issued the cheque in question for any legal liability."
From this statement, it is clear that the accused has admitted that he had given the
impugned cheque to the complainant although it is his contention that he had given
the same to arrange for a bank loan which he never did.
</p>

<p id="p_23">Financial Capacity:-
</p>
<p id="p_24">16.             To prove that the accused had not taken any loan from the
complainant, Ld. Counsel for the accused submitted that the complainant did not

C.C. No. 1828/16                    Dated 28.08.2018                          Page 5/13
 have the financial capacity to advance loan of Rs. 4,50,000/- to the accused. He
submitted that there is a grave doubt on the source of funds as when the
complainant was asked about it in his cross examination, he deposed that "I did not
maintain any accounts and records because there is no such big business." Ld.
Counsel for the accused submitted that from the above statement of the complainant
it is clear that the complainant did not have a big business and thus, his financial
capacity to advance such a huge amount of money is dubious.
</p>
<p id="p_25">17.          At this stage, it is imperative to point out that Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of <a href="/doc/1791370/" id="a_21">K. Prakashan v. P.K. Surenderan</a> case held that if a huge amount of
money is advanced as a loan then the person who has purportedly advanced the
loan must also show the solvency to the extent of the loan either through the bank
account or through other means. By saying and admitting that he does not have a
big business, a grave doubt is raised on his financial capacity to advance a huge
loan amount of Rs. 4,50,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_26">Execution of documents:-
</p>
<p id="p_27">18.          To further prove that the accused had not taken any loan from the
complainant, Ld. Counsel for the accused asked the complainant in his cross-
examination if any loan document was executed at the time of advancement of loan
to which the complainant as CW-1 deposed that "There was no written agreement
was executed between me and the accused but promissory note was executed
between us." Ld. Counsel for the accused submitted that the complainant has
admitted that there was no written agreement. He further submitted that though the
complainant is relying upon a promissory note but the same is a photocopy. He
pointed out that the complainant has admitted that "It is correct that Ex. CW-1/A
dated 24.09.2013, the promissory note is the photocopy." He argued that since the
promissory note is a photocopy, the same cannot be relied upon. However, careful
reading of the cross examination shows that the complainant stated that the original
promissory note is with his counsel though the same was never produced by him.
The promissory note was an essential document for the decision of the present case
yet the complainant chose not to produce the original promissory note before the
court. Though the photocopy of the promissory note has been exhibited by the Ld.
</p>
<p id="p_28">C.C. No. 1828/16                  Dated 28.08.2018                           Page 6/13
 Predecessor of this court, however, the exhibit does not mention that original
promissory note has been seen and returned (OSR). Even on the pre-summoning
evidence, it has not been mentioned that the original promissory note has been seen
and returned. Since, 'OSR' has not been mentioned on the document and the
original promissory note has not been produced during the course of proceedings
and further, it is also settled law that mere exhibition of document does not mean
that it stands proved, thus, this court is not inclined to rely upon the said promissory
note. Even otherwise, Ld. Counsel for the accused submitted that the accused never
signed any promissory note and further that the same in undated. Careful and
minute perusal of the promissory note shows that the alleged signatures of the
accused on the same do not match the admitted signatures of the accused on the
bail bonds and notice under <a href="/doc/429078/" id="a_22">section 251</a> Cr.P.C. Thus, the execution of the
promissory note is full of suspicion making it unreliable.
</p>

<p id="p_29">Income Tax Return:-
</p>
<p id="p_30">19.           The complainant was also asked in his cross examination if he had
shown the loan transaction in his income tax returns to which the complainant
deposed "It is correct that I have not disclosed in my income tax return of 2013-14
about giving loan to the accused."
</p>

<p id="p_31">20.           Ld. Counsel for the complainant submitted that whether the
complainant shows the loan transaction in his income tax returns or not is immaterial
for determining whether the offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_23">section 138</a> of the Act is made out or not.
He submitted that the matter is between the complainant and the income tax
department and this court is not concerned with the same for the purposes of
deciding the present matter. It is pertinent to note that in the case of Krishna
Janardhan (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that "The courts below failed to
notice that ordinarily in terms of <a href="/doc/1821008/" id="a_24">Section 269SS</a> of the Income Tax Act, any advance
taken by way of any loan of more than Rs. 20,000/- was to be made by way of an
account payee cheque only." However, Ld. Counsel for the complainant placed
heavy reliance on the judgment of <a href="/doc/708610/" id="a_25">Krishna P.Moajkar v. Joe Ferrato</a> 2013 SCC
online Bom 862 where Bombay High Court held as follows:

                  "The learned Counsel for the respondent submitted that the observations
        of the Supreme Court in para 14 of the judgment in Rangappa (supra) show that
        the Supreme Court had not in any way cast any doubt on the correctness of the
        decision in Krishna Janardhan Bhat (supra), as it was based on specific facts and
        circumstances therein. Therefore, he submitted that observations in Krishna
        Janardhan Bhat (supra) about noncompliance of provisions of <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_26">Section
        269SS</a> and the implications of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_27">Section 271D</a> of the Income Tax Act would still
        stand as good law. The learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that even
        these observations would stand impliedly overruled. He pointed out that what was
        held in Krishna Janardhan Bhat (supra) was that advance taken by way of loan of
        more than Rs. 20,000/- was only to be made by way of an account payee cheque.
        He submitted that in Rangappa (supra) the Supreme Court was specifically
        considering the case of an advance of Rs. 45,000/- made in cash and yet the
        Supreme Court had upheld the conviction recorded. Thus even those observations
        based on the provisions of <a href="/doc/1821008/" id="a_28">Section 269SS</a> and <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_29">271D</a> of the Income Tax Act
        made in Krishna Janardhan Bhat (supra) would stand impliedly overruled. I am
        entirely in agreement with the learned Counsel for the appellant because the
        Supreme Court in Rangappa (supra) had specifically noted the judgment
        in Krishna Janardhan Bhat (supra). The Supreme Court had obviously noted the
        observations in para 26 in Krishna Janardhan Bhat (supra) that advance of more
        than Rs. 20,000/- was to be made only by way of an account payee cheque, and
        yet the Supreme Court accepted case of a complainant who claimed to have
        made an advance of Rs. 45,000/- in cash and proceeded to uphold the conviction,
        even though the case rested on the fact that cash advance of a sum more than
        Rs. 20,000/- was made. Thus, on this aspect also Krishna Janardhan Bhat (supra)
        stood impliedly overruled by Rangappa (supra), and the judgment is to be held
        rendered on the facts of that case, not laying down any law. Therefore, judgments
        which follow Krishna Janardhan Bhat (supra) can be safely ignored."

<p id="p_33">21.           While relying on <a href="/doc/150051/" id="a_30">Rangappa v. Sri Mohan</a> case, the Bombay High
Court held that <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_31">section 138</a> of the Act is attracted even if the loan transaction is in
cash and is not shown in the income tax returns. The Bombay High Court also held
that Rangappa case (supra) has impliedly overruled the Krishna Janardhan case
(supra) and therefore, the cases that rely upon Krishna Janardhan case (supra)
can safely be ignored. However, it is imperative to point out that Rangappa case
(supra) has not overruled the Krishna Janardhan case (supra) as the Supreme
Court had itself held in Rangappa case that :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                 "In light of these extracts, we are in agreement with the respondent-
        claimant that the presumption mandated by <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_32">Section 139</a> of the Act does indeed
        include the existence of a legally enforceable debt or liability. To that extent, the
        impugned observations in Krishna Janardhan Bhat (supra) may not be correct.
        However, this does not in any way cast doubt on the correctness of the decision in
        that case since it was based on the specific facts and circumstances therein. As
        noted in the citations, this is of course in the nature of a rebuttable presumption
        and it is open to the accused to raise a defence wherein the existence of a legally
        enforceable debt or liability can be contested. However, there can be no doubt that
        there is an initial presumption which favours the complainant."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11"> 22.            The Supreme Court in Rangappa case (supra) only overruled that part
of Krishna Janardhan case which dealt with the presumption under <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_33">section 139</a> of
the Act and did not hold that an offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_34">section 138</a> of the Act is made out
even if the loan transaction exceeding Rs. 20,000/- is in cash and is not shown in the
income tax returns. The judgment in Rangappa case is absolutely silent on this
point. Krishna Janardhan case had specifically stated that any cash transaction of
more than Rs. 20,000/- cannot be given effect to. In Rangappa case this, matter was
not in issue and thus, it cannot be presumed that merely because the court upheld
the conviction with respect to a cash transaction for Rs. 45,000/-, it stated/ meant/
implied that even if the cash loan transaction is of Rs. 20,000/- and above and is not
shown in the income tax returns, the offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_35">section 138</a> of the Act can be
made out. On the contrary, the Supreme Court has categorically held in Krishna
Janardhan case (supra) that such a transaction cannot be given any effect and the
case under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_36">section 138</a> of the Act loses ground and cannot be held to be made out.
</blockquote><p id="p_34">It is settled principle of law that even obiter dicta is not binding though that is a
finding of the court, here the court in Rangappa case (supra) has not delved into the
issue of cash transaction being shown or not shown in income tax returns at all.
Thus, this court is still bound by the law laid down in Krishna Janardhan case as it
still holds good law. This court is clearly not bound by the judgment of Bombay High
Court and thus, holds that a cash loan transaction exceeding Rs. 20,000/- which is
not shown in the income tax returns cannot be the basis of an offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_37">section
138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Such transactions are unaccounted
transactions. Either the transaction should be way of account payee cheque or if it is
in cash, it should be adequately shown in the income tax returns so that it is an
accounted transaction.
</p>
<p id="p_35">23.            Since the year 2004, the Supreme Court has held that unaccounted
transactions are illegal transactions. In the case of G. Pankajakshi Amma and
Others v. Mathai Mathew (Dead) Through Lrs. and Another (2004) 12 SCC 83
which dealt with a suit for recovery of money, it was held that :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">                 "10. ...According to the 1st respondent these transactions were to be
        unaccounted transactions. According to the 1 st respondent, all these amounts are
        paid in cash. If these are unaccounted transactions then they are illegal
        transactions. No court can come to the aid of the party in an illegal transaction. It is
        settled law that in such cases the loss must be allowed to lie where it falls. In this

         case as these are unaccounted transactions, the court could not have lent its
        hands and passed a decree..."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_36">24.           Further, in the case of <a href="/doc/145910605/" id="a_38">Devender Kumar v. Khem Chand</a> 2015 (223) DLT
419 it was held as follows:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">                 "22. Keeping the above proposition of law in mind, on an analysis of fact,
        the scale of balance tilts in favour of the respondent. The respondent appears to
        have rebutted the presumption under <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_39">section 139</a> of the NI Act, namely, the
        existence of a legally enforceable debt by establishing that no loan was advanced
        to him even though there was an agreement and a corresponding promissory note
        and an affidavit. The aforesaid loan was not shown in the ITR return of the
        petitioner. An adverse inference could be drawn against the petitioner on that
        account. The loan amount also appears to be doubtful."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_37">25.           Delhi High Court had affirmed its stand on unaccounted transactions
even in the case of Kulvinder Singh v. Kafeel Ahmed 2013(2) AD (Delhi) 81
where it was held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">                  "He has not reflected the loan advanced to the respondent in his income-
        tax return nor is he able to tell to the court the Ward in which the income-tax return
        is filed. The learned Magistrate has rightly placed reliance on the provisions of
        Section 269 SS of the Income-Tax Act wherein it is specifically laid down that if a
        loan is advanced which is more than `20,000/-, it has to be by way of writing
        reflected in the books of account but nothing of that sort has been done in the
        instant case. Obviously, this clearly creates a doubt regarding the truthfulness of
        the stand taken by the petitioner that he had advanced a loan of `9,30,000/- to the
        respondent."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_38">26.           From the above decisions, it is clear that the courts above have not
supported the complainants who have lent an amount more than Rs.20,000/- in cash
and have not reflected the said amount in their income tax returns. This is so even if
there are supportive documents to show that the loan was advanced while in the
present case, there are no supportive documents (as admitted by the complainant
himself). As per Section 269 SS of the Income Tax Act, it is illegal to advance loan
more than an amount of Rs. 20,000/- in cash. This court is of the opinion that
advancing loan of Rs. 4,50,000/- in cash and not showing the said transaction in the
income tax returns has ulterior hidden motives which are against the law of the land.
Allowing the case of the complainant in the present circumstances would mean the
court of justice accepting and supporting the illegal act of the complainant. Allowing
an illegal transaction to hold good would tantamount to an illegality being committed
by this court which in no situation, can be permitted.

</p><p id="p_40"> 27.           Also, existence of legal debt or liability is an important ingredient to be
proved for an offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_40">section 138</a> NI Act to be made out. Emphasis should be
laid on the fact that the debt or liability should be legal. Legal means lawful by all
means as per the law existing in the country and thus, the transaction by which debt
or liability arises should also be legal as per the provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_41">Income Tax Act</a>. In the
present case, the transaction of advancing loan, if at all, was illegal and thus, cannot
be considered to be a legal debt or liability.
</p>

<p id="p_41">Requirement of Loan:
</p>
<p id="p_42">28.           Ld. Counsel for the complainant sumitted that the accused has himself
admitted that he required loan and thus, it is established that the complainant
advanced loan to the accused. However, the accused has stated that he needed
loan of Rs.1 Lac and not Rs.4.5 Lacs. Further, merely because the accused needed
money, it does not mean that the complainant had advanced loan to him. Thus, this
argument of Ld. Counsel for the complainant is dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_43">Legal Notice:
</p>
<p id="p_44">29.           It is the case of the accused that he did not receive the legal notice.
However, he has admitted in his plea of guilt that "I do not received the above said
legal notice. However, the first address mentioned on the legal notice is my correct
address." The complainant has also placed on record postal receipts Ex. CW-1/E
and Ex. CW-1/F to prove that the legal notice was sent. <a href="/doc/1428703/" id="a_42">Section 27</a> General Clauses
Act and <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_43">Section 114</a> Indian Evidence Act raise a presumption of due service if the
notice is sent at the correct address. Thereafter, the burden to prove that notice was
received shifts on the accused. However, the accused has not led any evidence to
prove the same. Thus, it is established that legal notice was duly served upon the
accused. This plea of the accused is dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_45">Defence of the accused:
</p><p id="p_46">30.           Ld. Counsel for the accused submitted that the complainant had taken
the cheque in question as security on a condition that he will arrange a bank loan for
the accused. However, the accused has not led any evidence to prove the same.
</p>

<p id="p_47">C.C. No. 1828/16                    Dated 28.08.2018                         Page 11/13
 Thus, he has not been able to prove that the cheque was taken by the complainant
to arrange bank loan.
</p>

<p id="p_48">31.           At this stage, it is imperative to mention the law laid down in the case
of <a href="/doc/1891718/" id="a_44">Bharat Barrel &amp; Drum Manufacturing Company v. Amin Chand Payrelal</a> 1999 (3)
SCC 35 which is as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">               "Upon consideration of various judgments as noted hereinabove, the
       position of law which emerges is that once execution of the promissory note is
       admitted, the presumption under <a href="/doc/1177058/" id="a_45">section 118(a)</a> would arise that it is supported by
       a consideration. Such a presumption is rebuttable. The defendant can prove the
       non-existence of a consideration by raising a probable defence. If the defendant is
       proved to have discharged the initial onus of proof showing that the existence of
       consideration was improbable or doubtful or the same was illegal, the onus would
       shift to the plaintiff who will be obliged to prove it as a matter of fact and upon its
       failure to prove would disentitle him to the grant of relief on the basis of the
       negotiable instrument. The burden upon the defendant of proving the non-
       existence of the consideration can be either direct or by bringing on record
       preponderance of probabilities by reference to the circumstances upon which he
       relies. In such an event, the plaintiff is entitled under law to rely upon all the
       evidence led in the case including that of the plaintiff as well. In case, where the
       defendant fails to discharge the initial onus of proof by showing the non-existence
       of the consideration, the plaintiff would invariably be held entitled to the benefit of
       presumption arising under <a href="/doc/1177058/" id="a_46">section 118(a)</a> in his favour. The court may not insist
       upon the defendant to disprove the existence of consideration by leading evidence
       as the existence of negative evidence is neither possible not contemplated and
       even if led, it is to be seen with a doubt..."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_49">32.           It is settled law of criminal jurisprudence that the complainant has to
prove his case beyond reasonable doubt and the accused has to prove his defence
on the balance of probabilities. In cases under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_47">section 138</a> NI Act, the complainant
gets the benefit of presumptions under <a href="/doc/1177058/" id="a_48">section 118(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_49">139</a> NI Act but that does
not mean that undue benefit will be given to the complainant. Even in cases where
presumptions shift the burden on the accused, the standard of proof remains the
same and the accused may displace its burden not only by proving his case but also
by destroying the case of the complainant.
</p>

<p id="p_50">33.           In the case at hand, the alleged loan amount was paid in cash. There
was no document executed to record the advancement of loan. The loan amount
was not mentioned in the income tax returns. The complainant could not establish
his financial capacity to show that he was capable of advancing loan of
Rs.4,50,000/-. Although, the accused did not lead DE but he has succeeded in

C.C. No. 1828/16                       Dated 28.08.2018                                   Page 12/13
 rebutting the presumption under <a href="/doc/268919/" id="a_50">section 139</a> of the Act by disproving the case of the
complainant. As per Bharat Barrel case, it is not important that the accused leads
his evidence if he can prove his case by disproving the case of the complainant. On
evaluation of the entire evidence, this court finds the version of the complainant is
not only improbable but the alleged transaction is also illegal. The complainant has
not been able to establish that there was a legal debt or liability standing on the part
of the accused towards the complainant. Thus, the most important ingredient
of <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_51">section 138</a> Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 has not been fulfilled.
</p>

<p id="p_51">Decision:-
</p>
<p id="p_52">34.           In view of the above discussion, the accused is acquitted for the
