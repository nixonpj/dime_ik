<div class="doc_title">WPMS/366/2019 on 19 February, 2019</div><pre id="pre_1">WPMS No.366 of 2019
with
WPMS No. 368 of 2019
Hon'ble Manoj K. Tiwari, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">      Mr. Deepak Rawat, Advocate for the
petitioner.
</p><p id="p_2">      Since common questions of fact and
law are involved in both these petitions,
therefore, both the petitions are clubbed
together and are being heard &amp; decided by a
common judgment. However, for the sake of
convenience, facts of WPMS No. 366 of 2019
are being considered.
</p><p id="p_3">      Respondent no. 1, namely, Islam filed a
claim petition under <a href="/doc/32775809/" id="a_1">Section 140</a>/<a href="/doc/136948773/" id="a_2">166</a> of the
Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 before the Motor
Accident     Claims     Tribunal,    Haridwar,
claiming compensation of ` 34,50,000/- on
account of death of his wife Smt. Shahina,
which was registered as MAC No. 101 of
2017. In his claim petition, respondent no. 1
pleaded that, while returning from Kaliyar to
Rishikesh, his wife was a pillion rider in
motorcycle, bearing registration No. UK-07-
R-8155 and a Tata Safari, bearing
registration No. DL-FCV-0555, hit the
motorcycle and a Dumper (Truck), bearing
registration No. UK-13CA-0165, coming from
back side ran over his wife who died due to
injures sustained in the said accident. The
driver,    owner    and     insurer   (National
Insurance Company Ltd.) of the Dumper
(Truck) were impleaded as respondents to
the said claim petition.
</p><p id="p_4">      Petitioner      (National      Insurance
Company Ltd.) filed a written statement
admitting that the Dumper (Truck) has been
insured by it, however, it contended that the
accident took place due to negligence of the
driver of Tata Safari car, therefore, he is not
 liable to pay any compensation. He further
contended that the owner and insurer of
motorcycle as well as Tata Safari car are
necessary parties, therefore, the claim
petition is defective due to non-joinder of
necessary parties.
</p><p id="p_5">      Petitioner,      thereafter,    filed    an
application for impleading the owner and
insurer of the motorcycle and the Tata Safari
car with the contention that they are
necessary parties to the claim petition. The
said application has been rejected by the
learned      Tribunal      vide    order    dated
08.10.2018, which is impugned in this
petition.
</p><p id="p_6">      The sole question, which falls for
consideration in these petitions, is that in
case of composite negligence, where an
accident involves two or more vehicles,
whether owner and insurer of all the vehicles
are necessary party to a claim petition?
</p><p id="p_7">      Learned counsel for the petitioner
submits that owner and insurer of
motorcycle and Tata Safari car are necessary
party to the claim petition, inasmuch as, in
their absence, there can be no determination
regarding the extent of their negligence and
their liability for the claim.
</p><p id="p_8">      Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of
United India Fire &amp; General Insurance
Company Ltd. Vs. Varghese, reported in
(1989) 2 ACC 483, has held that in case of
composite negligence, the claimant has
option to proceed against all or any one of
the joint tortfeasors, therefore, the insurer
cannot take a defence that action is not
sustainable, as the other joint tortfeasors
have not been made parties.
</p><p id="p_9">      In the case of Andhra Marine Exports
(P) Ltd. Vs. P. Radhakrishnan, reported in
A.I.R. 1984 Mad 358, it has been held that
 every wrongdoer is liable for whole damages
in the case of composite negligence if it is
otherwise made out.
</p><p id="p_10">      In the case of Khenyei Vs. New India
Assurance Company Ltd. &amp; others, reported
in (2015) 9 SCC 273, Hon'ble Supreme Court
has approved the view taken by Full Bench
of Madhya Pradesh High Court in Sushila
Bhadoriya Vs. M.P. SRTC, reported in (2005)
1 MPLJ 372, where it was held that in case
of composite negligence, the joint tortfeasors
will be jointly and severally liable to pay the
compensation and further that the claimant
may implead the owner, driver and insurer
of both the vehicles or any one of them.
</p><p id="p_11">      In the case of Khenyei (Supra), Hon'ble
Supreme Court summarized the legal
position in paragraph nos. 21 &amp; 22, which
are extracted below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "21. The same analogy can be applied
     to the instant cases as the liability of
     the joint tortfeasor is joint and several.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     In    the   instant    case,    there   is
     determination of inter se liability of
     composite negligence to the extent of
     negligence of 2/3rd and 1/3rd of
     respective drivers. Thus, the vehicle -</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">     trailor-truck which was not insured
     with the insurer, was negligent to the
     extent of 2/3rd. It would be open to the
     insurer being insurer of the bus after
     making payment to claimant to recover
     from the owner of the trailor-truck the
     amount to the aforesaid extent in the
     execution proceedings. Had there been
     no determination of the inter se liability
     for want of evidence or other joint
     tortfeasor had not been impleaded, it
     was not open to settle such a dispute
     and to recover the amount in execution
 proceedings but the remedy would be
to file another suit or appropriate
proceedings in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_13">22. What emerges from the aforesaid
discussion is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_14">22.1 In the case of composite
negligence, plaintiff/claimant is entitled
to sue both or any one of the joint
tortfeasors and to recover the entire
compensation as liability of joint
tortfeasors is joint and several.
</p>
<p id="p_15">22.2 In the case of composite
negligence,      apportionment       of
compensation between two tortfeasors
vis-a-vis the plaintiff/claimant is not
permissible. He can recover at his
option whole damages from any of
them.
</p>
<p id="p_16">22.3 In case all the joint tortfeasors
have been impleaded and evidence is
sufficient,   it   is    open    to   the
court/tribunal to determine inter se
extent of composite negligence of the
drivers. However, determination of the
extent of negligence between the joint
tortfeasors is only for the purpose of
their inter se liability so that one may
recover the sum from the other after
making whole of payment to the
plaintiff/claimant to the extent it has
satisfied the liability of the other. In
case both of them have been impleaded
and the apportionment/ extent of their
negligence has been determined by the
court/tribunal, in main case one joint
tortfeasor can recover the amount from
the other in the execution proceedings.
</p><p id="p_17">         22.4 It would not be appropriate for
        the court/tribunal to determine the
        extent of composite negligence of the
        drivers of two vehicles in the absence of
        impleadment of other joint tortfeasors.
        In such a case, impleaded joint
        tortfeasor should be left, in case he so
        desires, to sue the other joint tortfeasor
        in independent proceedings after
        passing of the decree or award."
</p>
<p id="p_18">      There can be no doubt from the above
proposition of law that in a case where joint
tortfeasors are not impleaded, the impleaded
joint tortfeasors will still have a remedy to
sue     the   other    joint   tortfeasors   in
independent proceedings after passing of the
award.
</p><p id="p_19">      Having regard to the aforesaid legal
position, this Court finds no infirmity in the
order passed by the learned Tribunal,
whereby      petitioner's    application    for
impleading the owner and insurer of the
other vehicles involved in the accident was
rejected.
</p><p id="p_20">      In view of aforesaid, the writ petitions
fail and are dismissed as such.
</p><p id="p_21">      There will be no order as to costs.</p><pre id="pre_2">


                            (Manoj K. Tiwari, J.)
