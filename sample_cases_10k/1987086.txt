ORAL
ORDER</pre> 

 

<p id="p_1">(Per
: HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE A.L.DAVE)
 

 


 
	  

An
	order was passed by this Court on 4th September 2009 on
	basis of a statement made by the learned Additional Advocate
	General, which required that the Judges of the Labour Courts and
	Industrial Tribunals be paid all allowances and fringe benefits
	recommended by the Shetty Pay Commission with effect from
	01.11.1999, and that, the arrears on that basis for the period from
	01.11.1999 till 31.08.2009 be paid by 5th October 2009.
	The State Government was also directed to continue to pay such
	allowances and fringe benefits for the period from 1.9.2009 every
	month regularly.
</p>	 


	 

<p id="p_2">(1.1)		Since
	the above order was not implemented and the matter was adjourned
	from time to time, on 7.12.2009, this Court passed an order
	directing that if the directions contained in order dated 4th
	September 2009 are not complied with within one month from the date
	of that order, the Chief Secretary, Government of Gujarat and the
	Secretary, Legal Department shall remain personally present before
	this Court on 12th January 2010.
</p>	 


	 

<p id="p_3">(1.2)		The
	matter continued to get listed and adjourned from time to time
	thereafter on 27th January 2010, 3rd February
	2010, 10th February 2010, 16th February 2010
	and then today.  
</p>	
	 


	 

<p id="p_4">(1.3)		Neither
	the order dated 4th September 2009 has been complied with
	nor the second part of the order dated 7th December 2009
	was complied with.  This Court, therefore, insisted upon compliance
	of the said orders, and upon request of learned Assistant Government
	Pleader, the matter was adjourned to the second half of the day.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_5">Learned
	Government Pleader is present.  The Secretary, Legal Department is
	also present.  We notice that still there is non-compliance of the
	order dated 7th December 2009 to the extent that the
	Chief Secretary is not present before us.
</p>	 


	 

<p id="p_6">(2.1)		Learned
	Government Pleader has indicated to us that the Government has
	passed a resolution on 8th January 2010 to extend the
	benefits of Shetty Pay Commission to the petitioners.  Pursuant
	thereto, the financial requirement has been obtained from Registrar
	of the Industrial Tribunal and that has been forwarded forthwith by
	the Legal Department to the Finance Department and other
	Departments. Learned Government Pleader states that the revised
	estimates have been prepared and will be placed before the Assembly
	in the forthcoming session.  Once they are sanctioned, the amount
	would be disbursed to concerned Department.  Learned Government
	Pleader is not in a position to make a statement as to what further
	time would be consumed in undertaking this exercise.  Fact remains
	that the benefit which was required to be extended by 5th
	of October 2009 by virtue of an order of this Court, has not been
	extended to the petitioners and the steps have not been taken till
	January 2010 in direction of its implementation.  Learned Government
	Pleader seeks time till Monday to enable him to make a positive
	statement in this regard.  
</p>	
	 


	 

<p id="p_7">(2.2)		The
	petitioners in Special Civil Application No.10808 of 2009 have
	prayed for grant of benefit under notification dated 26th
	June 2009 (Annexure  D  to the petition).  Learned Government
	Pleader is directed to take instructions on the question as to how
	much time would be required for implementing the same qua the
	petitioners.  Incidentally, we may record that learned Government
	Pleader, during the course of hearing, stated that there is no issue
	or hesitation on entitlement of the petitioners to the benefits
	under the said notification.
</p>	 


	  

<p id="p_8">We
	grant time to the learned Government Pleader, as prayed for by him,
	till 22nd February 2010 to enable him to come out with
	specific instructions on the points indicated above.
</p>	 


	 

<p id="p_9">(3.1)		We
	take a serious note of the fact that inspite of our insistence, the
	order dated 7th December 2009 is only partly complied
	with, in the sense that, only the Secretary, Legal Department is
	present before us.  We also make it clear that if on next occasion,
	learned Government Pleader is not in a position to come out with
	specific instructions, we shall be required to pass appropriate
	order to ensure compliance of the orders of this Court.
</p>	 


	 

<p id="p_10">S.O.
</p><p id="p_11">	to 22nd February 2010.
