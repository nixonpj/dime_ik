has filed the chargesheet against the accused for the

offences punishable U/ss.498(A), 323, 504, 506 r/w 34 of

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a> and u/s.4 of <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_3">Dowry Prohibition Act</a>.


</p><p id="p_2">   2. The case of the prosecution briefly stated as
follows:
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">    The marriage of the accused with Cw.1 performed on

26/11/1997 at Railway Colony, Immaculate Conception

Church as per the custom prevailing in their community.

After the marriage accused on the guise of his ill will

admitted to the Hospital and thereafter he picked up quarrel
                                  3                   C.C.9245/2009

with Cw.1 and sent Cw.1 to her parental house. Thereafter

Cw.1 not returned to matrimonial home for sometimes.

Thereafter one day when Cw.1 went to the house of the

accused at that time the accused picked up quarrel with

Cw.1 and assaulted her with hands and voluntarily caused

her simple injuries and also gave life threat to her. The

accused has given ill treatment to Cw.1 both mentally and

physically.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">   3. Based on the private complaint lodged by Cw.1, case

is referred u/s.156(3) of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_4">Cr.P.C</a>. to the Station House Officer

of Byatarayanapura Police Station. Byatarayanapura Police

Station Police registered the case in Crime No.465/2008 and

dispatched    FIR   to   the   Court.   The   I.O.    recorded   the

statements of the witnesses. The I.O. after completion of

investigation has filed chargesheet only against the accused

No.1 for the offences punishable U/ss.498(A), 323, 504, 506

r/w 34 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a>.
</p><p id="p_7">                                   4                C.C.9245/2009

</p><p id="p_8">    4. The accused No.2 to 4 left out from the chargesheet.

Accused No.1 who engaged counsel released on bail.

Chargesheet copies duly furnished to the accused and

thereby the provision u/s.207 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">Cr.P.C</a>., is complied with.

After hearing on both sides charge came to be framed for

the offences punishable U/ss.498(A), 323,504, 506 r/w 34 of

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a> for which accused pleaded not guilty and claimed for

trial.
</p>
<p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">    5. During the course of trial on the side of the

prosecution      complainant/victim   examined     as   Pw.1   and

documents Ex.p1 to p8 are marked. Inspite of repeated

summons and warrant issued to the Cw.2 to Cw.8 they have

not secured. After closure of the evidence on the side of the

prosecution statement u/s.313 of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_8">Cr.P.C</a>., is recorded.

Accused denied the incriminating evidence. No defence

evidence is led.
</p>
<p id="p_11">         6. I heard the arguments on both sides.
</p>
<p id="p_12">         7. The following points arise for my consideration:
</p><p id="p_13">                                     5                     C.C.9245/2009

</p><p id="p_14">  1.Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable

doubt that the accused has given ill treatment to Cw.1 both

mentally    and    physically   and     subjected    her     cruelty   and

assaulted her with hands and voluntarily caused her simple

injuries and abused her in filthy language and gave life threat

to her and thereby the accused has committed the offences

punishable U/ss.498(A), 323, 504, 506 r/w 34 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">IPC</a>?

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      2. What Order?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">               8. My findings on the above points:

                   Point No.1: In the negative

                   Point No.2: As per final order

                            ::REASONS::
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">
</blockquote><p id="p_15">      9. Point No.1: Pw.1 is the complainant and victim. It is

the case of the prosecution is that the accused has given ill

treatment     to   Cw.1     both    mentally   and        physically   and

subjected her to cruelty and also assaulted her with hands

and caused her simple injuries and abused her in filthy

language and gave life threat to her. Pw.1 even though in

her    examination     in   chief   supported       the    case   of   the
                               6               C.C.9245/2009

prosecution but in her cross examination she is completely

go by the case of the prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">  10. Pw.1 in her examination in chief deposed that her

marriage with the accused took place on 26/11/1997. She

states that accused and his mother demanded Rs.1,00,000/-

in cash, but they agreed to pay only Rs.75,000/-. She states

that after fulfilled the demands of the accused his marriage

and performed with the accused. She states that after the

marriage the accused lead happy marriage life with her for 6

months.   Thereafter   he   started   to   demand   cash      of

Rs.3,00,000/-. She states that when she expressed the

inability of her father to pay that much of amount then the

accused started to give ill treatment to her. She states that

her parents requested to wait for two months to fulfill the

demands of the accused. Thereafter after lapse of two

months her parents were not fulfilled the demands, hence

the accused again started to give ill treatment to her and

subjected her to cruelty. She states that she was not in a

position to tolerate the ill treatment given by the accused,
                               7              C.C.9245/2009

hence she left her husband house and came to back to her

parental house. She states that thereafter on few occasion

her husband visited her parental house during that time also

he was abusing her family members and was insisting to

fulfill his demands. She states that the accused addicted to

Alcohol and under the influence of Alcohol he used to picke

up quarrel with her. She states that in the year 2005

accused filed Divorce Petition against her, but thereafter he

withdrawn the case by saying that he will take back her to

his house. She states that in the year 2007 she met the

accused at Mysore Road and traced his house and tried to

joined him, but the accused again demanded the money and

not allowed her to enter his house and also threatened that

he would marry another lady if the demands are not fulfilled.

She states that hence she filed the Private Complaint as per

Ex.p1. She is identified the Photos which are marked at

Ex.p2 to Ex.p8.
</p>
<p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">   11. During the course of cross examination by the

learned counsel for the accused Pw.1 admitted the fact that
                               8              C.C.9245/2009

even though she was not willing to marry the accused, by

force her marriage was performed with the accused. She is

admitted the fact that since her marriage was performed by

force there was no mutual understanding between her and

the accused. She is admitted the fact that due to lack of

understanding they were quarrel with each other. She is

admitted that the her marriage with the accused is dissolved

by way of Decree of Divorce passed by the Court. She is

admitted the fact that she and accused residing separately

and she is admitted the fact that after two months of their

marriage they started to live separately and thereafter not

to joined. She is admitted the fact that the accused has not

given any ill treatment to her either mentally or physically.

She is admitted the fact that the accused has not abused in

her filthy language and not gave life threat to her. Even

though learned Sr.APP cross examined Pw.1 in detail,

nothing is elicited from her mouth to support the case of the

prosecution.
</p><p id="p_20">                                9               C.C.9245/2009

</p><p id="p_21">  12. Pw.1 is the important witness. Even though she

supported the case of the prosecution in her examination in

chief but in her cross examination by learned counsel for the

accused she is completely go by the case of the prosecution.

The wavering version of Pw.1 creates doubt about her

version. During the course of cross examination by learned

Sr.APP Pw.1 is admitted the fact that she is compromised

the case with the accused. Pw.1 and the accused may set

right their differences, hence Pw.1 may not supported the

case of the prosecution for which the prosecution cannot be

blamed. In this case inspite of sufficient opportunity given to

the prosecution the prosecution could not examined Cw.2 to

Cw.8 which is fatal to the case of the prosecution. The oral

evidence of Pw.1 is not sufficient to hold that the accused

has committed the offences punishable u/ss.498(A), 323,

504, 506 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a>. The prosecution is failed to prove the case

against the accused for the offences punishable U/ss.498(A),

323, 504, 506 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11">IPC</a>. The prosecution is failed to bring
                                  10                C.C.9245/2009

home the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt.

Hence, I answered Point No.1 in the negative.


</p><p id="p_22">   13. Point No.2: In the result, I proceed to pass the

following:
</p>
<p id="p_23">                            ::ORDER::
