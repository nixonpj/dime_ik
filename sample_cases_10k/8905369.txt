Judgment on             :     July 25, 2018


Joymalya Bagchi, J. :

      The appeals are directed against judgment and order dated 15.12.2014

passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court, Cooch Behar

in Sessions Trial No. 03(October) 2009 arising out of Sessions Case No. 158 of

2009 convicting the appellant in CRA 10 of 2015 for commission of offences

punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">Sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_2">34</a> and <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_3">498A</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_4">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code and
 sentencing her to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of

Rs.10,000/- for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_5">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_6">34</a> of the Indian

Penal Code and to suffer simple imprisonment for three years and to pay a fine

of Rs.5,000/-, in default to suffer simple imprisonment for six months more

for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_7">Sections 498A</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_8">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code.

Both the sentences to run concurrently.

      By the self-same judgment and order, the appellants in CRA 4 of 2015

were convicted for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_9">Sections 498A</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_10">34</a> of the

Indian Penal Code and directed to suffer simple imprisonment for three years

and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- each, in default to suffer simple imprisonment

for six months more.

      The prosecution case, as alleged against the appellants is to the effect that

the victim Namita Barman was married to Ashutosh Barman on 27.3.2008 as

per Hindu rites and customs. At the time of marriage, Naresh Chandra Barman

(P.W.1), father of the victim girl gave Rs.30,000/- cash, motorcycle, gold finger

ring, gold ornaments, furniture and fixtures to the appellants as dowry.

      After the marriage the victim started residing at the matrimonial home. A

female child was born to the couple. After the birth of the child the appellants

demanded Rs.50,000/- for business purpose. Father of the victim failed to pay

the said money.    Victim was subjected to mental and physical torture.        The

victim narrated such incidents of torture to her father and other relations when

she came to her parental home. One month prior to the incident the victim was

assaulted and driven out of her matrimonial home.        She took shelter at her

parental home and her father decided to start a criminal case against the
 appellants. Thereupon the victim was brought back to the matrimonial home 15

days prior to the incident. On 23.03.2008 in the evening father of the victim

received information that his daughter had suffered burn injuries. He went to

the hospital along with his relations. Victim informed them that in the afternoon

her mother-in-law had poured kerosene on her and set her on fire.        Over the

incident Naresh Chandra Barman (P.W. 1) lodged first information report being

Dinhata Police Station Case No. 99 of 2008 dated 27.03.2008 under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_11">Sections

498A</a>/<a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_12">326</a>/<a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_13">307</a> of the Indian Penal Code against the appellants.       On the self-

same day, dying declaration of the victim was recorded in the hospital in the

presence of P.W. 17, a doctor. Victim expired on 31.03.2008 and <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_14">section 302</a> of

the Indian Penal Code was added to the array of offences.

      In conclusion of investigation, charge-sheet was filed against the accused

persons. The case being a sessions triable one was committed to the Court of

Sessions and was transferred to the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge, Fast

Track Court, Cooch Behar for trial and disposal. Charges were framed under

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_15">Sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_16">34</a> and under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_17">Sections 498A</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_18">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code against

the appellants who pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

      In the course of trial, prosecution examined 19 witnesses and exhibited a

number of documents. Plea of the appellants was one of innocence and false

implication. In conclusion of trial, learned Trial Judge by judgment and order

dated 15.12.2014 convicted and sentenced the appellants, as aforesaid.

      Mr. Sanyal, learned senior Counsel appearing for the appellants argued

that the prosecution has not been able to prove that the victim was tortured over

demands of dowry. No contemporaneous complaint was lodged by the father or

other relations of the victim over such issue. He referred to the evidence on
 record to show that there was cordial relation between the families and the

allegation of torture upon the victim on demands of dowry was wholly untenable.

      Coming to the dying declarations of the victim, he drew my attention to the

noting by Dr. Kolay on 23.03.2008 at 7.25 pm in the bed head ticket of the

victim to the effect that the victim was "not fit for dying declaration". Relying on

such noting senior Counsel argued that the evidence of prosecution witnesses

that the victim made an oral dying declaration to them was highly unreliable. He

also submitted that the written dying declaration recorded on 27.03.2008 had

not been proved in accordance with law. Executive Magistrate who recorded the

dying declaration had not been examined. Even the purported signatories to the

said dying declaration have not supported the said declaration.

      On the other hand, the evidence has come on record that the appellant

Sabitri was not at the place of occurrence at the time of incident and P.W. 12

deposed that the victim stated to the doctor that she had caught fire during

cooking. He, accordingly, prayed for acquittal.

      Learned Counsel for the State argued that the victim was subjected to

torture on further demands of dowry. On 23.03.2008, while she was cooking, her

mother-in-law poured kerosene on her and set her on fire. She was admitted to

the hospital. When P.Ws. 1, 2, 3 and 7 came to the hospital, she informed them

of the incident. She again made oral dying declaration to P.Ws. 4 and 8 on

subsequent dates. On 27.03.2008 her dying declaration was recorded by

executive magistrate in presence of doctor (P.W. 17). Hence, the appeals are

liable to be dismissed and conviction and sentence of the appellants may be

upheld.

      Let me examine the rival versions in the light of the evidence on record.
       P.W. 1, Naresh Chandra Barman, is the father of the victim and the

informant of the instant case.   He deposed that his daughter was married to

Asutosh Barman according to Hindu rites and customs.          He gave cash of

Rs.30,000/- one motor cycle, gold ornaments weighing two bhoris, cot, furniture

etc. as dowry. The members of the in-law's house tortured his daughter both

physically and mentally as further demand of Rs.50,000/- was not met by him.

His daughter narrated the demand to him when she came to his house. He sent

his daughter to her in-law's house. She was tortured there and again took refuge

at his residence.   Thereafter his son-in-law assured him she would not be

tortured at the matrimonial home and she returned to the matrimonial home.

On the day of the incident he received information from neighbours that Sabitri,

mother-in-law of his daughter, had poured kerosene oil on her wearing apparels

and set her on fire. His daughter narrated the incident to him while she was

admitted at Dinhata hospital. From the wedlock a female child had been born to

the couple. He filed complaint four days after the incident. One Dipak Sen wrote

the written complaint and he put his signature thereon. Police interrogated him.

His daughter died seven days after admission in the hospital.         In cross-

examination, he stated after conception his daughter stayed at her in-law's

house.   He and his wife visited his daughter 15 to 16 times.       Rice taking

ceremony of his grand daughter was celebrated in the house of the accused

persons. None of the accused persons were present when he went to the hospital.

      P.W. 2, Manik Chandra Barman, is the brother of the victim. He deposed

that the victim was married to Asutosh Barman three/four years ago. At the time

of marriage cash of Rs. 30,000, one motor cycle, furniture and utensils were

given. His sister started residing at her matrimonial home. A female child was
 born to the couple. After birth of the child the husband and other family

members demanded Rs.50,000/- to start a new cycle shop with the said amount.

His sister returned to their house. They threatened that they would file a case

against the appellants. Thereupon, Asutosh gave assurance that his sister will

not be subjected to torture. On 23.03.2008 between 2.00 to 2.30 p.m., his sister

was cooking in the kitchen. At that time mother-in-law poured kerosene oil on

the wearing apparels of the sister and set her on fire. On hearing the news they

rushed to the hospital. His sister narrated the incident to him. After four days of

the incident his father filed a complaint at the police station. Sister died in the

hospital on 31.08.2008.    Police held inquest over the body of the sister. He

signed on the inquest report marked as Ext.-2/1. Inquest was also held by the

learned Magistrate.   He signed on that report marked as Ext. 3/1.       In cross-

examination, he stated that he went to her in-law's house three times after the

marriage. He stayed in the hospital continuously for a few days. His niece is

residing with the appellants at present.

      P.W. 3, Rajkanta Barman, is a neighbour of P.W. 1.         He deposed that

Asutosh married Namita four years ago. A female child was born to the couple.

Asutosh demanded money from his father-in-law. The victim was subjected to

torture. When the victim was staying at the matrimonial home, her mother-in-

law had set her on her. He went to see the victim while she was admitted at

Dinhata hospital. The victim told her that while she was preparing rice in the

kitchen her mother-in-law had set her on fire.

      P.W. 4, Atis Barman, is the brother-in-law of the victim. He deposed that

the victim was married four years ago with Asutosh. A female child was born to

the couple. He heard that mother-in-law of the victim set her wearing apparels
 on fire while she was cooking. He heard the incident from P.W. 2. Two days

after the incident he went to the hospital and the victim narrated the incident to

him. In cross-examination he stated that he went to the hospital in the evening

at 8p.m.

      P.W. 5, Gunadhar Laskar, is another neighbour who was declared hostile

and was cross-examined with regard to his previous statement before police.

      P.W. 6, Ajoy Bhattacharjee, is a priest who solemnized the marriage

between the victim and Asutosh. He deposed that he heard that the mother-in-

law of the victim had set her on fire and as a result she died.

      P.W. 7, Binodini Barman, is another neighbour of the victim. She deposed

that Namita was married to Asutosh four years ago.         During her stay at the

matrimonial home she was ill-treated. Namita informed such fact to the witness.

The accused persons had demanded Rs.50,000/- as dowry.            Her father was

unable to meet the demand. As a result, she was subjected to torture. She went

to the hospital and Namita told her that her mother-in-law poured oil and set her

on fire. In cross-examination, she stated that she reached the hospital around 5

to 6 p.m. on that date.

      P.W. 8, Sushil Sen, is also a neighbour of the victim. He deposed that a

female child was born to the couple. He heard about the incident from the son of

Naresh, P.W. 1. Four days after the incident he went to the hospital and the

victim narrated the incident to him. In cross-examination, he stated when he

went to the hospital he found the victim in bed and she was able to speak. He

also stated that he saw burn of injuries on the face, up to elbows of both the

hands, all the fingers were blackish in colour and bent.
       P.Ws. 9, 11 and 12 were tendered for cross examination. In cross

examination, P.W. 9 deposed that on the date of incident he was cultivating his

land situated two bighas away from the residence of Kamalakanta, father in law

of the victim. Land of Kamalakanta is adjacent to his land. Kamalakanta and his

wife were working in the land. He went to the hospital after the incident. He

found both the hands of the victim were burnt along with palms and nails and

fingers. He asked the victim how she caught fire. She could not state how she

sustained burn injuries. He saw the parents and brother of the victim to whom

the latter was talking.

      P.W.11 is a neighbour of the appellants. In cross examination, he stated

that upon hearing a hue and cry, he came to the house of the appellants and

found Kamalakanta and his wife were uprooting 'kalai' outside the house. Other

family members were trying to extinguish fire.

      P.W.12 in cross examination stated that she had gone to the hospital on

the day the victim was admitted. She remained in the hospital up to midnight.

Parents and brother of Namita came to the hospital. None else came to the

hospital when she was at the hospital. They had a talk with Namita in the

hospital and in her presence Namita stated before the doctor that she caught fire

while cooking.

      P.W.13 Bijon Kr. Dutta held post mortem over the victim. He found

extensive old burn injuries with slough form involving anteior chest wall, anterior

abdominal wall, both upper and lower limbs covering almost 60% of the body. He

opined death was due to toxemia following the burn injuries. He proved post

mortem report (Ext. 4).
       P.W.14 was an ASI of police attached to Dinhata P.S. He conducted

enquiry with regard to Dinhata PS UD case no. 38/08 and held inquest over the

dead body (Ext. 2). He sent the dead body through constable Chandreswar

Barman for post mortem examination.

      P.W.15 Chandreswar Barman carried the dead body for post mortem

examination.

      P.W.16 was the executive magistrate who conducted inquest over the body

of the victim (Ext. 3).

      P.W.17 Dr. S. Roy was a medical officer attached to Dinhata S.D hospital.

On 27.3.2008 he was posted in the same capacity. On that day Namita, an

indoor patient was in the hospital in burnt condition. He examined the patient

and declared her fit to give dying declaration. He asked her some questions. Sri

M.N. Sarkar, Executive Magistrate recorded dying declaration of the patient in

his presence. Dying declaration was recorded in his presence. He proved his

signature on the dying declaration (Ext. 6). One sister of the hospital and some

relatives of the patient were present at the time of recording dying declaration

      P.W.18 is the investigating officer in the instant case. He deposed that on

27.3.2008</pre><p id="p_1"> I.C received written complaint from one Naresh Chandra Barman and

the investigation was endorsed to him. He drew up formal FIR (Ext. 7). He

examined the available witnesses. He recorded statement of the victim in S.D

hospital, Dinhata. He prayed before SDO Dinhata for recording dying declaration

of the victim. Thereafter M.N. Sarkar, Deputy Magistrate recorded dying

declaration of the victim. He prepared rough sketch map of the place of

occurrence (Exts. 8 and 8/1). On 31.1.2008 Namita Barman expired at the

hospital. He collected the inquest report and post mortem report. He made
 prayer before the court for adding <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_19">section 302</a> IPC. He submitted charge sheet

under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_20">sections 498A</a>/<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_21">302</a> IPC. In cross examination he stated that he was

present at the time of recording dying declaration. Dying declaration does not

bear his signature. He was in the hospital till 2.50 p.m. He did not examine Dr.

Aloke Kumar Koley. No doctor or ward master advised him to get the dying

declarations recorded. He did not make any requisition for any doctor to remain

present at the time of recording dying declaration.
</p>
<p id="p_2">         P.W.19, Sankar Kr. Das was a ward master of Dinhata S.D hospital. He

produced the admission register, bed head ticket, treatment sheet etc. of the

victim

         From the evidence on record it appears that the prosecution case rests

on the dying declaration made by the victim to the prosecution witnesses while

she was admitted in the hospital from 23.3.2008 to 31.3.2008. P.Ws. 1, 2, 3

and 7 claimed that they had gone to the hospital when the victim was

admitted and she narrated to them that while she was cooking her mother in

law i.e Sabitri Barman poured kerosene oil on her wearing apparels and set

her on fire. This is the first dying declaration of the victim. Two days after the

incident P.W. 4, her brother in law visited her in the hospital and the victim

narrated the same incident to him. Similarly, four days after the incident when

P.W. 8, a neighbour visited her, she narrated the same incident to him. On

that day around 1.45 p.m. P.W. 2 lodged written complaint with the I.C,

Dinhata P.S and on receipt of the written complaint Investigating Officer (P.W.

</p><p id="p_3">18) requested the SDO to record her dying declaration and M N. Sarker,

Deputy Magistrate recorded dying declaration of the victim at the hospital
 between 2.20 to 2.45 p.m. in the presence of a doctor P.W. 17 which has been

exhibited as Ext. 6/1.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      Apart form the aforesaid dying declarations, P.W. 12 claimed that the

victim had made an exonerative dying declaration before the doctor on the

date of admission and stated that she caught fire while she was cooking.

</p><p id="p_5">      Learned senior counsel has criticized the aforesaid incriminating dying

declarations on a number of issues. He argued that in the bed head ticket

there is a noting on 23.3.2008 at 7.25 p.m. by one Dr. Koley that the victim

was not fit for making dying declaration. That apart, the dying declaration was

recorded on 27.3.2008 under most suspicious circumstances. M. N. Sarkar,

Deputy Magistrate, who recorded the dying declaration, has not been

examined. It is unclear who had summoned M.N Sarker to record the dying

declaration and none of the signatories to the dying declaration have

supported the document. Even the LTI of the victim on the dying declaration is

doubtful as it appears her fingers were burnt.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      On the other hand there is an inexplicable delay of four days in lodging

FIR which improbabilise the fact that the victim had made oral dying

declarations to her relations and others in the interregnum.

</p><p id="p_7">      I have given anxious thought to the aforesaid contentions. In Atbir Vs.

Government of NCT of Delhi (2010) 9 SCC 1 (para 22), the Apex Court

summarized the law relating to dying declaration as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          "   (i) Dying declaration can be the sole basis of conviction if it inspires
                 the full confidence of the Court.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              (ii) The Court should be satisfied that the deceased was in a fit state of
                 mind at the time of making the statement and that it was not the

</p><p id="p_9">      Coming to the oral dying declaration made by the victim immediately upon

admission at the hospital, I find that the prosecution witnesses including P.W.

10 and P.W. 12 claimed that the victim was conscious and able to speak when

she admitted to the hospital. In fact, she was seen talking to her father and other

relations at that time. Noting in the bed head ticket at 5.20 p.m. also shows that

the patient was conscious at the time of admission. Strong reliance has been

placed on a note purportedly made by Dr. A. K. Kolay on 23.3.2008 at 7.25 P.M.

that the victim was not fit for dying declaration.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      I have considered the said note in the light of the attending facts and

circumstances of the case including other contemporaneous entries made in the
 bed head ticket. Although Dr. Kolay had not been examined in the instant case,

the bed head ticket, treatment sheets and the admission register had been read

into evidence upon consent under <a href="/doc/1086076/" id="a_22">Section 294</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Hence, I have examined the various entries in the bed head ticket which reveals

an interesting sequence of events. On 23.3.2008 a requisition was made by the

Medical Officer of Dinhata S. D. Hospital for recording the dying declaration of

the victim. At the foot of the requisition, an entry was made by Dr. Kolay at 7.20

P.M. directing police personnel to be summoned to record dying declaration.

Most strangely, within five minutes i.e. at 7.25 P.M. the self-same Doctor appears

to have made an endorsement that the patient was not fit for recording dying

declaration. It is inexplicable as to how a Medical Officer who requisitioned police

officer for recording dying declaration, within five minutes could change his mind

and make an endorsement that the patient was not fit for making dying

declaration. On the other hand, the entry made in the bed head ticket at the time

of admission around 5.20 p.m. shows that the patient was conscious. This

probabilises the fact that the patient was conscious at the time of admission on

23.3.2008 around 5/6 p.m. and narrated the incident to her relations and others

who met her at the hospital in the evening. The prevaricating stance of Dr. Kolay

with regard to her lack of fitness to make dying declaration recorded at 7.25 p.m.

does not sound convincing nor does it improbabilise the capacity of the patient to

converse with her relations in the earlier part of the evening around 5/6 p.m.

when it is noted that she was conscious. Overwhelming number of prosecution

witnesses evidence viz., P.Ws. 1, 2, 3, and 7 unequivocally stated that when they

reached the hospital around 5.00 to 6.00 P.M., the victim was conscious and had

narrated the incident to them.
</p><p id="p_11">       In view of such convincing oral evidence on record which is corroborated

by the entry in the bed head ticket that the victim was conscious at the time of

admission, I am of the view that the prosecution has been able to prove that the

victim was conscious and capable of speaking around 5.00 to 6.00 P.M. on the

date of admission, that is, 23.03.2008 and had made oral dying declaration to

P.W. 1, P.W. 2, P.W. 3 and P.W. 7 implicating her mother-in-law as the person

who set her on fire in the afternoon. On subsequent dates, she made similar

dying declarations to P.W. 4 and P.W. 8 when they visited her in the hospital.

Thereafter on 27.3.2008 written complaint was lodged by P.W. 1 with I. C.

Dinhata Police Station. Thereupon, the I.O., P.W. 18 made a requisition to SDO,

Dinhata for recording dying declaration of the victim by an Executive Magistrate.

Accordingly, her dying declaration came to be recorded by M. N. Sarkar between

2.20 to 2.45 P.M. in the presence of the doctor, P.W. 17. Evidence of P.W. 18

clarifies the circumstances in which the aforesaid dying declaration came to be

recorded. P.W. 17, a Doctor attached to Dinhata S. D. Hospital was present when

the said dying declaration was recorded by M. N. Sarkar. He unequivocally stated

that the victim was in a fit state of mind to make the dying declaration. Hence, I

have no doubt in my mind that the written dying declaration (Ext. 6/1) was

recorded in the instant case at a time when the victim was conscious and fit to of

make of such declaration.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      It is true that the signatures of other witnesses in the dying declaration

(apart from P.W. 17) have not been proved. However, such remissness on the

part of the prosecuting counsel cannot cast a doubt on the written dying

declaration which was recorded in the presence of P.W. 17, a Medical Officer.

P.W. 17 has duly proved his endorsement on the document and no suggestion
 has been given that P.W. 17 is a biased or an interested witness. Hence, I

consider it prudent to rely on his evidence to come to a finding that the dying

declaration was duly recorded in the instant case in his presence by M. N.

Sarkar. Although there is some evidence that fingers of the victim were burnt, no

question was put to P.W. 17 or the post mortem doctor, P.W. 13 whether the

severity of the burns on her fingers were such that no thumb impression was

possible. In absence of such deposition, I am loathe to disbelieve that the victim

was unable to affix her thumb impression as argued by the defence (see Krishan

Vs. State of Haryana (2013) 3 SCC 280 (para 24))

      Finally, it has been argued that M. N. Sarkar has not been examined in

this case and the best evidence was withheld from the Court giving rise to an

adverse presumption against the prosecution case. Non-examination of the

author of a document ordinarily would caste doubt as to its execution. In order

to allay any misgivings in this regard, I have gone through the order sheet of the

trial court. I note that the summons was issued to M. N. Sarkar to depose in the

instant case and dates were fixed on 12.1.2012, 10.2.2012, 10.5.2012 and

18.8.2012 to record his deposition. As the public servant had been transferred

and his subsequent place of posting was not known, summons was sought to be

served through the Principal Secretary (Home) PAR, Government of West Bengal,

but his attendance could not be secured. Faced with such a situation, the

prosecution took out an application for exhibiting the dying declaration recorded

by the Deputy Magistrate through the deposition of P.W. 17. Upon hearing the

parties by order dated 15.9.2012, the trial court held that the P.W. 17 was a

competent witness to prove the dying declaration recorded by M. N. Sarkar in his

presence and exhibited it as Ext. 6/1.
</p><p id="p_13">       Learned Senior Counsel has strongly contested the correctness of such

finding. I have examined the evidence of P.W. 17 and I find that the said witness

was present when M. N. Sarkar, Executive Magistrate recorded the dying

declaration in the hospital.

</p><p id="p_16">                 Explanation.--A person is said to be acquainted with the

                 course of business, documents purporting to be written by that
                 person have been habitually submitted to him."(Emphasis supplied)

      A plain reading of the explanation to the aforesaid section would show

when a document is written in the presence of a witness, such witness would be

said to be acquainted with the hand writing of the maker and his evidence is

admissible under <a href="/doc/1463645/" id="a_24">Section 47</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      Hence, I have relied on Ext. 6/1 i.e. the written dying declaration recorded

by M. N. Sarkar as proved by P.W. 17 who was present at the time of its

execution. It is also relevant to note the dying declaration was recorded by the

Deputy Magistrate in discharge of his official duty and a presumption as to its

regularity may also be drawn by the Court in terms of <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_25">Section 114</a> illustration (e)

of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_26">Evidence Act</a>. Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the written dying

declaration of the victim (Ext. 6/1) has been duly proved in the instant case.

</p><p id="p_18">      The written dying declaration reads as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">            "My name is Namita Burman, age 20 years, I have a daughter off

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">            law, husband and two brothers-in-law were present at home.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">            Two years had gone of my marriage. Husband had a shop of

            cycle repairing. After my marriage, I lived at my in-law's house.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">            There was no dispute between my husband and me."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_19">      A plain reading of the said dying declaration shows that the victim while

implicating her mother-in-law, Sabitri, had exonerated her husband, Asutosh.

Had it been a tutored or manufactured document, there was no reason why the

husband would have been spared. Tenor of the dying declaration, therefore,

prompts me to hold that it is a truthful version of the victim which is not a

product of tutoring etc.

      The written dying declaration, therefore, passes the twin test, namely, the

capacity of the victim in making such declaration and its intrinsic truthfulness

so as to inspire confidence and may be relied upon.
</p>
<p id="p_20">      In view of the consistent oral and written dying declarations implicating

the appellant Sabitri in setting the victim on fire, I choose not to give credence to

the desperate attempt on the part of P.W. 12 to exonerate the appellants by

claiming that the victim told in presence of the doctor on the day of admission

that her wearing apparels caught fire while she was cooking. No medical

personnel has supported her version. There is no entry in the contemporaneous

records like bed head ticket, admission register or treatment sheet supporting

her statement. P.W.12 was a neighbour of the accused person and has sought to

manufacture this story of exonerative declaration to save the appellants from

legal punishment. Accordingly, I do not give credence to her uncorroborated
 version in the light of more reliable dying declarations particularly the written

dying declaration recorded in the presence of doctor, P.W. 17 in the instant case.

</p><p id="p_21">      I am, however, inclined to observe that the practice of tendering witnesses

like P.W.9, P.W.11 and P.W.12 as adopted by the prosecution is illegal and

uncalled for and ought not to have been undertaken by the prosecutor in the

instant case.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      It is open to the prosecution to choose its own witnesses who are necessary

for the unfolding of its case. As the prosecution merely tendered P.Ws. 9, 11 and

12 for cross-examination, it is clear that it had given up those witnesses and did

not wish to examine them for the unfolding of its case.
</p>
<p id="p_23">      Under such circumstances, it was unnecessary and uncalled for on the

part of the prosecution to tender the aforesaid witnesses for cross-examination

under the scheme of the new Code (see Sukhwant Singh Vs State of Punjab

(1995) SCC (Cri) 524).
</p>
<p id="p_24">      Referring to the cross-examination of P.Ws.9 and 11 it has been submitted

by the appellants that Kamala Kanta Barman and Sabitri Barman, parents in

law of the victim were not present at the place of occurrence. P.W.9 stated that

they were cultivating their own land which is adjacent to his land situated 2

bighas away from their house, whereas P.W.11 stated that they were outside

their house plucking "Kalai". Patent inconsistency in the versions of these

witnesses with regard to the alibi of the said appellants exposes the hollowness

and falsity of such plea. Hence, I am not inclined to give credence to such plea

and am inclined to rely on the consistent oral as also written dying declarations

implicating Sabitri as the person who set the victim on fire on the fateful day.
</p><p id="p_25">       Coming to the torture on the victim over demands of dowry prosecution

witnesses claimed that an additional sum of Rs.50,000/- was demanded for

setting up a new cycle shop. P.W. 2 claimed that such demand was made by

Asutosh, the husband. Evidence has come on record that the cycle shop

business was run by Asutosh and none of the appellants. On the other hand, the

dying declaration of the victim exonerates Asutosh from subjecting her to any ill-

treatment or torture.
</p>
<p id="p_26">      In view of the variance between the oral evidence of the prosecution

witnesses with regard to the demand of additional sum of Rs.50,000/- primarily

by the husband for a new cycle shop on the one hand and the dying declaration

of the victim exonerating her husband on the other hand, I am constrained to

observe that it is unsafe to rely on such oral evidence regard to the torture on the

victim over demands of additional money to set up a new cycle shop. On the

other hand, the oral and written dying declarations categorically establish

Sabitri, the mother-in-law of the victim, as the person who poured kerosene oil

on the victim and set her on fire.
</p>
<p id="p_27">      In the light of the aforesaid discussion, I am of the view that the conviction

and sentence imposed on the appellant Sabitri (in CRA 10 of 2015), for

commission of offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_27">Sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_28">34</a> of Indian Penal Code

are liable to be upheld.
</p>
<p id="p_28">      Conviction and sentence imposed on all the appellants (including Sabitri)

for commission of offence punishable under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_29">Sections 498A</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_30">34</a> of IPC is set aside.

</p><p id="p_29">      The appellants, namely, Ashutosh Barman, Kamala Kanta Barman, Uttam

Barman, Dipen Barman and Sampa Barman (in CRA 4 of 2015), shall be
 discharged from their bail bonds after six months in terms of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_31">section 437A</a> of
