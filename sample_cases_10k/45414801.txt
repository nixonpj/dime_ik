              -------------------------
             Crl.R.P.No.646 of 2017
          ----------------------------------
       Dated this the 11th day of June, 2018

                       ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     The petitioner herein, who is the respondent in

MC.No.46/2008 of the Judicial First Class magistrate

Court, Ottapalam.      Before the court below, the

petitioner appeared and filed objection. However, he

could not appear before the court below.      Hence on

the basis of uncontravened evidence, the trial court

granted reliefs under the Provisions of Protection of

Women from <a href="/doc/542601/" id="a_1">Domestic Violence Act</a>.             This was

challenged    in   Crl.APpeal285/2015      before    the

Additional Sessions Court, Palakkad.         The lower

appellate court by its judgment dated on 8.11.2016,

allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned order and

remanded the matter for fresh disposal after providing

reasonable opportunity to both        sides to adduce

evidence on condition that the petitioner shall deposit

the entire maintenance amount due to the minor

daughter on the date of filing the petition till the date
Crl.R.P.No.646 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                        2</span>

of judgment calculated @ Rs.1000/- per month as

claimed in the petition, less the amount already

paid/deposited.      The trial court was directed to

dispose of the matter as expeditiously as possible. The

petitioner herein failed to comply with the order.

Hence the order of the trial court stood revived. This

is under challenge in this Crl.R.P.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">     2.    Heard both sides and examined the records.

It is evident that the petitioner herein did not contest

the proceedings for his own reasons.                 Hence the

appellate court felt that the petitioner herein should

be given an opportunity of hearing on merits. I do not

intend to delve deep into the issue whether there was

justifiable reason for the absence of the petitioner. It

is also true that the petitioner could not remit the

entire amount as ordered by the court below.               It was

submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner

that he had deposited the amount              Rs.50,000/- and

the balance amount was not deposited.                      Having

considered    both       claims,   I   feel   that   one    more
Crl.R.P.No.646 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                    3</span>

opportunity can be granted to the petitioner herein to

contest the matter on merits specifically on condition

that no further opportunity will be granted.     In         the

result, the Crl.R.P is allowed, reviving the judgment

of the lower appellate court dated 8.11.2016 subject

to the following conditions:
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">     (1) The matter is remanded to the trial court for

fresh disposal in accordance with law, after giving

reasonable     opportunity   to   both   sides   to   let    in

evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">     (2)     The petitioner herein shall pay and continue

to pay monthly maintenance to the child          @

Rs.1000/- per month and also deposit the entire

arrears of maintenance due to the child as of today

(11.06.2018). It is submitted by the learned counsel

for the petitioner that the total amount due is around

Rs.1,00,000/-, out of which Rs.50,000/- has been

deposited.      The balance amount is liable to be

remitted within one month.         Hence, the petitioner

shall deposit actual arrears of maintenance payable to
Crl.R.P.No.646 of 2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         4</span>

the child calculated @ Rs.1000/- per month in two

equal     monthly        installments        commencing     from

18.06.2018.       The petitioner shall deposit the first

installment within a period of one month from

18.6.2018 and the balance amount within one month

thereafter.    Both sides shall appear before the court

below on 19.7.2018.           On that day, if the court is

satisfied that the first installment has been deposited,

the court shall post the case after one month. In the

interregnum, the petitioner shall completely pay off

the arrears.     The court shall thereafter proceed in

accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">       (3) If the amount is deposited, it shall be

released to the child through mother.
