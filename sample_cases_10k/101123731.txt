SANJIV KHANNA, J.:
</p>
<p id="p_7">1.          Ms. Laurinda Keys Long, the respondent No.1 herein is a

person of Indian origin holding an American passport, who was


WP(C) NO.3783-2008                                                   Page 1
 employed by the Associated Press, the petitioner herein on 11th

October, 1976 in U.S.A. The petitioner is an accredited news agency

with Press Information Bureau and engaged in news collection and

distribution.
</p>
<p id="p_8">2.    The respondent No.1 after employment with the petitioner

worked in various countries as per their directions and requirement as

a Journalist. By letter dated 27th August, 1999, she was transferred

and posted for the first time to India (New Delhi) as a News Editor.

The respondent No.1 was paid wages and salary as per the terms

and conditions of employment from 1976 onwards. It is a case of the

petitioner that even after transfer to India, her salary was paid in US

Dollars in her US account though tax at source was being deducted

and paid to the Indian Government.
</p>
<p id="p_9">3.    The petitioner terminated the services of the respondent No.1

on 30th November, 2004. It is a case of the respondent No.1 that

termination was without any cause or reason.

</p><p id="p_10">4.    The respondent No.1 preferred a petition under <a href="/doc/180729963/" id="a_1">Section 17(1)</a> of

the Working Journalists &amp; Other Newspaper Employees (Conditions

of Service) and <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_2">Miscellaneous Provisions Act</a>, 1955 ( Act, for short)

before the Deputy Labour Commissioner for payment of gratuity by

the respondent No.1. By the impugned order, which bears the date

15th February, 2008, Deputy Labour Commissioner has allowed the

application under <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_3">Section 17</a> (1) of the Act and has directed the



WP(C) NO.3783-2008                                               Page 2
 petitioner to pay gratuity to the respondent No.1 of Rs. 45,10,254/-

along with the interest @ 12% per annum from 23rd December, 2005.

</p><p id="p_11">5.    Two questions arise for consideration in the present writ

petition. Firstly, whether the Act is applicable and secondly, whether

the said order could have been passed by Deputy Labour

Commissioner under <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_4">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act without recourse to

proceedings as contemplated under <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_5">Section 17(2)</a> of the Act.

</p><p id="p_12">6.    <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_6">The Act</a> was enacted to regulate conditions of service of

working journalists, etc. in the newspaper establishments. <a href="/doc/1665284/" id="a_7">Section 1</a>

of the Act states that it extends to whole of India. <a href="/doc/1941999/" id="a_8">Section 2(d)</a> and

<a href="/doc/1941999/" id="a_9">2(f)</a> define the term "newspaper establishment" and "working

Journalists". The said definition clauses are as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  "2(d). "newspaper establishment" means
            an establishment under the control of any
            person or body of persons, whether
            incorporated or not, for the production or
            publication of one or more newspaper or for
            conducting any news agency or syndicate:
            and includes newspaper establishments
            specified as one establishment under the
            Schedule-

            of newspaper establishments shall be treated
            as parts thereof;

            business thereof is to print newspaper;</blockquote><p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">            2(f) "working journalist" means a person
            whose principal avocation is that of a
            journalist and who is employed as such, either
            whole-time or part-time, in, or in relation to,
            one or more newspaper establishments, and

            reporter, correspondent, cartoonist, news-

            include any such person who-
</p>
<p id="p_16">      (i)  is employed mainly in a managerial or
           administrative capacity; or
</p><p id="p_17">      (ii) being employed in a supervisory capacity,
           performs, either by the nature of the duties
           attached to his office or by reason of the
           powers vested in him, functions mainly of a
           managerial nature;"
</p><p id="p_18">7.    On conjoint reading of <a href="/doc/1665284/" id="a_10">Sections 1</a>, <a href="/doc/1941999/" id="a_11">2(d)</a> &amp; (f) of the Act, it is

apparent that relevant provisions of the Act will apply to persons, who

are working journalists within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1941999/" id="a_12">Section 2(f)</a> and are

employed in a newspaper establishment as defined in <a href="/doc/1941999/" id="a_13">Section 2(d)</a> of

the Act. Even if the respondent No.1 was initially appointed as a

working journalist in United States of America in the year 1976, and

on the basis of the said initial appointment was transferred to India

vide letter dated 27th August, 1999, as her services were terminated

on 30th November, 2004 while working in India, she would be

governed and entitled to protection and benefits under the Act. The

contractual terms regulating the employment of respondent No.1 may

have been agreed and settled outside India but once the respondent

No.1 was transferred to India and the petitioner satisfies requirements

of newspaper establishment and the respondent No.1 satisfies the

requirements of a working journalist, the Act will be applicable.

<a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_14">Section 16</a> of the Act in categorical terms states that the provisions of

the Act will have over-riding effect on any other previous law, award,


WP(C) NO.3783-2008                                                Page 4
 agreement or contract of service, which are inconsistent therewith.

More favourable terms are protected.
</p>
<p id="p_19">8.    The Supreme Court in Bennett Coleman and Co. Pvt. Ltd.,

Vs. Punya Priya Das Gupta, AIR 1970 SC 426 had interpreted the

expression "working journalist" in <a href="/doc/1941999/" id="a_15">Section 2(f)</a> of the Act and held that

the said expression is not restricted to a newspaper employee who is

presently employed in a newspaper establishment but the term

includes an ex-employee, whose employment has come to an end.

The first issue, therefore regarding applicability of the Act is decided

in favour of the respondent No.1. It is held that the respondent No.1 is

entitled to protection and benefits under the Act. The petitioner is also

bound by the Act being a newspaper establishment and the

respondent No.1 was a working journalist as defined for the purpose

of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_20">9.    The second issue relates to interpretation of <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_16">Section 17</a> of the
Act and the jurisdiction of Deputy Labour Commissioner to adjudicate
the contentions and defences raised by the petitioner to the
application under <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_17">Section 17</a> (1) of the Act filed by respondent No.1.
<a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_18">Section 17</a> of the Act reads as under:-

<p id="p_22">10.   There is difference between <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_20">Section 17(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_21">Section 17(2)</a> of

the Act. <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_22">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act provides for recovery of an amount

due to a newspaper employee from an employer as arrears of land

revenue. A newspaper employee, for this purpose, is required to

make an application to the State Government or authority appointed

by the State Government, who can issue a certificate for recovery of

the amount through the Collector under the Land Revenue Act. The

State Government or the authority under <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_23">Section 17(1)</a> should be

 satisfied that the amount is due to the newspaper employee before a

certificate is issued.
</p>
<p id="p_23">11.   <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_24">Section 17(2)</a> of the Act stipulates that when any question

arises as to the amount due under the Act to a newspaper employee

from an employer, the State Government on its own motion or on an

application will refer the disputes to the Labour Court under the

<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_25">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947 or corresponding law, if applicable.

<a href="/doc/1632564/" id="a_26">Section 17(2)</a> applies when a dispute arises about the amount due to

the newspaper employee from the employer. The dispute is to be

adjudicated by the Labour Court under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_27">Industrial Disputes Act</a>

after reference is made by the State Government on its own motion

or on an application made. Sub Section (3) to <a href="/doc/678364/" id="a_28">Section 17</a> stipulates

that the amounts determined by the Labour Court under <a href="/doc/1632564/" id="a_29">section 17(2)</a>

can be recovered under <a href="/doc/1905977/" id="a_30">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act. Under Sub-Section

(1) to <a href="/doc/678364/" id="a_31">Section 17</a> of the Act, the State Government or the authority

appointed by the State Government is not competent and authorized

to adjudicate the disputes relating to the amount claimed or due. The

State Government or the authority appointed by the State

Government is not an adjudicating authority and capable of deciding

the disputes on the amount due. The State Government or the

authority cannot adjudicate and determine the rights, accept or reject

the claim or defence by passing a detailed order dealing with the

merits and contentions raised by the parties. In such cases the matter

has to be referred to adjudication under <a href="/doc/1632564/" id="a_32">Section 17(2)</a> of the Act.

 Satisfaction required under <a href="/doc/1905977/" id="a_33">Section 17(1)</a> is not equivalent to; nor

confers jurisdiction to adjudicate disputed questions. The Supreme

Court   in   Kasturi   &amp;   Sons     Pvt.   Ltd.   Versus   Section   N.

Salivateswaran &amp; Others 1959 SCR 1 had examined the provisions

of <a href="/doc/678364/" id="a_34">Section 17</a> of the Act and had observed that the inquiry

contemplated under <a href="/doc/1905977/" id="a_35">Section 17(1)</a> requires a summary inquiry of very

limited nature and is confined to narrow question what is the actual

amount due to be paid to the employee under the decree, award or

any other valid order obtained by the employee after he or she

establishes the claim. The Supreme Court rejected the contention

that the State Government or the authorized authority can hold an

inquiry into the merits and contentious issues regarding an

employee's claim while deciding the question of satisfaction under

<a href="/doc/678364/" id="a_36">Section 17</a> (1) of the Act. The Supreme Court observed:-

             provision is made in that behalf. If the
             legislature had intended that the enquiry
             authorized under <a href="/doc/678364/" id="a_37">Section 17</a> should include
             within its compass the examination of the
             merits of the employee's claim against his
             employer and a decision on it, the legislature
             would undoubtedly have made an appropriate
             provision conferring on the State Government
             or the specified authority the relevant powers
             essential for the purpose of effectively holding
             such an enquiry. The fact that the legislature
             has enacted <a href="/doc/31217/" id="a_38">Section 11</a> in regard to the Wage
             Board but has not made any corresponding
             provision in regard to the State Government or

             the specified authority under <a href="/doc/678364/" id="a_39">Section 17</a> lends
            strong corroboration to the view that the
            enquiry contemplated by <a href="/doc/678364/" id="a_40">Section 17</a> is a
            summary enquiry of a very limited nature and
            its scope is confined to the investigation of the
            narrow point as to what amount is actually due
            to be paid to the employee under the decree,
            award, or other valid order obtained by the
            employee after establishing his claim in that
            behalf. We are reluctant to accept the view
            that the legislature intended that the specified
            authority or the State Government should hold
            a larger enquiry into the merits of the
            employee's claim without conferring on the
            State Government or the specified authority
            the necessary powers in that behalf. In this
            connection, it would be relevant to point out
            that in many cases some complicated
            questions of fact may arise when working
            journalists make claims for wages against
            their employers. It is not unlikely that the
            status of the working journalist, the nature of
            the office he holds and the class to which he
            belongs may themselves be matters of
            dispute between the parties and the decision
            of such disputed questions of fact may need
            thorough examination and a formal enquiry. If
            that be so it is not likely that the legislature
            could have intended that such complicated
            questions of fact should be dealt with in a
            summary enquiry indicated by <a href="/doc/678364/" id="a_41">Section 17</a>.</blockquote><p id="p_25">

            the person entitled to the money under that

<p id="p_27">12.   Counsel for the respondent No.1 submitted that under <a href="/doc/1905977/" id="a_46">Section

17(1)</a> of the Act, the State Government or the authorized officer is

entitled to adjudicate disputed questions of law and, therefore, the

Deputy Labour Commissioner was entitled to interpret <a href="/doc/746513/" id="a_47">Section 5</a> of

the Act and hold that the respondent No.1 was entitled to and

compute quantum of gratuity. It was contended that when only

disputed questions of facts are involved, the matter is required to be

referred and adjudicated under <a href="/doc/678364/" id="a_48">Section 17</a> (2) of the Act. It is not

possible to agree with the said contention. <a href="/doc/1632564/" id="a_49">Section 17(2)</a> of the Act

will apply when disputed questions of facts, disputed questions of law

or when mixed disputed question of facts and law arise.           The

jurisdiction of the State Government or the authorized authority is

limited under <a href="/doc/1905977/" id="a_50">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act and confined to narrow

examination for satisfaction whether any amount can be recovered.

A detailed or elaborate inquiry into disputes and counter claims

whether they relate to law, facts or are mixed questions of law and

facts is not envisaged under <a href="/doc/1905977/" id="a_51">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act.

statement/reply before Deputy Labour Commissioner, authorized

officer appointed by the State Government under <a href="/doc/678364/" id="a_52">Section 17</a> (1) of

the Act. Disputes were raised regarding applicability of <a href="/doc/746513/" id="a_53">Section 5</a> and

 contentions raised was whether service rendered by the respondent

No.1 outside India before she was transferred to India vide letter

dated 27th August, 1999 can be taken into consideration and counted

for computing gratuity. These questions are debatable; require

adjudication and application of mind before they are decided one way

or the other. Possibly the respondent No.1 has a good case and after

due application of mind and reasoning, the State Government or the

authorized officer may feel that the claimant newspaper employee

would succeed, but this by itself would not confer jurisdiction on the

State Government or authorized officer to exercise power under

<a href="/doc/1632564/" id="a_55">Section 17(2)</a> of the Act. Lack of jurisdiction will make an order void

and lifeless, even when the decision is correct. A right decision

cannot confer jurisdiction, when under the statute the adjudicator has

no authority and power to decide. Adjudication is to be made by the

Labour Court and not by the State Government or the authorized

officer under <a href="/doc/1905977/" id="a_56">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act. Any adjudication or inquiry into

the merits and contentious issues can only be done under <a href="/doc/1632564/" id="a_57">Section

17(2)</a> of the Act and not under <a href="/doc/1905977/" id="a_58">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act. Any order

passed by the State Government or the authorized officer under

<a href="/doc/1905977/" id="a_59">Section 17(1)</a> of the act adjudicating the disputes and contentions

relating to merits and the amount due would be without jurisdiction. It

is clear from the order stated to be dated 4th May, 2008 that the

respondent No.2, Deputy Labour Commissioner has adjudicated the

disputes and contentions raised by the parties in the order. He has,

sustained.

<a href="/doc/678364/" id="a_60">Section 17</a> (2) of the Act. The State Government is at liberty to make
