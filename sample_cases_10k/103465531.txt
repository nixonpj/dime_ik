 PER COURT :-

 1.               In both these petitions, the challenge is to the order

 passed      by     the        learned   Additional   Divisional      Commissioner,

 Aurangabad on 21.11.2017 in Revision No.1992/ROR/IV/19.

 2.               The grievance raised by the petitioners in both these writ

 petitions is common that, while deciding the matter the subsequent

 developments which had occurred in respect of the suit properties

 were not brought to the notice of the learned Additional Divisional

 Commissioner. It is submitted that, during pendency of the aforesaid

 revision      application     before       the   Divisional    Commissioner,            a

 compromise was arrived at between the parties and a compromise

 decree was passed in Regular Civil Suit No.1027 of 1983. The suit

 was decreed in terms of the compromise on 23.06.1997. It is also

 pointed out that, the defendants in the said suit namely Subhash

 Sidram Yadav and Prabhavati Subhash Yadav, though filed another

 suit for cancellation of the consent decree, the said suit also came to

 be dismissed on 15.12.1999. The learned counsel appearing for the

 petitioners in both these writ petitions concurrently submitted that,

 had this fact been before the learned Additional Divisional

 Commissioner, perhaps the decision would have been different. The

 learned counsel, in the circumstances, have prayed for setting aside

 the impugned order and to remit the matter back to the learned

 Additional Divisional Commissioner to decide it on merits by

 allowing the parties to place on record the subsequent events and the

 documents in that regard.

 3.               Shri Thombre the learned counsel appearing for the

 respondent nos.1A to 1E in both these matters opposed the

 submissions made on behalf of the learned counsel appearing for the

 petitioners. His first objection is that, the petitions were not

 maintainable since the efficacious alternate remedy is available of

 filing second revision or appeal before the State Government and

 without availing the said remedy, the writ petition could not have

 been filed by the petitioners. The second objection of the learned

 counsel is that, the petitioners in Writ Petition No.9908 of 2018 were

 also party to the proceeding before the learned Additional Divisional

 Commissioner and as such, it was possible for them to bring the

 subsequent events to the notice of the learned Additional Divisional

 Commissioner.          In the circumstances, according to Shri Thombre,

 now it may not lie in the mouth of the petitioner in the present

 petition to say that, the subsequent events were not before the

 Additional Divisional Commissioner. The learned counsel further

 submitted that, subsequently in the year 1997, the partition had

 again taken place. The learned counsel tendered across the bar the

 photo copy of the said memorandum of partition.



 4.               After having considered the submissions as aforesaid, it

 appears to me that, the subsequent events which occurred in the

 meanwhile period during pendency of revision application before the

 learned Additional Divisional Commissioner must have been brought

 to his notice for the effective adjudication of the dispute raised in the

 said matter. From the documents, there is reason to believe that,

 Regular Civil Suit No.1027 of 1983 was settled and the decree was

 passed in terms of compromise therein.



 5.               The documents on record also reveal that, the suit filed

 for cancellation of the consent decree was also dismissed on

 15.12.1999. These facts were certainly necessary for adjudication of

 the dispute which was raised in the revision before the learned

 Additional Divisional Commissioner.



 6.               As has been submitted by Shri Sawant the learned

 counsel appearing for the petitioners in Writ Petition No.9388 of

 2018, the petitioners in the said writ petition were not party to the

 proceeding before the Additional Divisional Commissioner or in any

 previous proceeding. The petitioners in Writ Petition No.9388 of 2018

 are claiming certain rights in respect of the suit properties based on

 the transactions which they have entered into with Balasaheb

 Vaijanath Bhise. In the circumstances, without going into the merits

 of the contentions raised by the parties in the present petition, it

 appears to me that, to remit back the matter to the Additional

 Divisional Commissioner to decide it afresh by giving opportunity to

 all the parties to put forth their respective submissions would be in

 the interest of all the parties. In the circumstances, the following

 order is passed.

 matter by considering subsequent events and documents, which may

 be placed on record before it, as expeditiously as possible, preferably

 within the period of 12 weeks from the date of this order. Till then
