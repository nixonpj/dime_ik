          HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJ KUMAR GARG

                          Judgment / Order

27/08/2019

       Instant criminal appeal has been filed by the appellant under

Section 374(2) Cr.P.C. against the judgment dated 29.05.2012

passed by learned Special Judge, NDPS Cases, Hanumangarh in

Sessions Case No. 58/2005 by which the learned Judge convicted

the appellant for offence under Section 8/18C NDPS Act and

sentenced    to    undergo      four     years       R.I.        alongwith   fine   of

Rs.40,000/-, in default of payment of fine to undergo one year's

R.I.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       Brief facts of the case are that on 14.10.2005, Sh. Dharma

Poonia, SHO PS Rawatsar on a secret information at 3 PM reached

near Thalarka Nohar road and made nakabandi where a person

was coming, who seeing to the police party tried to turn, on doubt

he was apprehended and identified as accused Ashlam and he was

searched and recovered 1 KG opium tied around with his waist in




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                     (Downloaded on 28/08/2019 at 11:52:19 PM)</span>

a cloth. Two samples of 100-100 gms were taken and rest of

opium was sealed in other bag and accused was arrested.

</p><p id="p_5">     Thereafter the police registered a case against the accused-

appellant being FIR No.256/05 for offence under <a href="/doc/704277/" id="a_1">Sections 8</a>/<a href="/doc/325366/" id="a_2">18</a> of

NDPS    Act   and   started      investigation.          After   completion   of

investigation, the police filed challan against the present appellant

and another accused Subhash for offence under <a href="/doc/704277/" id="a_3">Sections 8</a>/<a href="/doc/325366/" id="a_4">18</a>, <a href="/doc/1252855/" id="a_5">29</a>

of NDPS Act. Thereafter, the charges were framed against the

appellant for offence under <a href="/doc/704277/" id="a_6">Section 8</a>/<a href="/doc/325366/" id="a_7">18</a> and against accused

Subhash for offence under <a href="/doc/704277/" id="a_8">Sections 8</a>/<a href="/doc/325366/" id="a_9">18</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1252855/" id="a_10">29</a> of NDPS Act and

other accused. They denied the charges and claimed trial.

</p><p id="p_6">     During the course of trial, the prosecution examined 14

witnesses and various documents were also exhibited. Thereafter,

statements of appellant and co-accused under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_11">section 313</a> Cr.P.C

were recorded. Three witnesses were examined on defence side.

</p><p id="p_7">     Upon conclusion of the trial, the learned trial court vide

impugned judgment dated 29.05.2012 acquitted the co-accused

Subhash for offence under <a href="/doc/704277/" id="a_12">Sections 8</a>/<a href="/doc/325366/" id="a_13">18</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1252855/" id="a_14">29</a> of NDPS Act but

convicted and sentenced the appellant for offence under <a href="/doc/704277/" id="a_15">Section

8</a>/<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_16">18C</a> NDPS Act as mentioned earlier.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     At the threshold, learned counsel for the appellant does not

challenge the finding of conviction but it is submitted that since

the occurrence relates back to year 2005 and in the present case

only 1 Kg opium was recovered from the appellant which is below

commercial quantity and further the appellant has so far suffered

a sentence of about four and half months out of total sentence of

four years, therefore, it is prayed that the substantive sentence

awarded to the appellant for the aforesaid offence may be reduced

to the period already undergone by him. In support of his

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                    (Downloaded on 28/08/2019 at 11:52:19 PM)</span>
                                       (3 of 4)



contention, learned counsel for the appellant relied upon judgment

of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/127596595/" id="a_17">Mohammad Ali v. State of Rajasthan</a>

reported in 2013(4) CJ(Cri.) (Raj.) 1914, <a href="/doc/179852100/" id="a_18">Niyamat Ali Nemu v.

State of Rajasthan</a> reported in 2013(4) CJ(Cri.) (Raj.) 1915, <a href="/doc/67193625/" id="a_19">Sher

Singh vs. State of Rajasthan</a> reported in 2016(1) WLN 156 (Raj.).

</p><p id="p_9">     On the other hand, the learned Public Prosecutor opposed

the submissions made by the learned counsel for the appellant.

The learned PP submitted that there is neither any occasion to

interfere with the sentence awarded to the accused appellant nor

any compassion or sympathy is called for in the said case.

</p><p id="p_10">     Since   the   appellant's      counsel        does         not   challenge   the

appellant's conviction, this Court need not go into the merits of

the case and accordingly, the conviction of the appellant as

recorded by the learned trial court for the offence under <a href="/doc/704277/" id="a_20">Section

8</a>/<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_21">18C</a> NDPS Act is maintained.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     I have perused the evidence of the prosecution as well as

defence and the judgment passed by the trial court regarding

conviction of the accused-appellant. It is not disputed that the

occurrence relates back to year 2005 and 1 Kg opium was

recovered from the appellant which is below commercial quantity

and the appellant has so far undergone a period of about four and

half months incarceration out of the total four years' rigorous

imprisonment so also suffered the agony and trauma of protracted

trial. Thus, looking to the over-all circumstances and the fact that

the appellant has remained behind the bars for considerable time,

it will be just and proper if the sentence awarded by the trial court

for offence under <a href="/doc/704277/" id="a_22">Section 8</a>/<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_23">18C</a> NDPS Act is reduced to the period

already undergone by him while maintaining the amount of fine in

the sum of Rs. 40,000/-.

                                        Accordingly, the appeal is partly allowed. While maintaining

                                   the appellant's conviction and sentence for offence under <a href="/doc/704277/" id="a_24">Section

                                   8</a>/<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_25">18C</a> NDPS Act, the sentence awarded to him is reduced to the

                                   period already undergone, however the amount of fine is hereby

                                   maintained.   In default of payment of fine, the appellant shall

                                   undergo one year's rigorous imprisonment. Two month's time is

                                   granted to deposit the fine before the trial court. Appellant is on

                                   bail. His bail bonds stand discharged.
