       The applicants have filed this first bail application under

<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_1">section 439</a> of the Cr.P.C. for grant of bail.

falsely been implicated in the matter and they are in custody

since 20/05/2019. It is submitted that charge sheet has been filed

and no further custodial interrogation is required in the matter.

Initially FIR was registered against the unknown persons and

after completing the investigation, police filed closure report

disclosing that no case is made out as per the allegation /

prosecution story. After four years, statement under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_4">Section 164</a>

of the Cr.P.C of the prosecutrix was recorded in which she has

changed entire statement and named the applicants and other co-

accused. On the basis of which , false case against the applicants

and co-accused has been registered. TIP was conducted after

recording statement under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_5">Section 164</a> of the Cr.P.C in which she

refused to recognize the applicants. Due to previous enemity and

the fact that order being passed under Section 250 of the

M.P.L.R.C, applicants as well as co-accused have falsely been

implicated in the offence. There is contradiction in the statement

under <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_6">Section 161</a> and <a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_7">164</a> of the Cr.P.C. It is further submitted
