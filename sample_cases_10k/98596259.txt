        PW: 3: Ct. Kunwar Pal Singh has testified that on  20.02.2007 while he was 

posted at PS Shahdara.  On that day, while on patrolling in Division no. 6, DDA 

Ground At about 10.30­10.40 am he saw one   boy, standing near the gate of 

DDA Ground and after seeing him in police uniform he became perplexed and 

tried to run away, upon suspicion, he had asked him to stop but when he tried 

to run away he   chased him and apprehended him after coming about 10­15 

paces.  After his apprehension, when he  made casual search of the said person 

who revealed his name upon inquiries to be Amit, one button actuated knife 

was recovered from the right dub of the pant of the accused.  In the meantime, 

SI Bhupender reached at the spot while on patrolling.  He had  produced the 

accused and the recovered knife to him who recorded his statement which is 

already   Ex.   PW2/A   .   At   that   time,   he   also   tried   to   join   4/5   public   persons,

Total length of the knife was 24 cms, length of the blade was 11 cms, length of 

the handle was 13 cms and the width of the blade was 2.5 cm. There was a

<p id="p_14">         I   have   heard   learned   APP   for   the   State   and   learned   counsel   for   the 

accused.
</p>
<p id="p_15">       It is a settled proposition of criminal law that prosecution is supposed to 

prove its case on judicial file beyond reasonable doubts by leading reliable, 

cogent and convincing evidence. Further it is a settled proposition of criminal 

law that in order to prove its case on judicial file, prosecution is supposed to 

stand   on   its   on   legs   and   it   cannot   derive   any   benefit   whatsoever   from   the 

weaknesses,   if   any,   in   the   defence   of   the   accused.   Further   it   is   a   settled 

proposition   of   criminal   law   that   burden   of   proof   of   the   version   of   the 

prosecution in a criminal trial throughout the trial is on the prosecution and it 

never shits to the accused. Also it is a settled proposition of criminal law that 

accused is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt in the prosecution 

story and such doubt entitles the accused to acquittal. Keeping in view above 

stated   well   established   legal   proposition,   it   would   be   approriate   to   refer 

Chapter 22 Rule 49 of Punjab Police Rules, 1934, which provides as under:


</p><p id="p_16">            ''22.49 Matters to be entered in Register No. II - The following 
       matters shall, amongst others, be entered :­

</p><p id="p_17">   (c) The hour of arrival and departure on duty at or from a police station of all  
   enrolled police officers of whatever rank, whether posted at the police station  
   or elsewhere, with a statement of the nature of their duty. This entry shall be  


FIR NO. 71/07                                                                     Page 6of 12pages
   made   immediately   on   arrival   or   prior   to   the   departure   of   the   officer  
  concerned and shall be attested by the latter personally by signature or seal.

     Note :­ The term Police Station will include all places such as Police Lines  
     and Police Posts where Register No. II is maintained.
</p><p id="p_18">1.In   the   present   case,   the   above   said   provision   appears   to   have   not   been 

complied with by prosecution. As per the prosecution version at the time of the 

apprehension of the accused with one button operated knife in his possession, 

police officials were on vehicle checking duty   but the DD entry vide which 

they had left the PS for vehicle checking has not been brought on record. Even 

the number of the said DD entry made in Register No. II has not been brought 

on judicial record. In my opinion prosecution was under an obligation to prove 

on record, the above said DD entry vide which above said police officials had 

left the PS for vehicle checking duty so as to prove the possibility of availability 

of Police witnesses at the place of apprehension of the accused. In the facts 

and circumstances of the case, the prosecution ought to have proved the DD 

entry by which the above said police officials had left the PS so as to inspire the 

confidence regarding their availability/presence at the place of apprehension 

of  the  accused.  At this  juncture, it would  be  relevant  to  refer to  a  case law 

reported as  Rattan Lal V/s State, 1987 (2) Crimes 29  the Hon'ble Delhi High 

Court wherein it has been observed that if the investigating agency deliberately 

ignores   to   comply   with   the   provisions   of   the   Act   the   courts   will   have   to 


FIR NO. 71/07                                                                    Page 7of 12pages
 approach   their   action   with   reservations.  The   matter   has   to   be   viewed   with 

suspicion if the provisions of law are not strictly complied with and the least 

that can be said is that it is so done with an oblique motive. This failure to 

bring on record, the DD entry creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution 

version and attributes oblique motive on the part of the prosecution.

</p><p id="p_19">2.   As   per   prosecution   version   came   on   record,   after   apprehension   of   the 

accused IO requested 4­5 passersby to join the police raiding party but all left 

the   spot   after   giving   reasonable   excuses,   however   without   disclosing   their 

name and address. As per rukka after apprehension of the accused with button 

actuated   knife   in   his   possession,   since   attempt   has   not   been   made   by   the 

police to join independent public persons in the police proceedings despite 

availability of such witnesses. After the apprehension of the accused, IO of the 

case could very well have served the passersby/public witnesses with notice in 

writing   to   join   the   police   proceedings   inasmuch   as   at   that   point   of   time 

accused already stood apprehended and there was no possibility of accused 

escaping   his   arrest   or   crime   going   undetected.   At   least   in   the   facts   and 

circumstances   of   the   case   in   my   opinion   IO   must   have   asked   the 

passersby/persons available at the spot by serving them notice in writing and 

in case of their refusal IO must have taken action against them U/s 187 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>. 

Facts and circumstance of the case suggest that no sincere efforts have been 



FIR NO. 71/07                                                                  Page 8of 12pages
 made   by   police   official   to   join   independent   public   witnesses   in   the   police 

proceedings. In this regard in   Anoop Joshi V/s State, 1992 (2) C.C.Cases 314 

(HC), Hon'ble High Court of Delhi has observed as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     ''18. It is repeatedly laid down by this Court that in such cases it should  
     be   shown   by   the   police   that   sincere   efforts   have   been   made   to   join  
     independent witnesses. In the present case, it is evident that no such  
     sincere efforts have been made, particularly when we find that shops 
     were open and one or two shop­keepers could have been persuaded to  
     join   the   raiding   party   to   witness   the   recovery   being   made   from   the  
     appellant.  In   case   any   of   the   shopkeepers   had   declined   to   join   the  
     raiding party, the police could have later on taken legal action against  
     such shopkeepers because they could not have escaped the rigours of 
     law while declining to perform their legal duty to assist the police in 
     investigation as a citizen, which is an offence under the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a>''.</blockquote><p id="p_20">

FIR NO. 71/07                                                                      Page 9of 12pages
        result into enmity between them and the petitioner''. ''4. It is well  
       settled principle of the law that the Investigating Agency should join  
       independent witnesses at the time of recovery of contraband articles, 
       if they are available and their failure to do so in such a situation  
       casts a shadow of doubt on the prosecution case. In the present case  
       also   admittedly   the   independent   witnesses   were   available   at   the  
       time   of   recovery   but   they   refused   to   associate   themselves   in   the 
       investigation. This explanation does not inspire confidence because  
       the police officials who are the only witnesses examined in the case  
       have not given the names and addresses of the persons contacted to  
       join It is a very common excuse that the witnesses from the public  
       refused   to   join   the   investigation.   A   police   officer   conducting 
       investigation   of   a   crime   is   entitled   to   ask   anybody   to   join   the  
       investigation   and   on   refusal   by   a   person   from   the   public   the 
       Investigating Officer can take action against such a person under  
       the law. Had it been a fact that he witnesses from the public had 
       refused to to join the investigation, the Investigating Officer must  
       have proceeded against them under the relevant provisions of law.  
       The failure to do so by the police officer is suggestive of the fact that  
       the explanation for non­joining the witnesses from the public is an  
       after thought  and is not  worthy  of credence. All  these facts taken  
       together make the prosecution case highly doubtful''.
         In case law reported as Sadhu Singh V/s State of Punjab, 1997 (3) Crimes 

  55 the Hon'ble Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court observed as under:­


       ''5. In a criminal trial, it is for the prosecution to establish its case  
       beyond all reasonable doubts. It is for the prosecution to travel the  

FIR NO. 71/07                                                                   Page 10of 12pages
         entire   distance   from   may   have   to   must   have.  If   the   prosecution  
        appears to be improbable or lacks credibility the benefit of doubt  
        necessarily has to go to the accused'' ''6. In the present case, the State 
        examined two witnesses namely, Harbans Singh ASI who appeared  
        as PW1 and Kartar Singh. PW2. Both the witnesses supported the  
        prosecution   version   in   terms   of   the   recovery   of   opium   from   the  
        person of the petitioner, but there was no public witness who had 
        joined. It is not necessary in such recoveries that public witnesses  
        must   be   joined,   but   attempt   must   be   made   to   join   the   public  
        witnesses. There can be cases when public witnesses are reluctant to 
        join or are not available. All the same, the prosecution must show a  
        genuine attempt having been made to join a public witness or that  
        they were not available. A stereo­type statement of non­availability  
        will not be sufficient particularly when at the relevant time, it was  
        not   difficult  to  procure  the  service  of  public  witness.  This  reflects  
        adversely on the prosecution version''.

      Being guided by above said case law, it can be said that search of the 

accused by above said police official(s) was in complete violation of the above 

said case law and the same can be said to be illegal. As per evidence on record, 

the   seal   after   use   on   the   pulanda   containing   the   case   property   allegedly 

recovered from the accused was given to none else but to one who is a material 

prosecution witness being a witnesses to the alleged recovery of the illicit knife 

from the possession of the accused. Such material witness of a case is always

 interested in the success of the case of the prosecution and keeping in view of 

this factum chances of fabrication of case property cannot be ruled out beyond 

doubts. Further it is equally  pertinent to  note that the entire judicial file is 

silent as to when the seal was given back said witness to IO. 

</p><p id="p_24">      In the present case, the above mentioned doubts circumstances are very 

much   evident.     It   has   come   in   evidence   of   PW3   and   PW4   that   despite 

availability they did not join any independent witness. Moreover, whole search 

proceedings   conducted by doubtful circumstance. Therefore in view of the 

above discussion, I find that benefit of doubt is to be given to the accused as a 

consequence   thereof   accused   stands   acquitted.   His     PB/SB   stand   cancelled 

and   discharged.  File   be   consigned   to   record   room  after   completion   of 

necessary formalities.
