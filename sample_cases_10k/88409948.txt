         IN THE HIGH COURT OF JHARKHAND AT RANCHI
                      Cont. Case (Civil) No. 837 of 2013
                              ............

04/20.11.2013</pre><p id="p_1">          Alleging disobedience of order dated 08.03.2013 passed

            in W.P. (S) No. 612 of 2003, the present Contempt case has been

            filed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">            2.         In paragraph nos. 5-7, the applicant has stated as under :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                       5.    "That however, inspite of lapse of more
                       than six months, the opposite party no. 2 has not
                       complied with the order dated 08.03.2013
                       passed in W.P. (S) no. 612 of 2003 by this
                       Hon'ble High Court and the petitioner has not
                       been supplied with any document nor has been
                       given an opportunity of hearing to him or his
                       authorized representative.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                       6.    That moreover, though this Hon'ble High
                       Court has been pleased to quash the order dated
                       14.12.2002 and the consequent order dated
                       22.12.2002 by its order dated 08.03.2013 but he
                       is not being paid any amount towards his
                       pension.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                       7.    That in view of the order dated 08.03.2013
                       the date of contempt starts from 08.09.2013.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2</span>



<p id="p_3">3.            The learned counsel appearing for the applicant has

stated that a copy of the order dated 08.03.2013 was sent by the

petitioner through speed post on 26.03.2013 and a proof of the same

has been attached along with the contempt petition. The learned

counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the direction of this

Court was to pass fresh order after supplying copies of the

documents and affording opportunity of hearing to the applicant,

within six months and since, this has not been done by the

contemnor no. 1, the contemnor is liable to be proceeded against by

this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.            On a perusal of the contempt petition, I find that in

paragraph no. 5 the applicant made a statement that since he has not

been supplied with the documents and no opportunity of hearing has

been granted to him within the time fixed by this Court, the

contemnor has disobeyed the order passed by this Court on

08.03.2013. I am of the opinion that the applicant has not been able

to make out a case even for issuing a show-cause to the contemnor

no. 1. Merely because the order passed by this Court has been sent

by speed post on 26.03.2013, a presumption cannot be drawn that

the said order has been received by the contemnor no.1 and even if it

is accepted that the said communication was received by the alleged

contemnor, a presumption cannot be drawn that the contemnor has

disobeyed the order passed by this Court.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 3</span><p id="p_5">




</p><p id="p_6">5.          The contempt proceeding being quasi-criminal in nature,

the same standard of proof is required in the same manner as in other

criminal cases. There should be a clear case of intentional

obstruction of administration of justice by the alleged contemnor.

There must be clear and reliable evidence to substantiate the

allegation against the alleged contemnor.

</p><p id="p_7">6.          <a href="/doc/654554/" id="a_1">Section 2(b)</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 defines

"Civil Contempt" as under :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">            "<a href="/doc/654554/" id="a_2">Section 2(b)</a> "civil contempt" means wilful
            disobedience to any judgment, decree,
            direction, order, writ or other process of a
            court or wilful breach of an undertaking given
            to a Court;"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">7.          The word 'willful' occurs in <a href="/doc/1737746/" id="a_3">Section 2</a> (b) of the Act and

thus, it is clear that the disobedience must be willful. It has been held

by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that even if breach of an order is

admitted by the alleged contemnor, it would not be sufficient to

initiate a proceeding under the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_4">Contempt of Courts Act</a>, 1971. <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_5">The

Act</a> provides for a punishment of imprisonment and thus, it is clear

that any proceeding under the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_6">Contempt of Courts Act</a> follows

serious consequences. I am of the view that before a proceeding

under the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_7">Contempt of Courts Act</a> is initiated, the applicant is

required to allege and prove by cogent evidence that the alleged

contemnor has disobeyed the order passed by the Court willfully and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                 4</span>

intentionally.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.          In "Sahdeo alias <a href="/doc/1769401/" id="a_8">Sahdeo Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh

&amp; others</a>", reported in (2010) 3 SCC 705 :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">            15. The proceedings of contempt are quasi-
            criminal in nature. In a case where the order
            passed by the court is not complied with by
            mistake, inadvertence or by misunderstanding
            of the meaning and purport of the order, unless
            it is intentional, no charge of contempt can be
            brought home. There may possibly be a case
            where disobedience is accidental. If that is so,
            there would be no contempt. [<a href="/doc/76696826/" id="a_9">Vide B.K. Kar v.
            Chief Justice and Justices of the Orissa High</a>
            Court (AIR p. 1370, para 7).]
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">            16. Similarly, in <a href="/doc/1575237/" id="a_10">Debabrata Bandopadhyay v.
            State of W.B</a>. this Court has observed as
            under: (AIR p. 193, para 9)
                "9. A question whether there is contempt of
                court or not is a serious one. The court is
                both the accuser as well as the judge of the
                accusation. It behoves the court to act with
                as great circumspection as possible making
                all allowances for errors of judgment and
                difficulties arising from inveterate practices
                in courts and tribunals. It is only when a
                clear case of contumacious conduct not
                explainable otherwise, arises that the
                contemnor must be punished. ...
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                Punishment under the law of contempt is
                called for when the lapse is deliberate and
                in disregard of one's duty and in defiance of
                authority. To take action in an unclear case
                is to make the law of contempt do duty for
                other measures and is not to be
                encouraged."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                                         (emphasis supplied)
                The same view has been reiterated by this
            Court in <a href="/doc/1179590/" id="a_11">Aligarh Municipal Board v. Ekka
            Tonga Mazdoor Union, Capt</a>. <a href="/doc/370752/" id="a_12">Dushyant Somal

</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">9.         <a href="/doc/1354422/" id="a_14">In "Manish Gupta and Others v. Gurudas Roy</a>", reported

in (1995) 3 SCC 559 :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">           15. "If the pay as refixed was Rs 600 which
           was also the pay drawn by the respondent in
           May 1989, it is difficult to appreciate how it
           can be said that the basic pay of the respondent
           was reduced as a result of such refixation. The
           said refixation was done on the basis of the
           officiating promotion of the respondent as
           Upper Division Assistant and not on the basis
           of the order passed by the Appellate Bench on
           20-9-1989. Moreover, in the order dated
           22-1-1990 it was expressly mentioned:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                 "This is a provisional fixation of his pay
              and final fixation will be made as per
              refixation of the seniority in the U.D. cases
              by common cadre wing."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">           16. The pay of the respondent was, thereafter,
           refixed in the light of the orders dated
           24-7-1990 and 23-10-1990 revising date of his
           promotion as Upper Division Assistant and his
           seniority in the cadre of Upper Division
           Assistant on that basis. In these circumstances,
           it cannot be said that the order dated
           22-1-1990 reflects an intention on the part of
           the appellants to wilfully or deliberately
           disobey the directions given by the Appellate
           Bench in the order dated 20-9-1989."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">10.        In the present case I find that except a bald statement that

a copy of the order passed by this Court was sent by speed post, no

material has been produced by the applicant that the alleged

                   08.03.2013 passed in W.P. (S) 612 of 2003. I further find that in the

                   petition the applicant has not even averred that the order passed by

                   this Court has been disobeyed by the alleged contemnor, willfully
