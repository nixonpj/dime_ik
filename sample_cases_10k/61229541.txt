<div class="doc_title">Wpms No. 927 Of 2014 vs Learned Counsel For The on 28 April, 2014</div><pre id="pre_1">WPMS No. 927 of 2014
Hon'ble Alok Singh, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">      Mr. Rajendra Dobhal, Senior
Advocate assisted by Mr. Manoj Sah,,
Advocate for the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_2">      Learned        counsel       for      the
tenant/petitioner vehemently argued that
the then landlord Shri Dhyan Singh Rawat
in his life time gave property, in question,
to her daughter Swarnlata Rawat,
respondent No.2 herein and name of
Swarnlata Rawat was mutated in the
municipal record after no objections were
submitted by the other legal heirs of Shri
Dhyan Singh Rawat. Further contends that
Smt. Swarnlata Rawat sold part of the
property in favour of Johri Dutt Chaudhary
claiming herself to be sole owner and
landlord of the property in question.
Further contends thereafter to get the
property vacated from the tenant/petitioner,
case was set up by Shanti Bisht that in the
family settlement between Swarnlata Rawat
and Shanti Bisht, property was given in the
share of Shanti Bisht and Shanti Bisht
requires property in question for the bona
fide need of her son.
</p><p id="p_3">      Learned counsel for the petitioner in
view of the above contends that if gift was
give to Swarnlata Rawat of the property in
question and she became sole owner of the
property in question, there was no occasion
to transfer property in question in family
settlement in favour of Smt. Shanti Bisht.
Consequently, alleged family settlement, on
the face of it is bogus, fictitious and illegal
 which was created to get property vacated.
Further contends that Shanti Bisht never
issued any notice claiming the rent rather
rent was being continuously paid to
Swarnlata Rawat. Thus, Shanti Bisht never
became landlord of the property in question
and application under Section 21 of the Act
can only be moved by the landlord.
</p><p id="p_4">       Issue notice to the respondents by
registered post A.D. in addition to normal
mode of service returnable within three
weeks on steps being taken by the
petitioners within one week.
</p><p id="p_5">       In the peculiar facts and circumstance
of the case, I direct that operation and
effect of the impugned judgment shall
remain stayed till further orders of this
Court.
</p><p id="p_6">       CLMA No. 4015 of 2014 stands
disposed of accordingly.
