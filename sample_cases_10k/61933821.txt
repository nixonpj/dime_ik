</pre>
<p id="p_1">		This petition has been filed seeking for a direction to the respondent police to execute the warrant dated 24.3.2014, issued by the III Fast Track Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, in C.C.No.11170/2009, in order to secure the convicted accused.
</p><p id="p_2">		2.The petitioner/complainant filed an appeal before this Court in Criminal Appeal No.113/2013 as against the order of acquittal dated 27.11.2012, in C.C.No.11170/2009, passed by the trial Magistrate.  The appeal against acquittal was allowed by judgment dated 10.1.2014, and thereafter, the accused A.M.Imthiaz Naser was questioned on 3.2.2014, regarding the quantum of sentence.  Further, it is stated by the petitioner that this Court imposed a fine of Rs.4,05,000/-, which was granted as compensation to the petitioner, and in default, the accused was sentenced to undergo one month Simple Imprisonment.  In spite of such a direction/condition, the accused did not comply with the same and therefore, the trial Magistrate issued a warrant of arrest on 24.3.2014.  It appears that though the order was received by the respondent police, till date, the same has not been executed.  
</p>
<p id="p_3">		3.When the matter came up for admission on 29.4.2014, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor took notice.  Thereafter, the matter was once again listed on 5.6.2014, and one more set of papers was directed to be served on the learned Additional Public Prosecutor.
</p>
<p id="p_4">		4.Today, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that necessary direction may be issued for the purpose of executing the warrant.
</p>
<p id="p_5">		5.In the light of the above, there shall be a direction to the respondent police to comply with the direction issued by the trial Magistrate, who has issued the warrant of arrest on 24.3.2014, within a period of three weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order.  This Criminal original petition is, accordingly, disposed of.
