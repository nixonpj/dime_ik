basic provisions of law; that the Ld. Trial court has committed serious
error of facts while holding that the complainant (revisionist herein) is also
residing at Ghaziabad U.P i.e out of Delhi and no offence even part of the

herein) has categorically stated in her complaint and statements before
the police that she is residing at 1/352, Sri Ram Nagar, Shahdara, Delhi;

complainant that the Roka and Sagai ceremonies were solemnised in
Delhi and after the marriage of the revisionist, the family of the revisionist
shifted to Ghaziabad, U.P and respondent No. 1 was/is residing at F-246-
B, Upper Ground Floor, Laxmi Nagar, Delhi; that the Ld. Magistrate has
committed serious error of law and facts while discharging the accused
husband on the ground that she has no jurisdiction to try the present case;
that even if the jurisdiction of the case was not made out at Delhi, the
Ld. Trial Court should have directed the police report to be returned to the
investigating agency to present it in the appropriate court. On behalf of the
revisionists reliance has been placed on authorities reported as Puneet
Chawla v State, Crl. M.C. No. 2534/2011 dated 26th February 2013, Y.
Abrahim Ajith &amp; Others v Inspector of Police Chennai &amp; Ors 2004(3)

 residing at House No. 1/352, Sri Ram Nagar, Shahdara, Delhi. The SHO

custody. The respondents No. 2 and 3 had applied for anticipatory bail
which were granted on 28/04/12. The respondent No. 1 was summoned
by Ld. MM for trial but at the stage of consideration of charge vide
impugned order the respondent No. 1 was discharged holding that she
has no jurisdiction in the matter. It has been submitted that the
revisionist/complainant was residing at Shahdara within the territorial

neither     charge-sheeted     them   nor   filed   any   closure   report   and
Ld. Magistrate ought to have directed the police to re-investigate the
matter and police should have collected the evidence of marriage and the
residence of both husband and wife to enable the Ld. Metropolitan
Magistrate to form a definite view about jurisdiction. Findings of Ld. Trial
court are contrary to the authority Puneet Chawla v State (Supra). The
accused persons were granted bail by Delhi Court and thereafter, the

complainant (revisionist herein) addressed to the Commissioner of Police,
Delhi, shows that the marriage between the parties was solemnised on
19/06/05 as per Hindu rites and customs at Vaishali, Ghaziabad, U.P.
A female child was born out of the wedlock at St. Stephen Hospital, Delhi.
According to the complainant, her parents had incurred expenses to the
tune of Rs. 32 lacs including jewellery, cash and other material which are
in the custody of parents of the accused. She has alleged that the
accused persons started compelling the complainant and her parents to
give more dowry since the date of marriage and started quarreling with
the complainant to bring more dowry/cash to purchase a new house and
fulfill other requirements of the family of accused. They all jointly and
collectively threatened her to leave the matrimonial house if the
complainant failed to bring dowry for the said requirement. Her parents
gave Rs. two lac to the parents of her husband. They had again started
quarreling to bring more dowry and started beating her. On birth of female
child the accused persons started torturing the complainant. Meanwhile,
husband of the complainant pressurised the parents of the complainant to
arrange money to send him to Australia for advance Diploma in Hospitality
Management assuring that he will return the money and that he would live


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">Crl. Rev. Nos. 58/13 &amp; 50/13                                        Page 5 of 10</span>
 with the complainant separately and independently. The father of the
complainant sold out his house to fulfill the demand of the accused and
paid Rs. five lacs in cash and also deposited Rs. 14 lacs in Syndicate
Bank, Indirapuram, Ghaziabad, U.P as surety for the said course. The
accused sent some documents in November 2009 for making the
passport of the complainant for her visit to Australia alongwith the
daughter. Accordingly, she applied and obtained passport on 04/01/10 and
thereafter the accused started ignoring the complainant and told that he
had married her only to extort money to settle in foreign country and now
he is no more interested in the complainant. The complainant came to
know that the accused persons had sold their house No. 10/05 (1st Floor),
Gulmohar Road, Shipra Suncity, Ghaziabad, U.P and were temporarily
living with their daughter and son-in-law and were trying to leave India.
After registration of case U/s 498A/406/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a> and U/s 4 of D.P. Act,
permission to arrest the accused Vivek Sharma was sought and lookout
circular was got issued. The parents of the accused Vivek Sharma were
granted anticipatory bail vide order dated 28/04/12 by Ld. ASJ/Fast Track
Court/NE District, Karkardooma Courts, Delhi and Ld. Metropolitan
Magistrate vide order dated 30/05/12 granted regular bail subject to
certain conditions. Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate had also released the
passport of the accused. The accused had made statement on 03/05/12
before Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate giving undertaking that he will take
steps for doing the formalities so that he can take the complainant and the
daughter to Australia perhaps which was one of the considerations for
granting bail to him.

<p id="p_7">7.               During the pendency of anticipatory bail application of father
of the accused, the matter was also referred to Ld. Incharge Mediation
Centre where the parties also arrived at settlement subject to conditions

was ever taken about the territorial jurisdiction of Delhi Court on behalf of
the accused persons, in above mentioned proceedings/orders.

Delhi stating as to why she has not given birth to a male child. In her
presence, the accused had demanded Rs. five lacs from father of the
complainant. When the complainant refused, her husband (respondent
No. 1) slapped the complainant on 20/12/05. The family members of the
accused started taunting for dowry and at that time accused Vivek was in
service in a restaurant at Delhi. In order to facilitate the studies of
husband of the complainant at Australia the complainant had also paid
Rs. 14 lacs. These allegations have also been made by Smt. Manju
Gupta, Sh. Subhash Gupta and Sh. Pradeep Kumar Aggarwal in the
statements U/s 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_9">Cr.PC</a> recorded by the IO.

 jurisdiction on both the areas have got territorial jurisdiction to take
cognizance of offence as held in the authority reported as "Pradipta Basu
Roy Chowdhury Vs. Babita Basu Chowdhury, (1997) 2 Crimes 397
(Cal)".

<p id="p_11">11.              The offence of criminal breach of trust U/s 406 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_14">IPC</a> is a
continuing offence and the complainant's dowry articles have not been
delivered to her. The complainant has alleged that R-1 has gone for
studies in Australia. The R-2 and R-3 have sold their house and were
presently residing at F-246 A, Mangal Bazar, Laxmi Nagar, Delhi, which
falls within the jurisdiction of Delhi courts. The complainant has reiterated
her demands during the proceedings before CAW Cell and her dowry
articles/jewellery have not been delivered to her and therefore, Delhi
Court has jurisdiction in the matter.

<p id="p_12">12.              From the above, it is apparent from the record that part
cause of action as discussed above also arose within the territorial
jurisdiction of Delhi Courts and therefore, Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate was
competent to exercise territorial jurisdiction. In my considered view
Ld. Trial Court fell in error in holding that she does not have jurisdiction
over the present matter. The revisions preferred by the State as well as
revisionist (complainant) deserve to be allowed and are accordingly
allowed. The impugned order is set aside and the matter is remanded
back to Ld. Trial Court to hear the parties afresh for consideration of
charge against the accused persons and to pass the orders on charge as
per law. The parties are directed to appear before Ld. Trial court on
27/09/13 at 11:00 a.m. The copy of order be kept on both the revision
files. A copy of order alongwith trial court record be sent to the Ld. Trial
court for information and compliance and revision files be consigned to
