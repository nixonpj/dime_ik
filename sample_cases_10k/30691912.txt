                      The   Electricity   Board   sponsored   the   candidates   by   giving

                      preference to the persons, who had undergone apprenticeship

                      training with the Board. However the selection which is under

                      challenge was concluded, on the basis of an open competitive

                      process and no preference was given for the apprenticeship

                      candidates. Thus, the writ petitioners are constrained to move the

                      apprenticeships are provided preference by various Government

                      Organizations as well as by the Private Companies, based on the

                      provisions of the <a href="/doc/96384590/" id="a_4">Apprenticeship Act</a>. The very purpose and object

                      training       would     not    confer      any      right   to   secure     or     claim

                      mere providing of the trainings would not be a ground to claim

                      constitution is violated.

                      mandate. Only in the event of conducting an open competitive

                      process,   equal   opportunity   can   be   provided.   Apprenticeship

                      trainings are provided based on the registration of candidates, may

                      Thus, the open competitive process must be the method of

                      recruitment, which is now being followed by the TamilNadu

                      Electricity Board for all appointments. Under these circumstances,

                      the grounds raised by the writ petitioners that they should be given

                      preference as they have completed apprenticeship training in the

                      Board cannot be accepted, all the qualified persons must be

                      provided with an opportunity to participate in the open competitive

                      process and the writ petitioners are also entitled to participate in

                      the said process along with all other qualified candidates. In the

                      present case, the writ petitioners had participated, however, not

                      selected. Having accepted the terms and conditions of the

                      notifications and after participating in the process of selection, the

                      condition stipulated in the notification cannot be challenged. The

                      Supreme Court also held in many judgements that the candidates,

                      who accepted the terms and conditions and participated in the

                      process of selection and thereafter they cannot challenge those

                      condition and such writ petitions cannot be entertained at all. They

                      cannot approbate and reprobate. This being the principles to be

                      adopted, now, the writ petitioners cannot challenge the selection

                      list after participation in the process of selection, even otherwise

                      also, mere completion of apprenticeship training would not confer

                      any right on the writ petitioners to claim appointment. This being

                      the principles to be followed, there is no infirmity in respect of the

                      procedure followed for selection to the post of Technical Assistant

                      (EEE) in the TamilNadu Electricity Board. The writ petitioners have

                      not established any acceptable legal grounds for the purpose of

                      considering their relief as such sought for in the present       writ
