behalf of respondents u/s.25-B (4) of DRC Act for grant permission for
leave contest the petition.

</p><p id="p_4"> 2.           Brief facts which are relevant for the disposal of application
in hands are that petitioners have filed the present eviction petition under
section 14(1) (e) r/w. Sec. 25B of the Delhi Rent Control Act against the
respondents on the averments that petitioners are the owners/landlords in
respect of property no. 2648, Mohalla Niarian, Behind G.B. Road, Delhi.
The said property was purchased by the petitioner no.1 as well as by
Husan Ara Begum from previous owner Zamarud Begum vide registered
sale deed dated 13.08.1993. Mst.Husan Ara Begum died leaving behind
the petitioners no.2 to 9 as her legal heirs and thus petitioners are the
owners/landlords the property in question.        After purchased of the
property, the petitioners mutated the property in their names as owners.
</p><p id="p_5">             It is further stated that Mst.Rabia was original tenant and
after her death, the respondents as her sons who became the tenant by
operation of law and they alone are in possession of tenanted premises
i.e. one room dalan in the ground floor but the they have converted the
open area in the ground floor by converting the same as tin shed and
besides this, one tin shed is raised in the first floor as shown in red and
yellow colours in the site plan.
</p><p id="p_6">             It is further stated that petitioners are using for residence
portions of property no.2648 which is shown green and blue colour.
</p><p id="p_7">             It is further averred that the petitioner no.1 besides his wife
has five daughters and one son and out of five daughters, two daughters
are married but they regularly visiting the petitioner no.1. The son of
petitioner no.1 is employed and is of marriageable age and his three
daughters are also major. The petitioner no.1 have only three rooms,
kitchen which are highly insufficient for three grown up daughters and one
grown up son. Considering the status of petitioner no.1 and his family,
they require the tenancy portion for their residence and for residence of
petitioner no.1's family.
</p><p id="p_8">             It is further stated that besides the property no.2648, the

E­134/2010                                                                2/9
 petitioners own property no.5357, Kucha Rehman, Chandni Chowk, Delhi
but the same is being used for carrying on business by the petitioners
and therefore, it is not suitable for residence and same is approx. 3 kms.
away from property no.2648.
</p>

<p id="p_9">3.           In the leave to defend application supported by affidavit, the
respondents have raised the following objections that:-
</p><p id="p_10">(a)          There exists no relationship of owner/landlord and tenants
between the petitioners and respondents as petitioners are the legal heirs
of Sh.Abdul Gaffar who was also inducted as tenant in respect of portion
shown in blue and green colour of the property bearing no.2648 in the
year 1948 and till date they are in possession of same in the capacity of
tenant and the actual owner of the premises in question was Mohd.
Wahiduddin.
</p><p id="p_11">(b)              The petitioners have concealed the factum of the civil
litigation pending between the petitioners and the legal heirs of Mohd.
Wahiduddin wherein legal heirs of Mohd. Wahiduddin have claimed
themselves to be the owner of the suit property.
</p><p id="p_12">(c)          The petitioners have enough and sufficient accommodation/
space in their hand and the petitioners have no bonafide requirement in
respect of the premises in question and they have sufficient
accommodation in property no.5357. It is also contended that the
petitioner no.1 has three rooms in his possession on the ground floor and
one room on the first floor.
</p><p id="p_13">(d)          The respondents have no other place for the purpose of their
residence and they are residing the premises in question with respective
families (20 persons in number) in the portion yellow and red shown in
the site plan.
</p><p id="p_14">(e)          The petitioners even own a property in Wazirabad, Delhi.
</p><p id="p_15">             In view of above grounds, it is submitted that petitioners
have no bonafide requirement of the tenanted premises and hence, it has

E­134/2010                                                               3/9
 been prayed that respondents be granted leave to contest the present
petition.
</p>

<p id="p_16">4.           In the counter affidavit, the petitioners have denied all the
contentions raised by the respondents and reiterated the averments
made in the petition and also submitted that the respondents have not
disclosed any triable issues which will entitle them for leave to appear
and contest the eviction petition. Hence, it is prayed that leave to defend
application be dismissed and eviction order be passed.
</p>

<p id="p_17">5.           Arguments on petition has already been heard.
</p>

<p id="p_18">6.           I have carefully perused the entire material available on
record and my findings with respect to the objections raised by the
respondent as follows:-
</p>

<p id="p_19">7.           The first objection of the respondents is that there exists no
relationship of owner/landlord and tenants between the petitioners and
respondents as petitioners are in possession of same in the capacity of
tenant and the actual owner of the premises in question was Mohd.
Wahiduddin.
</p><p id="p_20">             The petitioners admitted that they were tenants in the
property in question but submitted that vide sale deed dated 13.08.1993,
they had purchased the entire property in question from its erstwhile
owner Smt.Zamarud Begum. The respondents contended that said sale
deed is a sham document as they have tendered regularly without default
the rent earlier to Mohd.Wahiduddin and thereafter, the rent was tendered
through Ms.Zamarud Begum as per the direction of Mohd.Wahiduddin
and their death, the rent till date has been been tendered to Naseer-ul-
naq.    The respondents have placed on record certain rent receipts in
Urdu with their translated copies in English language. The said rent

E­134/2010                                                               4/9
 receipts pertaining to the period from 1946 to 1978. The last rent receipt
of the year 1978 which the respondents have placed on record clearly
shows that they lastly tendered the rent to Smt.Zamarud Begum. The
petitioners have purchased the property in the year 1993 from said Smt.
Zamarud Begum.       No rent receipt or any other document has been
placed on record by respondents which shows that they have tendered
the rent to alleged Naseer-ul-naq after 1993 when petitioners have
purchased the property in question. I also feel that after execution of sale
deed 13.08.1993 in favour of the petitioners, the petitioners have became
the title holder of the tenanted premises to file the petition U/s. 14(1) (e)
of DRC Act. It has been held by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in
Rajender Kumar Sharma &amp; Ors. Vs. Leela Wati &amp; Ors., 155 (2008)
DLT 383 that in a rent petition for bonafide requirement, the petitioners
should be more than the tenant. In this case, petitioners are more than
tenants and the ground raised by the respondents are not a triable issue.
</p><p id="p_21">             The respondents also contended that civil litigation pending
between the petitioners and the legal heirs of Mohd. Wahiduddin wherein
legal heirs of Mohd. Wahiduddin have claimed themselves to be the
owner of the suit property. I feel that this litigation does not affect the
present case of the petitioner as till date the said suit has not been
decided against the petitioners and as of today, petitioners are the owner
of the property in question by virtue of sale deed dated 13.08.1993.
</p><p id="p_22">             In view of above, both the contentions of the respondents are
dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_23">8.           As per petitioners, the petitioner no.1 is in possession of
only three rooms, kitchen which are highly insufficient for his three grown
up daughters and one grown up son. But it is contended by the
respondents that the petitioner no.1 is having three rooms on the ground
floor and one room on the first floor. The petitioners have placed on
record site plan of property in question i.e. no.2648. The petitioner no.1

E­134/2010                                                                 5/9
 has shown in green colour, the accommodation available with him.          He
has shown two rooms on ground floor and one room on the first floor in
his possession. In support of his contention, the respondents have not
filed any site plan to show that petitioner no.1 is in possession of three
rooms on the ground floor and one room on the first floor. It has been
held in 1986 RLR 232 <a href="/doc/1954525/" id="a_1">R.K. Bhatnagar vs. Sushila Bhargav</a> and 1995
RLR 527 <a href="/doc/1196732/" id="a_2">Jagmohan Singh vs K.M. Bhatnagar</a> that if a tenant does not
file any site plan, the site plan filed by petitioners is assumed to be
correct. Hence, the site plan filed by petitioners is assumed to be correct
and it is held that petitioners no.1 is in possession of only three rooms.
The family of petitioner no.1 consisting of he himself, his wife, five
daughters (out of which two are married) and one son who is of
marriageable age. The respondents also contended that out of three
unmarried daughter of petitioner no.1, two will get marry soon. I feel that
the requirement of accommodation continues even after marriage of
daughters. Besides this, I also feel that family of petitioners no.1 cannot
be forced to live in three rooms and they have right to live in the property
comfortably. So far as other portion of property in question is concerned,
the same is in possession of petitioners no.2 to 9 and therefore, it cannot
be said to available to the petitioner no.1 to satisfy his bonafide
requirement. petitioner to run his own business and the same are not
lying vacant. Besides this, it is settled law that the landlord is the master
of his own choice with regard to select the premises for his bonafide
needs. It has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in John
Impex Vs. Surinder Singh, 2007 (1) AD 89 and Sait Nagjee (P.) Co.
Vs. Vimala Bhai 1995 SCC 252 that the landlord is best judge of his
requirements and tenant cannot dictate to him. The respondent being
tenant cannot dictate the terms of eviction of tenanted premises to the
petitioner. Infact, it is not a triable issue as in view of above, I am of the
considered opinion that petitioners have no sufficient accommodation
available in property in question.
</p>
<p id="p_24">E­134/2010                                                                  6/9
</p><p id="p_25"> 9.           The respondents also contended that petitioners also have
sufficient accommodation in property no.5357. With respect of this
property, the petitioners in the petition clearly averred that the same is
being used for carrying on business by the petitioners and therefore, it is
not suitable for residence and same is approx. 3 kms. away from property
no.2648 and that they do not want to use the same for residential
purposes as they were born and brought in the property in question i.e.
no.2648 and it is being utilized and suitable for their residence. If
petitioner no.1 wants to live in the property in question coupled with the
fact that property no. 5357 is being used for commercial purposes, I feel
that petitioner no.1 cannot be forced to shift to said property which is not
suitable to him just to protect the tenancy of the respondents. Besides
this, it is settled law that the landlord is the master of his own choice with
regard to select the premises for his bonafide needs. Therefore, the
objection of respondents with respect to property no.5357 is dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_26">10.          The respondents also contended that they have no other
place for the purpose of their residence and they are residing the
premises in question with respective families (20 persons in number) in
the portion yellow and red shown in the site plan.
</p><p id="p_27">             By way of this contention that respondents have put before
this Court their comparative hardship or need but there is no provision in
the Act to evaluate the comparative hardships or need. Therefore, this
contention of the respondent is not sustainable and dismissed as such.
</p>

<p id="p_28">11.          The respondents also contended that the petitioners even
own a property in Wazirabad, Delhi. The petitioners have denied the
same. I feel that in support to their contentions, the respondents ought to
placed on record some documents which suggest that petitioners are in
possession of same or owners of same. Hence, it seems that

E­134/2010                                                                  7/9
 respondents have raised a bald contention.
</p>

<p id="p_29">12.          All the ground taken by the respondent are baseless and the
case of the petitioner is squarely falls within the ratio of the law laid down
by the Hon'ble High Court in case cited as 2009 VIII AD (Delhi) 445
wherein it was observed in para no.14 of the judgment that ".... due to
paucity of accommodation the tenants are likely to plead facts with a view
to create triable issues even in case where there may be none, so as to
seek leave to defend the eviction petition filed on the ground of bonafide
requirement of the landlord. This is so because upon grant of leave to
defend, the eviction proceedings are likely to take considerable time for
disposal as a regular trial would ensue. Therefore, even if a tenant has
no triable issue to raise, he still endeavors to prolong the litigation so as
to postpone the date when he is faced with eviction........"
</p>

<p id="p_30">13.          <a href="/doc/1287726/" id="a_3">In Nem Chand Daga v. Inder Mohan Singh Rana</a>, 94
(2001) DLT 683 it was held that before leave to defend is granted, the
respondent must show that some triable issues which disentitled the
applicant from getting the order of eviction against the respondent and at
the same time entitled the respondent to leave to defend existed. The
onus is prima facie on the respondent and if he fails, the eviction follows.
</p>

<p id="p_31">14.          Considering, the whole facts and circumstances, I am of the
view that respondents have not been able to show existence of any
triable issue whereas petitioners have been able to show that they have
no sufficient space available with them for meeting out requirement of
petitioner no.1 and the premises in occupation of respondents is
bonafidely required by petitioner no.1.
</p>

<p id="p_32">15.          Accordingly, the application for leave to defend is dismissed
and consequently, eviction order is hereby passed in favour petitioners

E­134/2010                                                                  8/9
 and against the respondents with regard to entire tenanted premises in
question shown in red and yellow colour comprising one room dalan,
open courtyard in the ground floor and tin shed in the first floor in the site
plan which is exhibited today as Ex.X. It is made clear that this order will
not be executable till expiry of six months from today. File be consigned
to record room.
