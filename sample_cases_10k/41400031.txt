24/28.03.2018     In the accompanied writ application, the petitioner has sought for a
</pre><p id="p_10">            direction to the respondents not to modify/withdraw or recover one extra
            increment given to the petitioner as an incentive under the Bihar
            Government Servant (Family Planning) Rule, 1977 and for quashing of
            the letter dated 12.11.2007 vide Annexure-4, passed by the respondent
            no. 4 pertaining to withdrawal and recovery of one increment from the
            salary of the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_11">            2.    The factual matrix, as has been delineated in the writ application,
            in a nutshell is that the Bihar Government Servant (Family Planning)
            Rule, 1977, which was under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_1">Article 309</a> of the Constitution of India, has
            been made for giving incentive to those employees under the United
            Bihar Government for the employees under 40 years of age those who
            have got two children for sterilization/'Nasbandi', himself or wife, one
            advance increment in a salary would be given. The petitioner while
            posted as Assistant at District Development Office, Dumka on
            22.10.1995, has got done his sterilization/'Nasbandi'. The Deputy
            Commissioner, Dumka vide order dated 31.01.1996 granted the incentive
            as per the Rule and the salary of the petitioner was increased with special
            increment as incentive as per Annexure-2 to the writ petition.
            Subsequently, vide letter dated 03.10.2002, issued by the Finance
            Department of Jharkhand, envisaged for modification of the provision of
            Family Planning from 01.01.1996 and the State employees as per the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              2</span>

new Scheme, will be given family planning allowance, which would be
equivalent to one yearly increment and it will remain static in the entire
service. In earlier provision under the Bihar Family Planning Rule, 1977,
an employee under 40 years of age and having two children were given
one advance increment in his salary, which has been merged in his salary
and the Dearness Allowance given on the salary. The Establishment
Deputy Collector issued an order dated 12.11.2007, stating therein, that
due to letter of the Finance Department, dated 03.10.2002 (Annexure-3),
extra increment of salary given to the petitioner is recoverable and
accordingly, a direction was issued for reducing the salary vide order
dated 12.11.2007 (Annexure-4 to the writ petition), which is impugned in
this writ application. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the
petitioner submitted a detailed representation to the respondent no. 3 and
subsequently, the petitioner also requested the District Account Officer,
Dumka, on 24.12.2007 by submitting a letter to seek clarification from
the Finance Department as to whether the letter dated 3.10.2002 of the
Finance Department would be applicable to the cases of the
sterilization/'Nasbandi', which was done in case of the petitioner on
22.10.1995 and the District Accounts Officer, Dumka sought for
guidelines and instructions from the Special Secretary, Finance
Department, Jharkhand, Ranchi vide Annexure-7, but, due to non-receipt
of any clarification from the concerned authorities, the petitioner left
with no alternative has been compelled to approach this Court under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India seeking redressal of his
grievances.
</p><p id="p_12">3.    Learned counsel for the petitioner has strenuously urged that the
action of the respondents in directing recovery from the salary of the
petitioner, the incentive, which was given as special increment, amounts
to illegal and arbitrary exercise of power. Learned counsel further
submits that one extra yearly increment granted as per the Bihar
Government Servant (Family Planning) Rule, 1977 vide order dated
31.01.1996 could not have been withdrawn and the order of recovery
from the salary of the petitioner could not have been made, when the
date of sterilization/'Nasbandi' of the petitioner is 22.10.1995. Learned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                3</span>

counsel for the petitioner further submits that the letter of the
Finance Department, dated 03.10.2002, does not envisage that the State
employees, who have got done their sterilization/'Nasbandi' before
01.01.1996 and who have got one year's special increment, which has
been merged in their salary under the Bihar Government Servant (Family
Planning) Rule, 1977 and therefore, the same, which has been withdrawn
and changed with retrospective effect by the impugned order dated
12.11.2007, issued by the respondent no. 4 in the light of Clause-10 of
Annexure-3, is not legally justifiable. Learned counsel further submits
that the letter of the Finance Department, dated 3.10.2002 makes it
abundantly clear that the new Scheme would be applicable to only those
employees, who have got 'Nasbandi'/sterilization done on or after
1.1.1996, which is the cut-off date and the letter dated 3.10.2002 of the
Finance Department, nowhere contains recovery of the special annual
increment to those employees, who have got sterilization/'Nasbandi'
done before 1.1.1996, therefore, the action of the respondents in directing
recovery from the salary of the incentive from the salary of the petitioner
from 01.04.1997, cannot be legally tenable. Learned counsel further
submits that in the instant case, before issuance of the impugned order,
no show cause notice has been given to the petitioner and the principles
of natural justice has not been followed. Learned counsel for the
petitioner has further referred to Annexure-8 of the rejoinder to the
counter affidavit, whereby letter No. 4388, dated 06.07.2009, issued by
the Chief Secretary to all the Secretaries directing for observance of
principles of natural justice before ordering of any recovery from the
salary. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the impugned
order is also in breach of principles of natural justice.
</p><p id="p_13">4.    Controverting the averments made in the writ application, a
counter affidavit has been filed by the respondents, wherein, it has been
submitted that the petitioner has got operated Family Planning
('Nasbandi') on 22.10.1995 and as per the letter dated 31.01.1996 of the
Deputy Commissioner, Dumka an additional increment was sanctioned
to the petitioner with effect from 20.02.1996. His normal date of
increment in the pay-scale of Rs.1400-40-1800-50-2300 was due on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                              4</span>

22.02.1996 and this increment was sanctioned to him as per the
Government letter dated 26.11.1990, issued by the Personnel and
Administrative Reforms Department, Bihar, Patna. Later on, as per letter
dated 03.10.2002, the previous letter, issued in this regard, was modified
and an Incentive Allowance was introduced in place of additional
increment with effect from 01.01.1996 on account of Family Planning
done by the Government Servant. It has further been submitted that as
per the last paragraph no. 11 of the Government letter dated 03.10.2002,
referred to above, it has been decided that any additional increment
sanctioned in view of the old Circular, the same should be modified and
accordingly, the previous order contained in memo dated 31.01.1996 was
modified vide order dated 12.11.2007 and the petitioner has been
allowed incentive allowance in place of additional increment. This
incentive allowance was equal to his one increment.
</p><p id="p_14">5.    A counter affidavit dated 17.11.2017, has been filed on behalf of
the respondent No. 2, wherein, it has been submitted that as per the
provisions of Bihar Government Servant (Family Planning) Rule, 1977, a
government servant was entitled to one extra increment. This extra
increment used to be merged with his basic salary as a result of which,
the employees become entitled to Dearness Allowance on this amount
also. The State of Jharkhand in the Department of Finance issued letter
dated 03.10.2002 in this regard as per Annexure-A to the counter
affidavit. Clause-10 of the said Circular provides that those employees
who have undergone vesectomy prior to 01.01.1996 would be entitled to
incentive of one advance increment, which would form part of basic
salary and fixation has been done in revised pay scale on the same from
01.01.1996, such government employees would be not entitled to
separate family planning allowance. It has further been submitted that
Clause-11 of the said Circular further provided that the decision would
be effective from 01.01.1996. It has further been submitted that the
petitioner has undergone vesectomy on 22.10.1995, however, he was
granted the benefit of family planning allowance with effect from
22.02.1996 by respondent no. 4 through letter dated 31.01.1996 and
hence, in terms of Clause 11 of the said circular an amended pay slip had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 5</span>

to be issued to be petitioner, wherein, the additional extra increment
given to the petitioner would not form part of his basic salary. In other
words, the petitioner was not entitled to the benefit provided in Clause 10
of the said Circular, since, he had been granted the said benefit after
1.1.1996.
</p><p id="p_15">6.    Learned counsel for the Respondent-State apartfrom reiterating the
submissions made in the counter affidavit, has vociferously defended the
action of the respondents by submitting that there is absolutely no
illegality in issuing Annexure-4 to the writ petition and the same
warrants no interference by this Court.
</p><p id="p_16">7.    After hearing the learned counsel for the respective parties and on
perusal of the records, this Court is of the considered view that the
petitioner has been able to make out a case for interference due to the
following facts, reasons and judicial pronouncements : -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            (i)      Admittedly, in the case in hand , the petitioner got
            done sterilization/'Nasbandi' while being posted as Assistant at
            District Development Office, Dumka and was entitled to
            incentive as per the Bihar Government Servant (Family
            Planning) Rule, 1977. Subsequently, vide letter dated
            3.10.2002, issued by the Finance Department, the Family
            Planning incentive got modified from 1.1.1996 and the special
            incentive given to the petitioner for sterilization/'Nasbandi'
            done on 20.10.1995 got withdrawn in view of the new Scheme
            and the order was passed by the Respondents for recovery of
            the amount from the salary of the petitioner from 01.04.1997
            vide order dated 12.11.2007 (Annexure-4 to the writ
            application). Admittedly, prior to the issuance of the impugned
            order, no notice was ever issued to the petitioner for recovery
            of the amount from the salary of the petitioner and there has
            been flagrant violation of the principles of natural justice. On
            that score alone, the impugned order vide Annexure-4 is not
            legally sustainable for breach of the principles of natural justice
            apart from being violative of Articles 14, 16 and 300 A of the
            Constitution of India. On perusal of Clause-10 of the new
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     6</span>

                Scheme dated 3.10.2002, nowhere does it envisage that any
                benefit which has been given to an employee can be withdrawn
                in the subsequent Scheme and therefore, the new Scheme could
                not have been applied to the petitioner retrospectively.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                (ii)     The view of the Court gets fortified in view of the fact
                that the Hon'ble Apex Court has consistently taken the view
                that a quasi-judicial or administrative decision rendered in
                violation of the audi alteram partem rule, wherever it can be
                read as an implied requirement of the law, is null and void. In
                the facts and circumstances of the instant case, there has been a
                non-compliance with such implied requirement of the audi
                alteram partem rule of natural justice at the pre-decisional
                stage. The impugned order therefore, could be struck down as
                invalid on that score alone. For the reference of the aforesaid
                view, the decision reported in (1981) 1 SCC 664, <a href="/doc/859161/" id="a_3">Swadeshi
                Cotton Mills-vs.-Union of India</a> may be referred to.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                (iii)    Therefore, the adjudicatory process essentially has to
                be in consonance with the principles of natural justice,
                including the doctrine of audi alteram partem. Hearing the
                parties, application of mind and recording of reasoned decision
                are the basic elements of natural justice as per the decision of
                the Hon'ble Apex Court reported in (2012) 13 SCC 14,
                <a href="/doc/136770833/" id="a_4">Manohar-vs.-State of Maharashtra and Another</a>.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      8.    In view of the reasons stated in the foregoing paragraphs, this
      Court is inclined to interfere in the impugned order. Accordingly, the
      impugned order dated 12.11.2007, issued by the Respondent No. 4 vide
      Annexure-4 to the writ petition being not legally sustainable, is hereby
      quashed and set aside. Resultantly, the writ petition, stands allowed.</blockquote>
