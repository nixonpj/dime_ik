               ---------------------------------------
            Dated this the 5th day of January, 2018

                            JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner's mother-in-law late Safiya Beevi availed a

loan from the 2nd respondent Bank and in the said loan

transaction the petitioner stood as a guarantor. Safiya Beevi

expired two years ago. The tenure of the loan was 15 years from

15.10.2010. Though the monthly instalments of Rs.2,500/- was

remitted without fail till 01.05.2014, repayment was defaulted

thereafter. In view of the default, the 2nd respondent Bank

initiated recovery proceedings and proceeded against the

property owned by the petitioner by issuing Exts.P2, P3 &amp; P4

auction notices. In view of the coercive steps taken by the 2nd

respondent Bank, the petitioner has approached this Court in this

writ petition, seeking a writ of certiorari to quash Exts.P2, P3 &amp;

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C) No.24146 of 2017        2</span>


P4 notices and also to direct the respondents to grant her

sufficient time to repay the overdue amount and regularise the

loan account.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. On 20.07.2017 when this writ petition came up for

admission, this Court admitted the matter on file and issued

notice to the respondents by Speed Post.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3. On 03.01.2018, when this writ petition came up for

further consideration, the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent

Bank submitted that since the borrower is no more, regularisation

of the loan account by payment of overdues is not permissible.

The learned counsel for the petitioner sought time to get

instructions and accordingly, the writ petition is listed today for

further consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and also the

learned counsel for the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5. The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that

the petitioner is prepared to pay off the entire amount

outstanding in the loan account in question, i.e., PNFH 147/2010-

11 in monthly instalments.
</p>
<p id="p_6"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C) No.24146 of 2017           3</span>


</p><p id="p_7">      6. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent Bank would

submit that the total amount outstanding in the loan account in

question, as on date, comes to Rs.2,74,140/- [Rupees Two lakhs

seventy four thousand one hundred and forty only] and that, the

2nd respondent Bank has no objection in this Court granting

reasonable time to the petitioner for repayment.

</p><p id="p_8">      7. Having considered the rival submissions, this writ petition

is disposed of with the following directions:

</p><p id="p_9">      (i) The petitioner shall pay off the entire amount

outstanding in respect of the loan account No.PNFH 147/2010-11

amounting to Rs.2,74,140/- together with future interest, in ten

equal monthly instalments commencing from 02.02.2018 and

the subsequent instalments payable on or before the 2nd day of

the succeeding months.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      (ii) If the petitioner is remitting the aforesaid instalments in

time, all recovery proceedings pursuant to Exts.P2, P3 &amp; P4

notices shall be kept in abeyance, so as to enable the petitioner

to pay off the entire liability in monthly instalments.

</p><p id="p_11">      (iii) In case of any default committed by the petitioner in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C) No.24146 of 2017        4</span>


remitting any one of the aforesaid instalments, it would be open

to the respondents to proceed further with the coercive steps for

recovering the said dues, in accordance with law.
