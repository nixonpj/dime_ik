(Arising out of SLP(C) No. 23840 of 2005)



S.B. Sinha, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">	Leave granted.
</p> 	
<p id="p_3"> 	The State of Rajasthan made a Scheme for supply of water in the 
villages known as "Jal Pradyot Yojna".  The State was to contribute 50% of 
the total costs whereas the rest 50% was to be borne by the Gram Panchayat.  
Pursuant to or in furtherance of the Scheme, the Gram Panchayat of 
Indragarh employed several persons including Respondent No. 1 herein as a 
pump driver.  He was initially appointed for a period of six months.  The 
term of his appointment was extended from time to time.  The total period 
during which Respondent No.1 remained employed was from 19.9.1996 to 
7.11.1997.  The Scheme was to be completed upto 7.11.1997.  As the 
Scheme came to an end, the services of Respondent No. 1 were terminated.  
He filed an application for his regularization of his services as a pump driver 
before the Labour Welfare and Conciliation Officer, Hanumagarh.  In reply 
to the notice issued by the said authority, the Public Health &amp; Engineering 
Department of the State inter alia contended that Respondent No. 1 had 
never been appointed by it and in fact was appointed by the Sarpanch of the 
Gram Panchayat, Indragarh.  
</p>
<p id="p_4">An industrial dispute was raised by Respondent No. 1 herein by filing 
an application before the Industrial Court.  By an award dated 9.5.2002, it 
was held that while terminating the services of Respondent No. 1 herein, the 
mandatory requirements of <a href="/doc/41851/" id="a_1">Section 25-G</a> and <a href="/doc/1476304/" id="a_2">25-H</a> of the Industrial Disputes 
Act were not complied with and consequently an award of reinstatement 
with continuity of service was passed by the Labour Court.  Respondent No. 
1 herein, however, was declared to be entitled to only 30% of the back 
wages.  The Labour Court while making the aforementioned award arrived 
at the following findings:
</p><p id="p_5">(i)	Respondent No. 1 herein had worked for a period of 13 months and 18 
days and the Gram Panchayat as well as the Department made 
payment of his wages.
</p><p id="p_6">(ii)	He had worked for more than 240 days.  As his services had been 
terminated by a written notice, statutory provisions of <a href="/doc/41851/" id="a_3">Sections 25-G</a> 
and <a href="/doc/1476304/" id="a_4">25-H</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act had not been complied with.
</p>
<p id="p_7"> 	A writ petition filed by Appellant herein was dismissed by a learned 
Single Judge of the High Court opining :
</p>
<p id="p_8">"It is not in dispute that the workman had worked for 
more than 240 days, as he had worked from 19.9.1996 to 
7.11.1997.  Learned counsel argued that the workman 
was appointed for a fixed term, and,  therefore, his 
removal does not amount to retrenchment in view of the 
provisions of <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_5">Section 2(oo)(bb)</a> of the Industrial Disputes 
Act.  However, learned counsel for the Petitioner could 
not point out any document whereby the requirements of 
<a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_6">Section 2(oo)(bb)</a> may be established."
</p>
<p id="p_9"> 	A Division Bench of the High Court in an intra-court appeal affirmed 
the said finding.
</p>
<p id="p_10"> 	The Scheme for supplying water in the villages was a joint Scheme of 
the State of Rajasthan through Public Health and Engineering Department 
and the Gram Panchayat.  There is nothing on records to show that 
Respondent No. 1 was appointed by the State.  It is not in dispute that he 
was initially appointed for a period of six months and that too by the 
Sarpanch Gram Panchayat.  Pursuant to or in furtherance of the Scheme, the 
Public Health and Engineering Department might have released payments of 
his salary but the same would not lead to the conclusion that the relationship 
of an employer and employee came into being.
</p>
<p id="p_11"> 	Furthermore, Respondent No. 1 was appointed for a fixed period.  His 
services might have continued but it appears that the same was to remain in 
force till the Scheme was completed.  
</p>
<p id="p_12">We may in the aforementioned backdrop notice the definition of 
'retrenchment' as contained in <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_7">Section 2(oo)(bb)</a> of the Industrial Disputes 
Act, which is in the following terms:
</p>
<p id="p_13">2(oo) "Retrenchment" means termination by the 
employer of the service of a workman for any reason 
whatsoever, otherwise than as a punishment inflicted by 
way of disciplinary action, but does not include  -
</p>
<p id="p_14">***			***			***

"(bb) termination of the service of the workman as 
a result of the non-renewal of the contract of employment 
between the employer and the workman concerned on its 
expiry or of such contract being terminated under a 
stipulation in that behalf contained therein;.."
</p>
<p id="p_15"> 	It is a case which attracts clause (bb) of <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_8">Section 2(oo)</a> of the Industrial 
Disputes Act. 	
</p>
 	
<p id="p_16"> 	<a href="/doc/770731/" id="a_9">In Municipal Council, Samrala vs. Raj Kumar</a> [(2006) 3 SCC 81], it 
was held :
</p><p id="p_17">"The appellant is a Municipal Council.  It is 
governed by the provisions of a statute.  The matter 
relating to the appointment of employees as also the 
terms and conditions of their services indisputably are 
governed by the provisions of the relevant Municipal Act 
and/or the rules framed thereunder.  Furthermore, there is 
no doubt that the matter relating to the employment in the 
Municipal Council should be governed by the statutory 
provisions and thus such offer of appointment must be 
made by a person authorised therefor.  The agenda in 
question was placed before the Executive Council with a 
view to obtain requisite direction from it wherefor the 
said letter was written.  The reason for such appointment 
on contract basis has explicitly been stated therein, 
namely, that one post was vacant and two employees 
were on leave and in that view of the matter, services of a 
person were immediately required in the Council.  Thus, 
keeping in view the exigency of the situation, the 
respondent came to be appointed on the terms and 
conditions approved by the Municipal Council.
</p>
<p id="p_18">We have noticed hereinbefore that the respondent 
understood that his appointment would be short-lived.  
He furthermore understood that his services could be 
terminated at any point of time as it was on a contract 
basis.  It is only in that view of the matter, as noticed 
hereinbefore, that he affirmed an affidavit stating that the 
Municipal Council of Samrala could dispense with his 
services and that they have a right to do so."
</p>
<p id="p_19"> 	The said decision has been followed by this Court in <a href="/doc/940349/" id="a_10">Municipal 
Council, Samrala v. Sukhwinder Kaur</a>, [2006 (7) SCALE 614] wherein the 
offer of appointment to Respondent therein was in the following terms:
</p><p id="p_20">       "Office of the Nagar Council, Samrala (Ludhiana)

No.588			     	          Dated : 06.11.1995

Office Order No.

On dated 6.11.1995 vide order dated 6.11.1995 
you are appointed as clerk on the contract basis at the 
fixed rate of Rs.1000/- per month as per the directions of 
the Government, it is purely temporary appointment.  No 
one will force against this post.  Executive Officer has 
the powers to dismiss you without issuing any notice.  
All the terms and conditions issued by the office will be 
accepted by you.  
</p>
<p id="p_21">				    Sd/- Executive Officer
			           Nagar Council, Samrala"
</p>
<p id="p_22"> 	Such an offer of appointment was held to attract <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_11">Section 2(oo)(bb)</a> of 
the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_23"> 	The learned counsel appearing on behalf of Respondent No. 1 placed 
strong reliance on <a href="/doc/138212981/" id="a_12">S.M. Nilajkar &amp; Ors. v. Telecom District Manager, 
Karnataka</a> [(2003) 4 SCC 27].  The said decision was explained and held to 
have been applied in the fact situation obtaining therein by this Court in Raj 
Kumar (supra) stating:
</p>
<p id="p_24">"In the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/138212981/" id="a_13">S.M. Nilajkar v. 
Telecom Distt</a>. Manager whereupon the learned counsel 
for the respondent placed strong reliance, this Court was 
concerned with a different fact situation obtaining 
therein.  In that case, a scheme for absorption of the 
employees who were appointed for digging, laying 
cables, erecting poles, drawing lines and other connected 
works was made which came into force with effect from 
1-10-1989, and only those whose names were not 
included for regularisation under the said scheme, raised 
disputes before the Assistant Labor Commissioner, 
Mangalore.  The termination of the services of casual 
mazdoors by the management of Telecom District 
Manager, Belgaum, thus came to be questioned in the 
reference made by the appropriate Government in 
exercise of its power conferred upon it under <a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_14">Section 10</a> 
of the Industrial Disputes Act.  This Court, having regard 
to the contentions raised by the respondents that the 
appellant therein was engaged in a particular type of 
work, namely, digging, laying cables, erecting poles, 
drawing lines and other connected works in the project 
and expansion of the Telecom Office in the district of 
Belgaum was of the opinion : (SCC p.37, para 13)

"13. The termination of service of a workman 
engaged in a scheme or project may not amount to 
retrenchment within the meaning of sub-clause (bb) 
subject to the following conditions being satisfied :
</p>
<p id="p_25">(i) that the workman was engaged in a project or 
scheme of temporary duration;
</p>
<p id="p_26">(ii) the employment was on a contract, and not as a 
daily-wager simpliciter, which provided inter alia that the 
employment shall come to an end on the expiry of the 
scheme or project;
</p>
<p id="p_27">(iii) the employment came to an end 
simultaneously with the termination of the scheme or 
project and consistently with the terms of the contract; 
and
</p><p id="p_28">(iv)the workman ought to have been apprised or 
made aware of the abovesaid terms by the employer at 
the commencement of employment."  
</p>
<p id="p_29"> Raj Kumar (supra) has also been followed by this Court in <a href="/doc/1945894/" id="a_15">The 
Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board v. Subhash Chand &amp; Anr</a>. 
[2006 (2) SCALE 614] stating :
</p><p id="p_30">"It is the contention of the appellant that the 
respondent was appointed during the 'wheat season' or 
'paddy season'.  It is also not in dispute that the appellant 
is a statutory body constituted under the Punjab and 
Haryana Agriculture Produce Marketing Board Act.  In 
terms of the provisions of the said Act, indisputably, 
regulations are framed by the Board laying down terms 
and conditions of services of the employees working in 
the Market Committees.  A bare perusal of the offer of 
appointment clearly goes to show that the appointments 
were made on contract basis.  It was not a case where a 
workman was continuously appointed with artificial gap 
of 1 day only.  Indisputably, the respondent had been re-
employed after termination of his services on contract 
basis after a considerable period(s).
</p>
<p id="p_31">The question as to whether Chapter VA of the Act 
will apply or not would dependent on the issue as to 
whether an order of retrenchment comes within the 
purview of <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_16">Section 2(oo)(bb)</a> of the Act or not.  If the 
termination of service in view of the exception contained 
in clauses (bb) of <a href="/doc/1418464/" id="a_17">Section 2(oo)</a> of the Act is not a 
'retrenchment', the question of applicability of Chapter 
VA thereof would not arise."
</p>
<p id="p_32"> 	It is now well settled that although the Labour Court possesses 
discretionary jurisdiction in moulding the relief in terms of <a href="/doc/1968818/" id="a_18">Section 11-A</a> o 
the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_19">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, the power thereunder must be judicially 
exercised.  Respondent No. 1 herein was appointed under a Scheme.  He was 
appointed for a specific purpose.  The fact that his initial appointment was 
for a period of six months is not disputed.  The concept of there being 'dual 
employer' although may not be unknown in industrial jurisprudence but the 
Labour Court, in our opinion, misdirected itself in holding that the 
termination of his services by Appellant was illegal being in violation of 
<a href="/doc/41851/" id="a_20">Sections 25-G</a> and <a href="/doc/1476304/" id="a_21">25-H</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act.  If the Gram 
Panchayat was in management of the Scheme, the employer would be the 
Panchayat and not the State.  In fact, Respondent No. 1 herein impleaded 
both of them as parties.  The learned Labour Court and consequently the 
High Court failed to consider this vital aspect of the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_33">	<a href="/doc/571829/" id="a_22">In State of M..P. and Ors. v. Arjunlal Rajak</a> [2006 (2) SCALE 610], 
this Court opined:
</p><p id="p_34">"It is, however, true that while terminating the services 
of the respondent the appellants had not complied with 
the mandatory requirements of <a href="/doc/1056316/" id="a_23">Section 25F</a> of the 
Industrial Disputes Act and, thus, ordinarily, the 
workman could have been directed to be reinstated with 
or without back wages, but it is also well settled that a 
project or a Scheme or an office itself is abolished, relief 
by way of reinstatement is not granted."
</p>
<p id="p_35"> 	In terminating the services of Respondent No. 1, we would assume 
that violation of <a href="/doc/41851/" id="a_24">Sections 25-G</a> or 25-H occurred (although there is no 
factual basis therefor), but in any event, the same would not mean that the 
Labour Court should have automatically passed an award of reinstatement in 
service with back wages.  We, however, although ordinarily would have set 
aside the impugned award and consequently the judgment of the High Court; 
in exercise of our jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_25">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of India, 
we direct the State to pay a sum of Rs. 30,000/- to Respondent No. 1.  Such 
payment should be made within eight weeks from date failing which the 
same shall carry interest at the rate of 9% per annum.  The appeal is allowed 
with the aforesaid directions.  The parties shall pay and bear their own costs.
