                                        ... RESPONDENT

(BY SRI.B.VISWESWARAIAH - HCGP)

     THIS CRL.P IS FILED U/S.438 CR.P.C PRAYING TO
ENLARGE THE PETITIONERS ON BAIL IN CRIME
NO.130/2013 ON THE FILE OF THE III ADDL. C.J. (JR.DN.)
AND JMFC COURT, TUMKUR.

     THIS CRIMINAL PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING :

                       ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     The petitioners, who are arrayed as A1, A3 and A5

in Crime No.130/13 of Hebbur police station registered

for the offences under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_1">Sections 498A</a>, <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_2">304B</a> of IPC and

under Sections 3 and 4 of the D.P. Act 1961, are before

this Court praying for enlarging them on bail.

</p><p id="p_2">     2.   It is alleged the deceased Nagarathna was

married to A1 on the ground he also belongs to 'Gowda'

community. After the marriage in due course of time it

was revealed A1 and his family members i.e. the

accused do not belong to the community of deceased

and they belong to 'Dombaru' community and hence,

some differences arose between the two families. Such

being the position it is alleged the accused were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                             3</span>


subjecting the deceased to cruelty and harassment in

order to bring more dowry from her parents house. In

the meantime the deceased gave birth to a female child

aged 1Â½ years as on the date of occurrence i.e.

16.8.2013. Since the deceased was being subjected to

cruelty and harassment both mentally and physically

the deceased on 16.8.2013 in between 5.30 and 7.30

p.m. committed suicide by hanging in the house of her

mother situated at Lakkenahalli. Since the accused had

subjected the deceased to cruelty and harassment on

account of which the deceased has committed suicide,

the case has been registered and investigation is taken

up.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3. The learned counsel for the petitioners at the

outset submitted at this stage he would not press the

petition of A1 who is the husband of the deceased

Nagarathna. Insofar as A3 and A5 are concerned he

submitted they are the Step mother and brother of A1.

He submits after the complainant's family raised the

dispute that accused family do not belong to 'Gowda'
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 4</span>


community, A1 left the house and started living

separately with the deceased. He submits since A1 was

living separately with the deceased and as A3 is the step

mother and A5 is the brother, it cannot be said that

they had subjected the          deceased to cruelty and

harassment as alleged by the prosecution. He further

contends A2 who is the father of A1 and A4 who is the

grand      mother   of   A1   have    already   been   granted

anticipatory bail by this Court and the Jurisdictional

Sessions Court respectively.         These petitioners are in

custody since 17.8.2013. They are no more required for

the purpose of investigation. He further submits as on

today, the investigation is completed and the final report

has also been filed before the Committal Court. Hence,

under these circumstances, he prays for enlarging them

on bail.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4.     The application filed by the petitioners is

opposed by the State.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5. A3 and A5 are the step mother and brother of

A1.   A2 who is the father of A1 and A4 who is the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   5</span>


grandmother of A1 have been granted Anticipatory Bail

by this Court and the Jurisdictional Sessions Court.

These petitioners are in custody since 17.8.2013.

Investigation is completed and charge sheet is also filed,

since A1 is said to have been living with the deceased

separately ever since differences arose between the two

families on account of the accused family do not belong

to the community of the complainant and further taking

into consideration that they are step mother and

brother of the accused. In the circumstances, I do not

find   any   justification   to       decline   the   request   of

petitioners 2 and 3.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       6. Accordingly, I proceed to pass the following :-

</p><p id="p_7">                        ORDER

</p><p id="p_8">1) The Petition filed by petitioner No.1/A1 is dismissed

as not pressed;
</p>
<p id="p_9">2) The Petition filed by petitioners 2 and 3, who are A3

and A5, is allowed; They are ordered to be released on

bail on each of them executing a personal bond in a

sum of Rs.50,000/- with one surety for the likesum to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              6</span>


the satisfaction of the Committal Court subject to the

following conditions :-
</p>
<p id="p_10">i) They shall not tamper with the prosecution witnesses;

ii They shall attend the court on all the dates of hearing.



</p><p id="p_11">                                          (Sd/-)
