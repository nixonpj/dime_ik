restraining the defendants, their servants, agents, representatives and

1 and other plaintiffs in any manner whatsoever with costs of the suit.

</p><p id="p_2">2.      Brief facts of the case as set out in the plaint is that the  plaintiff 

no. 1 is a Union registered under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1980557/" id="a_3">The Trade Unions

suit has been filed on behalf of plaintiff no. 1 through Mr. S.L. Raina - 

Secretary of   plaintiff no. 1 who has been authorized to institute the 

present proceedings vide resolution dated 27.04.2010.  Plaintiff no. 1 

is the recognized and majority union of the employees of defendant 

no. 2 having about 225 employees as its members.  The defendant no. 

1   is   the   statutory   body   empowered   to   grant   the   registration   of   the 

Trade Unions under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1980557/" id="a_4">The Trade Unions Act</a>, 1926 and

 between   the  union  or the workman/employee and the management. 

Defendant no. 2 is a public sector undertaking and the employer of the 

members of plaintiff no. 1. Defendant no. 3 is the office of government 

controlling and regulating the functioning of defendant no. 1. 

</p><p id="p_3">3.      It is stated that Mr. Raj Solanki had been occupying the office 

of the Secretary of plaintiff no. 1 from 14.10.2001 to 24.02.2010 and 

he  had been replaced from the said post of Secretary by passing a 

resolution   by   the   Executive   Committee   on   24.02.2010   due   to   the 

reason that the pending issues of the Union were not taken up properly 

with the management. Mr. Solanki was therefore constrained to vacate 

the office of Secretary. The elections to the Executive Committee are 

held after every two years as per the Rules as amended on 9.10.1985 

and duly intimated to defendant no. 1 on 9.10.1985. The plaintiffs no. 

2   to   5   are   currently   occupying   the   offices   of   Secretary,   President, 

Treasurer and Joint Secretary in the plaintiff no. 1.  It is alleged that 

Mr. Raj Solanki after being removed from the post of Secretary on 

24.3.2010 started working to the detriment of the plaintiff no. 1 in 

order to cause harm and break the union into small fractions. He had 

initiated malicious propaganda against plaintiffs and it has been learnt 

that   he   had   floated   another   union   by   the   name   and   style   of   SAIL 

Employees' Union Corporate Office registered with defendant no. 1 in 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS No. 435/2010                                                       Page No. 4 of 30</span>
 March, 2010. The plaintiff no. 1 has been functioning throughout and 

participating actively in the union activities and defendant no. 2 was 

providing returning officer in all the elections of the union in order to 

hold free and fair election. The defendant no. 2 signed number of bi­

partite agreement with plaintiff no. 1. The defendant no. 1 in collusion 

and connivance with Mr. Raj Solanki had tried to break the unity of 

plaintiff no. 1  and tried to suppress and disintegrate the plaintiff no. 1. 

</p><p id="p_4">4.      Plaintiffs have alleged that no notice or show cause notice or 

any other letter had ever been received by them from the defendant no. 

1   or   any   other   authority   before   the   alleged   cancellation   of   the 

registration of plaintiff no. 1. The plaintiffs had tried to acquire the 

information with regard to the status of plaintiff no. 1 in the records of 

defendant no. 1 but it was informed that the file relating to the plaintiff 

no. 1 had been misplaced and was not readily available. The plaintiffs 

wrote a letter dated 12.3.2010 to defendant no. 1 pointing out that the 

status of plaintiff no. 1 had been wrongly shown as cancelled and the 

same should be corrected but no action had been taken by defendant 

no.   1.   The   plaintiff   no.   1   sent   another   letter   dated   6.4.2010   to 

defendant no. 1 and also sent another letter dated 13.4.2010 addressed 

to Labour Commissioner, Delhi. Despite the service of said letters / 

communications, the defendant no. 1 has not corrected the status of 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS No. 435/2010                                                       Page No. 5 of 30</span>
 plaintiff no. 1 on the website and it appears that the status has been 

malafidely reflected as cancelled on the website in collusion with Mr. 

Raj Solanki.  The records and registers of plaintiff no. 1 which were 

kept   at   the   registered   office   of   plaintiff   no.   1   and   were   under   the 

control of Mr. Raj Solanki have been stolen by him and these have not 

been returned to the new office bearers. A complaint dated 3.5.2010 in 

this regard has also been lodged with the SHO P.S. Lodhi Colony and 

the   Commissioner   of   Police,   New   Delhi.   The   defendant   no.   1   has 

issued   a   letter   No.   F.5/DLC/SD/10/DRTU/4374   dated   30.4.2010   in 

response to the letter written by defendant no. 2 regarding the status of 

plaintiff no. 1 and the rival union stating that registration of plaintiff 

no. 1 has been cancelled. It is averred that no show cause notice has 

been served upon the plaintiffs by defendant no. 1 before the alleged 

cancellation of registration. The order, if any, passed at the back of 

plaintiffs is illegal. Plaintiffs allege that no order of cancellation of the 

registration of plaintiff no. 1 has been served upon them till date. The 

alleged cancellation of registration of plaintiff no. 1 is illegal and is 

liable   to   be   declared   as   such   and   defendant   no.   2   is   liable   to   be 

restrained from treating the plaintiff no. 1 as unregistered union. The 

plaintiffs   sent   a   legal   notice   to   defendant   no.   1   on   01.05.2010   but 

despite service of legal notice the grievances of plaintiff has not been

<p id="p_5">5.      The   suit   filed   by   the   plaintiffs   has   been   contested   by   the 

defendant no. 1 by way of filing written statement.   The defendant 

admitted that plaintiff no. 1 / Steel Authority Employees Union was 

registered with the defendant on 13.10.1977 vide registration no. 2252. 

It is stated that the said union was cancelled due to non submission of 

Annual Return prior to 1989. The list of cancelled union has already 

been published on the website of labour department since 2006. The 

defendant   has   followed   all   the   procedures   before   cancellation   of 

registration of plaintiff's union. The plaintiff did not file any appeal 

against the order of cancellation of registered Trade union as per the 

provisions of <a href="/doc/94218972/" id="a_5">Section 11</a> of The Trade Union Act, 1926 and Shri Raj 

Solanki,   Ex­General   Secretary   of   the   Steel   Authority   Employees 

Union   /   plaintiff   no.   1   was   also   aware   about   the   cancellation   of 

registration   of   plaintiff's   union.   The   plaintiff   has   already   filed   an 

application for restoration of Steel Authority Employees Union as a 

registered Trade Union before Deputy Registrar of Trade Union.

not   been   pursuing   its   activities   from   its   approved   registered   office 

where  the  show   cause  notice  might   have   been  served  on  it   by  the

registration.   Therefore,   the   alleged   cancellation   order   passed   by 

defendant no. 1 is illegal and null &amp; void. Learned counsel further 

argued that the status of plaintiffs' union has been shown as cancelled 

on the website of Labour Department while the cancellation order of 

plaintiffs'   union   is   not   available   on   the   website.   Learned   counsel 

further  submitted  that  there is infact  no cancellation order  showing 

cancellation of the plaintiff no. 1's union and therefore, even despite 

repeated directions of the court, the defendant no. 1 failed to produce 

the same even in the court. Learned counsel further argued that the 

defendant no. 1 is in hand and glove with defendant no. 4 and the 

defendant no. 1 malafidely cancelled the registration of the plaintiff 

no. 1's union. Learned counsel after drawing the attention of the court 

to the testimony of plaintiffs' witness, the documents proved by him 

during his deposition and other material available on record submitted 

that plaintiffs have proved their case against the defendants beyond all 

probability and therefore, the suit filed by the plaintiffs may kindly be 

decreed.

 plaintiff is bound to have constructive notice of the cancellation of its 

union   after   cancellation   order   has   been   passed.   It   was   further 

submitted that the plaintiffs are not entitled for a decree of declaration 

as   prayed   for   in   the   suit   as   they   have   failed   to   show   their   legal 

character   or   legal   existence.   Learned   counsel   for   defendant   further 

argued that the suit filed by the plaintiffs is liable to be dismissed as 

plaintiffs   did   not   serve   two   months   statutory   notice   upon   the 

defendants before filing the present suit against them. It was further 

argued   that   the   suit   filed   by   the   plaintiffs   is   barred   by   the   law   of 

limitation. It was further submitted that the plaintiffs have filed forged 

&amp; fabricated document in order to mislead the court. The original copy 

or true copy of the constitution of plaintiffs' union has not been filed 

by the plaintiffs but they have filed only the photocopy of the same 

and   therefore,   an   adverse   inference   should   be   drawn   against   the 

plaintiffs' union. Defendant no. 1 to 3 filed their written submissions 

wherein the objections have been taken for non­service of statutory 

notice   upon   the   defendants   prior   to   the   filling   of   the   suit.   The 

defendants also took the objection that this court has no jurisdiction to 

entertain the present suit as per <a href="/doc/94218972/" id="a_7">Section 11</a> of The Trade Union Act. It 

has also been stated that the present suit is barred by limitation as per

no. 2 did not have any role in cancellation of the registration of the 

trade union of plaintiff no. 1. It was submitted by counsel for all the 

defendants that plaintiffs have miserably failed to prove their case and 

therefore, the suit filed by them may kindly be dismissed.

his affidavit Mr. Bara has re­iterated the same facts which has been

<p id="p_16"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                             ISSUE NO. 2</span>
Whether the suit filed by the plaintiffs is liable to be dismissed for 
want of service of statutory notice under Section 80 of CPC before 
                    filing the present suit? OPD

</p><p id="p_17">15.      Onus   to   prove   this   issue   lies   upon   the   defendants.   The 

defendants took the objection in their written statement that no notice 

under   Section   80   CPC   was   served   upon   them   before   filing   of   the 

present suit and therefore, the suit filed by the plaintiffs is liable to be 

dismissed. The plaintiffs have admitted that no notice was served upon 

the  defendants  prior  to filing of the suit. It  was  submitted that  the 

plaintiffs moved an application under <a href="/doc/97606017/" id="a_9">Section 80(2)</a> r/w Section 151 

CPC for waiver of the statutory notice along with their suit. Since the 

application of plaintiffs has not been dismissed and the summons of 

the   suit   was   directed   to   be   issued   to   defendants,   therefore,   the 

permission to sue is deemed to have been granted by the court. On the 

other hand, counsel for defendants submitted that since the plaintiffs 

did not press for disposal of their application and therefore, it cannot 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">CS No. 435/2010                                                     Page No. 15 of 30</span>
 be said that the permission to sue the defendants was granted by the 

court and the service of prior notice was waived. Perusal of record 

shows that no relief was granted against the defendants by the court 

prior to their appearance in the court. The main purpose of service of 

prior notice upon a public authority is that the public authority may 

have the  intimation of the allegation levelled against it. The public 

authority may also get an opportunity to settle the matter with a party 

before   filing   of   the   suit.   The   defendants   became   aware   about   the 

allegations   levelled   against   them   when   summons   of   the   suit   was 

served upon them. Even prior to the filing of the suit the plaintiffs sent 

legal notice to defendant no. 1 which was not replied by them despite 

service   of   notice.   Thus,   defendants   were   aware   of   the   allegation 

levelled against them even prior to the filing of the suit in the court. 

The purpose of service of prior notice upon the defendants was served. 

No ex­parte relief was granted to the plaintiffs by the court against the 

defendants. The plaintiffs moved an application under <a href="/doc/97606017/" id="a_10">Section 80(2)</a> 

r/w Section 151 CPC for waiver of statutory notice along with the suit. 

When the court proceeded to issue summons to the defendants, the 

statutory requirement of service of prior notice upon the defendants is 

deemed to have been waived. In these circumstances, the suit filed by 

the   plaintiffs   cannot   be   dismissed   for   want   of   service   of   statutory

have written in their written statement that the registration of union of 

plaintiff no. 1 was cancelled. The date on which the registration was 

cancelled has not been furnished  by the defendants. The defendant no. 

1's witness Mr.  Peter Bara stated in his affidavit  that  the union of 

plaintiff no. 1 was cancelled due to non­submission of annual return 

prior to 1989. He further stated that the list of cancelled union has 

been published on the website of Labour Department since 2006. The 

defendant no. 1 is the competent authority to cancel the registration of 

a trade union. Neither in the written statement nor in the course of 

deposition,   the   defendants   have   provided   the   date   and   year   of 

cancellation of plaintiff no. 1. Thus, the defendants have miserably 

failed to prove on record that the registration of plaintiff no. 1 was 

cancelled. The court granted sufficient opportunity to defendant no. 1 

to produce the cancellation order in the court but despite sufficient

failed to produce the cancellation order. D1W1 Mr. Peter Bara in his 

cross examination could not tell the date when the status of plaintiff 

union was reflected as cancelled on the website of Labour Department. 

He admitted that the cancellation order of the registration of plaintiff's 

union was not available in the office of defendant no. 1. After hearing 

counsel for both the parties on the point of maintainability of the suit 

and   jurisdiction   of   the   Court   to   try   the   case,   this   Court   passed   a 

detailed order on 26.02.2011 holding that this court has jurisdiction to 

entertain and decide the present matter as the jurisdiction of this court 

is   neither   expressly   nor   impliedly   barred   by   the   statute.   Since   the 

finding has already been given by this court on the aforesaid aspect on

union can be cancelled are also provided in clause (b) of <a href="/doc/153148/" id="a_18">Section 10</a> of

L.A.B. I.C. 1700 that in order to invoke registration under <a href="/doc/153148/" id="a_20">Section 10</a> 

of the Act there must be sufficient material before the Registrar, that 

the   trade   union   concerned   should   have   willfully   contravened   any 

provision of the Act or any Rule. Unless the intentional violation of 

the   Rule   or   Act   is   established,   the   Registrar   cannot   cancel   the 

registration of a trade union.

union about the intentional violation of any of the provisions of the 

Act or any Rule.
</p>
<p id="p_28">24.            In the case in hand, the defendant no. 1 has alleged that 

the   registration   of   union   of   plaintiffs   was   cancelled   due   to   non­

submission of Annual Return prior to 1989. The cancellation order 

was never conveyed to the plaintiffs' Union. The defendant's witness 

Mr. Peter Bara himself stated that the list of cancelled union has been 

published on the website of Labour Department since 2006. He further 

stated that the defendant followed all procedure before cancellation of 

registration and the office bearers of trade union were all aware about 

the fact that status of union was cancelled after cancellation of trade 

union. He further stated that the plaintiff did not file any appeal against 

the order of registrar of trade union and Mr. Raj Solanki, ex­General 

Secretary of Steel Employees Union was also made aware of this fact 

that the registration of union was cancelled. The cancellation order has 

neither been supplied and communicated to the plaintiffs' union nor 

the same was filed in the court. Hence, there was no occasion for the 

plaintiffs to prefer an appeal against the cancellation order alleged to 

be   passed   by   defendant   no.   1.   The   defendant   no.   1   even   failed   to

 disclose as to when registration of plaintiffs' union was cancelled.

</p><p id="p_29">25.      The defendant no. 1 has miserably failed to prove on record 

that any show cause notice was ever issued and served upon plaintiffs' 

union or an opportunity of hearing was afforded to them prior to the 

cancellation of the registration of plaintiff no. 1. The defendant no. 1 

acted in gross violation of the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/153148/" id="a_23">Section 10</a> of 

The  Trade  Unions  Act  and also failed to  observe the principles  of 

natural justice before cancellation of the registration of trade union of 

plaintiffs.   Thus,   the   so   called   cancellation   order   passed   by   the 

Registrar is illegal, arbitrary and null &amp; void.
</p>
<p id="p_30">26.      Consequently,   the   letter   dated   30.04.2010   Ex.D1W1/P2 

whereby the Deputy Registrar communicated to the Deputy Labour 

Commissioner regarding the cancellation of trade union of plaintiffs, is 

also null &amp; void.

<p id="p_31">27.      Admittedly,   the   Steel   Authority   Employees'   Union   was 

registered with the defendant no. 1 on 13.10.1997 vide registration no. 

2252. As observed earlier, the registration of plaintiffs' trade union 

has not been validly cancelled by the Registrar. Mr. Raj Solanki, the 

Secretary of defendant no. 4, was ex­General Secretary of plaintiff no. 

1 for nearly 10 years from 2001 to 2010. He floated a new union in the 

name of SAIL Employees' Union Corporate Office in the year 2010 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">CS No. 435/2010                                                  Page No. 25 of 30</span>
 and   since   then   he   is   claiming   himself   to   be   its   Secretary.   In   his 

affidavit   Mr.   Raj   Solanki   has   alleged   that   the   plaintiff   has   falsely 

represented   to   this   court   that   its   Head   Office   is   located   at   Ispat 

Bhawan, Lodhi Road, Delhi. He has further stated that plaintiff has not 

filed any document to show that the change in the address of its Head 

Office   from   Hindustan   Times   House,   14th  Floor,   Kasturba   Gandhi 

Marg, New Delhi to its present alleged address at Ispat Bhawan was 

ever intimated to defendant no. 1. In the absence of the fulfillment of 

this condition precedent, the plaintiff has no right to contend that the 

cancellation   of   its   registration   is   bad   for   non­compliance   with   the 

principles of natural justice. Mr. Solanki himself remained ex­General 

Secretary   of   the  plaintiffs'  union for around 10 years.  In his cross 

examination he could not tell when the office of plaintiffs' union at 

Ispat Bhawan was shifted. He has stated that in the year 1996­97, he 

came to know that the office of plaintiff union was at Ispat Bhawan. 

He has also admitted that the address of Ispat Bhawan is mentioned on 

circular   dated   29.05.2004   Ex.PW1/D2.   This   circular   was   issued   by 

none other than Mr. Solanki himself. Thus, from the documents placed 

on   record,   it   is   seen   that   the   office   of   plaintiff   union   was  at   Ispat 

Bhawan   and   Mr.   Solanki   was   well   aware   of   it.   Moreover,   the 

defendant no. 1 has nowhere disputed the address of the Head Office 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">CS No. 435/2010                                                            Page No. 26 of 30</span>
 of plaintiff no. 1.
</p>
<p id="p_32">28.       The next contention of defendants is that the suit filed by the 

plaintiffs is time barred. The defendants have failed to show how the 

suit filed by the plaintiffs is time barred. It was submitted by counsel 

for defendants that the information to the effect that the registration of 

plaintiffs' union has been cancelled, had been placed on the website of 

Labour Department in the year 2006 in compliance with requirement 

of   <a href="/doc/13503/" id="a_24">Section   4</a>   of   The   Right   to   <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_25">Information   Act</a>.   The   internet   is 

accessible to the general public. Since the fact of cancellation of the 

status   of   the   plaintiffs'   union   had   been   put   in   public   domain,   the 

plaintiff is deemed to have a constructive notice thereof. The plaintiff 

with this constructive notice of information available in public domain 

like any reasonable and prudent person should have approached the 

court for the relief now being sought not in any case later than the year 

2009 in terms of <a href="/doc/1665174/" id="a_26">Article 58</a> of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_27">The Limitation Act</a>. The suit is clearly 

barred in terms of <a href="/doc/880040/" id="a_28">Section 3</a> of The Limitation Act, 1963. On the other 

hand,  it was submitted by counsel for plaintiffs that the suit is not 

barred   by   limitation   as   alleged   because   the   General   Secretary   of 

defendant   no.   4   had   been  occupying  the  office of  the  Secretary of 

plaintiff union from the year 2001 to 2010 and after being expelled 

from the plaintiff union, he started spreading rumours that registration 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">CS No. 435/2010                                                       Page No. 27 of 30</span>
 of plaintiff union has been cancelled. The office bearers of the plaintiff 

union took immediate steps and started communication with the office 

of defendant no. 1 in this regard. D1W1 Mr. Peter Bara, the witness of 

defendant,   has   admitted   in   his   cross   examination   that   letter 

Ex.PW1/15, Ex.PW1/16 and Mark­D have been received by his office. 

He also admitted that no reply was given to the letters submitted by the 

plaintiff   union.   The   legal   notice   was   also   served   in   the   office   of 

defendant no. 1, which was also not replied. He further admitted that 

the   plaintiff   union     had   filed   an   application   under   The   Right   to 

<a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_29">Information Act</a> Ex.PW1/13 which was replied by the department vide 

reply Ex.D1W1/P1. He further admitted that the defendant no. 2 had 

written a letter dated 28.04.2010 to defendant no. 1 asking about the 

status of plaintiff union. The defendant no. 1 replied to the letter dated 

28.04.2010 vide letter dated 30.04.2010 Ex.D1W1/P2. Thus, it is seen 

that the plaintiffs were not aware about the fact of cancellation of the 

registration of their union. When the plaintiffs came to know about the 

cancellation of their union, they immediately took steps to know about 

its status. They sent legal notice dated 01.05.2010 Ex.PW1/23 to the 

defendant no. 1. When the plaintiffs failed to get any response from 

defendant no. 1, they filed the suit in the court. The plaintiffs came to 

know about the cancellation of their trade union in the year 2010. The 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">CS No. 435/2010                                                       Page No. 28 of 30</span>
 suit has been filed on 11.05.2010 i.e. within 3 years from the date of 

knowledge of the cancellation. Thus, the suit filed by the plaintiffs is 

not barred by the limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_33">29.       The plaintiffs have succeeded to prove their case against the 

defendants beyond all probability. They have proved on record that no 

show cause notice was issued or an opportunity of hearing was given 

to them prior to the cancellation of their trade union. The defendant 

no. 1 acted in contravention of <a href="/doc/153148/" id="a_30">Section 10</a> of The Trade Unions Act in 

cancelling   the   registration   of   plaintiff   no.   1   without   any   sufficient 

reason. Defendant no. 4 has failed to discharge the onus to prove issue 

no. 3. The plaintiffs have succeeded in discharging the onus to prove 

issue no. 5 to 7. Accordingly, issue no. 3 is decided against defendant 

no. 4 and issue no. 5 to 7 are decided in favour of plaintiffs.
