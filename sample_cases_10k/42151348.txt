          ANTONY DOMINIC &amp; ALEXANDER THOMAS, JJ.
         ===============================
                      OP (RC) No. 49 of 2015
                    =================

             Dated this the 30th day of March, 2015

                            J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Antony Dominic, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      The respondents/landlords filed RCP No.56/06 against the

petitioner under Sections 11(3) and 11(4)(iv) of the Kerala Buildings

(Lease and Rent Control) Act. The Rent Control Court dismissed the

petition, however, the same was reversed in appeal. The tenant filed

RCR No.263/09 before this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      2.   The tenant had already initiated proceedings against the

landlord under the Kerala Land Reforms Act. During the pendency of

the RCR also, such proceedings under the Land Reforms Act were

pending.    RCR was finally disposed of by Ext.P4 order dated

14/1/2010 along with connected cases. In this order, the judgment

of the appellate authority in the Rent Control Appeal was confirmed.

However, taking note of the pendency of the proceedings under the

Land Reforms Act, this Court clarified that the eviction order which is

confirmed will be subject to the result of the proceedings which are

stated to be pending before the Land Tribunal.

OP(RC) No.49/15
                                : 2  :

<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">      3.   It is the case of the petitioner that subsequently, the

proceedings under the Land Reforms Act were decided against

her and that she challenged the order passed against her before

the appellate authority under the Land Reforms Act by filing AA

No.15/15. In that appeal, she also filed IA No.27/15. In that IA,

appellate authority passed Ext.P7 order granting stay of further

proceedings subsequent to the order impugned before him in the

suo motu proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      4.   Meanwhile, the landlord filed EP No.140/15 in RCP

No.56/06 on the file of the Munsiff Court, Thiruvananthapuram, a

copy of which is Ext.P8. According to the petitioner, she entered

appearance and contested the maintainability of the execution

petition. The petitioner contended that since this Court has

already clarified that eviction order will be subject to the result of

the proceedings under the Land Reforms Act and as A.A. No.15/15

is pending with an order of stay, the execution petition filed by

the landlord was not maintainable. It is stated that this contention

has been rejected by the execution court and delivery has been

ordered. This is the background in which the tenant has filed this

OP.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      5.   We heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

considered the submissions made.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      6.   Admittedly, the order of eviction passed in RCP

No.56/06, which was confirmed by this Court by dismissing RCR

No.263/09, has attained finality. In so far as the pendency of the

proceedings under the Kerala Land Reforms Act is concerned,

while passing Ext.P4 order, a Division had clarified the position

thus.
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">          "We clarify that the eviction order which is

          confirmed in RCP 56/06 (corresponding to RCR

          263/09) will be subject to the result of the

          proceedings which are stated to be pending

          before the Land Tribunal."</blockquote><p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">      7.   Reading of the above therefore shows that the Division

Bench has only ordered that the eviction order will be subject to

the result of the proceedings under the Land Reforms Act and the

Division Bench did not direct that until the finalisation of the

OP(RC) No.49/15

proceedings    under   the   Land   Reforms   Act,   the   eviction

proceedings pursuant to the order passed in the Rent Control

Petition should be kept in abeyance or will remain stayed. When a

Division Bench of this Court has ordered that eviction order will be

subject to the result of the proceedings under the Kerala Land

Reforms Act, that order does not operate as a stay of the

implementation of the order, but only means that ultimately if the

proceedings before the Land Tribunal are decided in favour of the

tenant, the tenant will be entitled to seek restitution. If that be

the purport of the clarification ordered by this Court in Ext.P4

order disposing of the RCR, the execution court cannot be faulted

for entertaining the execution petition during the pendency of

A.A.No.15/15 filed by the petitioner against the order passed by

the Land Tribunal rejecting the suo motu proceedings initiated at

the instance of the petitioner. We are therefore not in a position

to agree with the counsel.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      8.   The second payer in this OP is to direct the Principal

Munsiff's Court, Thiruvananthapuram to issue a copy of the order

OP(RC) No.49/15
                              :   5  :

<p id="p_13">

dated 25/3/15 passed in EP No.140/15 in RCP 56/06. Since the

order has been passed at the instance of the petitioner and since

she is aggrieved by that order, she is entitled to obtain a copy of

the said order to work out her remedies in accordance with law.

Therefore, we direct that, on the production of a copy of this

judgment, the Munsiff Court will issue a copy of the order,

provided the petitioner has applied for the same.
