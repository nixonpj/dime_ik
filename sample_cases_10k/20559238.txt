<blockquote id="blockquote_7">        3.         For brevity, <a href="/doc/1321824/" id="a_3">Section 129</a> of the Act is extracted under:-

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">             "129. Wearing of protective headgear.--Every person
             driving or riding (otherwise than in a side car, on a motor
             cycle of any class or description) shall, while in a public

             fit.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">             Explanation.--"Protective headgear" means a helmet
             which,--
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">             (a) by virtue of its shape, material and construction,
             could reasonably be expected to afford to the person

       hearing the learned counsel for the parties, writ court in WP(C)

       No.27865/15 passed the following order on 16 th September, 2015:-

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">             " xxx

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">             3.        Rule 347 A of the Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules as
             amended is in direct conflict with <a href="/doc/1321824/" id="a_4">Section 129</a> of the Motor
             Vehicles Act, 1988. The 'exceptions' made mention in the
             second proviso to <a href="/doc/1321824/" id="a_5">Section 129</a> of the Act concerns the
             applicability to persons who are sick or belonging to a
             particular community like 'Sikhs'. The main body of
             <a href="/doc/1321824/" id="a_6">Section 129</a> of the Act itself stipulates that every person

           driving or 'riding' a motor cycle shall wear a protective
           headgear.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">           4.        The State Government as early as in the year 2003
           undertook to enforce <a href="/doc/1321824/" id="a_7">Section 129</a> of the Act with all vigour.
           This is discernible from the Full Bench decision in
           <a href="/doc/1655569/" id="a_8">Narayanan Nair v. State of Kerala</a> (2003 (3) KLT 676).
           But the State Government by Ext.P1 notification has acted
           in contravention by inserting Rule 347A            in the Rules.
           Ext.P1 notification amending the Rules to the above effect
           is prima facie bad in law.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">           5.        The operation of Ext.P1 notification by which Rule
           347A was introduced in the Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules is
           hereby stayed until further orders."</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">

       and taking note of <a href="/doc/665535/" id="a_14">Article 254(2)</a> of the Constitution of India, there is
