:ORDER  
</pre><p id="p_1"> (Order of the Court was made by M.SATHYANARAYANAN,J.)      

        The writ petition is filed as a 'Public Interest Litigation' by a
resident of Kottaiyur, Maharajapuram (Via), Srivilliputhur Taluk,
Virudhunagar District, who said to have carried on agricultural oriental
business including selling paddy, dal, banana, coconut, etc., and he is also

first respondent had invited tender for granting licence to quarry rough
stone in Survey No.705/1 and 705/2 at Kottaiyur Village, Srivilliputhur,
Virudhunagar District, apart from inviting applications in respect of 11
other sites in Rajapalayam and Vembakottai Taluks.
</p>
<p id="p_2">        2. The learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn the attention of
this Court to the typed set and additional typed set and would submit that
even prior to the issuance of the impugned Notification, dated 24.02.2018,
objections were resisted as to the restarting of the stone quarry in the said
Survey Numbers and in this regard, meetings were also conducted by the 
residents of Kottaiyur Village and that apart, the Grama Sabha has also
passed a resolution and forward the same to the first respondent and without
properly considering their objections, sentiments, the respondents are
proceeding with the auction. It is the further submission of the learned
counsel for the petitioner that the tender process in respect of the said
survey numbers cannot go on, for the reasons enumerated in Paragraph No.3 of
the affidavit filed in support of this writ petition and it is relevant to
extract the same:
</p><p id="p_3">        (i) The proposed quarry site place nearest 50 Meter distance a 100
years old Pethanaswamy Temple is situated in Survey No.695. 
</p><p id="p_4">        (ii) There is a river bed viz., Settikuichi river bed, is there in
Survey No.695 within the distance of 250 meters to the proposed quarry site.
</p><p id="p_5">        (iii) Another Kadapillaiyarkulam Kanmai is there within 250 meters of
the proposed quarry site.
</p><p id="p_6">        (iv) The private coir company along functioning with 60 daily wages

</p><p id="p_7">        (v) From Mavoothu Tank to Kottaiyur Village Drinking Water Pipe line is
crossed over the proposed quarry site.
</p><p id="p_8">        (vi) There is the State Highways Road from Madurai to Watrap is crossed

</p><p id="p_9">        (vii) There are 7000 family members are residing Kottaiyur 2nd Grade

</p><p id="p_10">        (viii) There is another Reserve Forest is situated 10 KM away from the

Range. 
</p><p id="p_11">        (ix) There is a Grizzled Squirrel Wildlife sanctuary at Shenbaga
Thoppu, Srivilliputhur, within 20 kms.
</p><p id="p_12">        (x) There cannot be any quarry within the sanctuary limit 25
kilometers.
</p>        
<p id="p_13">        3. Attention of this Court has also been invited to the photographs and
vehement submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that in the
event of the permission being accorded to quarry rough stone, definitely
explosives would be used and it would definitely cause nuisance and air
pollution and it would also affect the water body and that apart, about 20
kms. away, a Grizzled Squirrel Wildlife Sanctuary at Shenbaga Thoppu is
located and within 10 kms., forests, comes under the jurisdiction of
Sathuragiri Forest Division and Sundarapandian Forest Range, are also located
and it will also lead to psychological and     environmental disaster and
therefore, prays for appropriate orders to quash the impugned Notification
insofar as the commencement of the quarrying operation in Survey No.705/1 and
2 of Kottaiyur Village, Srivilliputhur, Virudhunagar District.
</p>        
<p id="p_14">        4. The writ petition was listed for admission on 07.03.2018, and this
Court, after taking into consideration the submissions made by the learned
counsel for the petitioner, directed the learned Special Government Pleader,
who had accepted notice on behalf of the respondents 1 and 2 to get
instructions as to the latest position. Accordingly, the files relating to
the Notification have been produced before this Court and the learned Special
Government Pleader has also submitted a Letter dated 08.03.2018, in
Roc.No.KV1/811/2017, addressed by the Deputy Director of Geology and Mining,  
Virudhunagar to the learned Special Government Pleader. A perusal of the
files would disclose that the objections submitted by the petitioner and the
village people have been forwarded to the Srivilliputhur Revenue Thasildar
and the Revenue Tahsildar has caused an inspection of the site on 07.09.2017
and has submitted his report through his communication, dated 15.09.2017,

to Watrap Road and beyond 500 meters, water bodies are also situated and 
within the distance of 50 meters from the quarry site, there is no electric
line, water resources and no other permanent structures are there and to
reach the quarry site, access is also available and also indicated that in
the event of quarrying operation continuing,  the local residents would also
get employment and against which, made a false complaint. 
</p>        
<p id="p_16">        6. In response to the same, the learned counsel for the petitioner has
invited the attention of this Court to the additional typed set and would

the Scheduled Caste community in land in Survey No.859/2 of Ilanthaikulam
Village, Srivilliputhur Taluk, Virudhunagar District, has also located
closure to the water body and in the event of the superstructure being put up
by the said assignee also, they may be put to difficulty and hardship on
account of the running of the stone quarry and prays for appropriate orders

concerned.
