    for administration of the estate of the deceased  son of the plaintiff 

    No.1 and brother of the other plaintiffs.  The Suit   has been filed  for 




                                                                                         
    administration of his estate  on the ground of intestacy.

<p id="p_5">    3.        The  defendant produced  Will  of the  deceased  who is  her 

    deceased   husband.     The     marriage   of   the   defendant   and   the 




                                                                
    deceased   was   registered   under   the   <a href="/doc/4234/" id="a_1">Special   Marriage   Act</a>. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">    Consequent upon such registration, they would be governed  by the 




                                                   
    <a href="/doc/1450343/" id="a_2">Indian Succession  Act</a> for the purpose of succession, both intestate 
                                 
    or   testamentary.   Since   the   deceased   would   be   governed   by   the 

    <a href="/doc/1450343/" id="a_3">Indian Succession Act</a>,   he   would have no restrictions   on him to 
                                
    bequeath only 1/3 of his property    by a Will   as per   the Muslim 

    Personal  Law. He  was also not required to  obtain consent  of the 
           


    heirs to bequeath in excess of 1/3rd Property. He would be entitled 
        



    to   bequeath the entire of his   properties. It would, of course, be 

    required   to   be   proved   by     the   heirs   propounding   the   Will.   The 





    deceased, being a   Muslim     would not require to have   the Will 

    probated   under   the   <a href="/doc/1450343/" id="a_4">Indian   Succession   Act</a>    which     applied   to   his 

    succession.   Based on such facts in the suit of the plaintiff,  I came 





    to the prima facie conclusion that the marriage  being registered and 

    the   Will   being   produced     and   the   probate   of   the   Will     not   being 

    required,   the defendant would have to prove the Will   in the suit 

    itself.  The  onus would be on the defendant to prove  the Will.
</p>

<p id="p_7">    4.         Written statement was   filed.    The rejoinder of the plaintiff 

    made out a case of   forgery of the Will. I consequently framed the 




                                                                                        
    issues   which   are  similar   to   the   issues     which   are  framed     in  the 




                                                                
    testamentary   suits.   Since   the   relationship   between   the   parties   as 

    well as  properties of the  deceased were admitted,  the  defendant 

    had  the "right to begin" the evidence. 
</p>



                                                               
<p id="p_8">    5.        It appears that both the Advocates relied upon the Judgment 




                                                  
    of   Justice  Nishita  Mhatre,   reported   in  Sayeeda   Shakur     Khan   &amp;

    Review Petition has relied upon para 13 of the said Judgment, which 
        



    reads  thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                   "In my view, prima faice, it appears that a Muslim  





           who marries under the <a href="/doc/4234/" id="a_5">Special Marriage Act</a> is entitled to  
           bequeath   his   entire   property.   There   would   be   no  
           restriction on him to bequeath only 1/3   of his property  
           as   is   provided   under   the   Muslim   Personal   Law.  
           Moreover, such  a person  would  not have to obtain the  





           consent of the heirs  in order to  bequeath in  excess of  
           the legal third  of his property. However, once  a Muslim  
           who is married under the <a href="/doc/4234/" id="a_6">Special Marriage Act</a> is treated  
           on     par   with     persons   of   other   communities,   married  
           under the <a href="/doc/4234/" id="a_7">Special Marriage Act</a>,  all the rigours   of the

          appears to me that   a Will of such a Muslim who was  
          married under the <a href="/doc/4234/" id="a_9">Special Marriage Act</a> would  require to  




                                                                                    
          be probated."</blockquote>




                                                            
<p id="p_10">           Mr.     Ahmed     concedes   that     a   Muhammadan   who   marries

    property as observed in this paragraph.  He also  contends that the 

    other   observations   in   the   paragraph   would   also     apply   to   the 




                                              
    deceased's   Will. Those are that he would be treated on   par with 
                              
    persons of other communities, married under the <a href="/doc/4234/" id="a_11">Special Marriage 

    Act</a> and hence the rigours of the <a href="/doc/1450343/" id="a_12">Indian Succession Act</a>   applicable 
                             
    to such Wills would also apply to the deceased.   Mr. Ahmed has 

    argued   that    because this  judgment had not been considered by 
           


    me, an error in coming to the  conclusion   must be corrected.  Mr. 
        



    Pardiwalla contended that  his case does not fall within  the purview 

    of Review application under  Order 47  of  the Civil Procedure Code.

<p id="p_24">           Hence  <a href="/doc/1617988/" id="a_60">section  213</a>  of  the  Indian  Succession   Act  also    puts 
                              
    restrictions   upon     executors   and   legatees   of   certain   communities. 
</p>
<p id="p_25">    There  are no such restrictions upon Mohammedans.  Hence, if an 
          

    executor or a  legatee of a Hindu etc. seeks to execute a right under 

    a Will, even if not executed in  Mumbai ( or any other   metropolitan 
       



    cities)  or for properties not in Mumbai ( or any   other Metropolitan 

    cities) he would have the   restrictions upon him to probate the Will 





    he propounds.  There is  no restriction upon Wills of Mohammedans 

    under <a href="/doc/1617988/" id="a_61">Section 213</a> also. The exception under <a href="/doc/1617988/" id="a_62">Section 213</a> (2)   inter 





    alia upon Mohammedans gives  them a  facility  to propound a Will 

    which is  not probated.

    Court where  it is  relied upon itself.

    to apply for probate  under <a href="/doc/1617988/" id="a_65">Section 213(2)</a> of the Indian Succession
