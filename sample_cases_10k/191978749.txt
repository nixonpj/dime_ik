                                                            Writ Petition No.6347/2016




HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH, BENCH AT INDORE
                       Writ Petition No.6347/2016
                    (Smt. Soram Bai Vs. State of M. P. &amp; Others)
Indore, dt. 16/01/2018
      Mr. Prateek Patwardhan, learned counsel for the petitioner.
      Ms. Archana Kher, learned government advocate for the
respondent / State.</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner before this Court is a widow of Late Madanlal S/o
Gopal who was an employee serving the Public Works Department.
Late Madanlal during his lifetime has approached this Court and by an
order dated 17/12/2012 passed in Writ Petition 11361/2012, this Court
has directed the respondents to pass necessary orders in favour of
Madanlal as he was classified as permanent on 28/12/2009. The
respondents have not given financial benefits to Madanlal and now
Madanlal is no more and his widow is before this Court.
</p><p id="p_2">      Learned counsel for the petitioner has straightaway drawn
attention of this Court towards an order passed by the apex Court in
the case of Ram Naresh Rawat Vs. Ashwini Ray and Others reported
in (2017) 3 SCC 436. Paragraph No.25 to 27 of the aforesaid
judgment reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "25.    We may mention, at this stage that this aspect has come up
      for consideration, in another context, in <a href="/doc/80366871/" id="a_1">State of Madhya Pradesh and
      Others vs. Dilip Singh Patel and Others</a>[8]. That was a case where
      similarly situated employees, who were classified as 'permanent
      employees' under the <a href="/doc/1376794/" id="a_2">Standing Orders Act</a>, were given minimum of
      the pay-scale attached to their posts. However, after the
      implementation of Sixth Pay Commission, benefits thereof were not
      extended to these employees. High Court held that they would be
      entitled to have their pay fixed as per the revised scales in
      accordance with the recommendations of Sixth Pay Commission
      which were accepted qua regular employees. This Court, though,
      upheld the orders of the High Court giving them the benefit of revision
      of pay-scale pertained to Sixth Pay Commission, but at the same time
      made it clear that they would be entitled to minimum salary and
      allowances as per the said revised scales and would not be entitled to
      any increments. It was further held that such increments would be
      admissible only after regularisation of their services which
      regularisation was to take place as per the seniority list with due
      procedure. Following passage from the said judgment, which
      captures the aforesaid directions, is quoted hereunder:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                      "We have heard learned counsel for the parties
              and perused the records. It appears that the respondents
              earlier moved before the Administrative Tribunal, Gwalior
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          -2-</span>
                                                              Writ Petition No.6347/2016



              by filing original applications such as O.A. No. 648 of
              1995, O.A. No. 293 of 1991 etc. In compliance of the
              orders passed in such original applications, the Chief
              Engineer, Yamuna Kachhar, Water Resources
              Department, Gwalior (M.P.)( by orders issued in between
              April,. 2004 and June, 2004 provided the mi8nimum
              wages and allowances to the respondents without
              increment as per the Schedule of the pay scale from the
              date of the order of the Tribunal. It was further ordered
              that the regularization of the daily wages employees shall
              be made as per the seniority list with due procedure and
              the benefit of increment and other benefits can only be
              granted after the regularisation as per the Rules. It was
              ordered that the order of the Court for benefit of minimum
              wages and allowances shall be .............
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                       From the aforesaid facts, it is clear that the
              respondents are entitled for minimum wages and
              allowance as per the fixed Schedule of the pay scale but
              without any increment. In such case, if the pay scale is
              revised from time to time including the pay-scale as
              revised pursuant to Sixth Pay Commission, the
              respondents will be entitled to minimum wages and
              allowance as per the said revised scale without
              increment. Only after regularisation of their service, as
              per seniority and rules, they can claim the benefit of
              increment and other benefits."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      26.     From the aforesaid, it follows that though a 'permanent
      employee' has right to receive pay in the graded pay-scale, at the
      same time, he would be getting only minimum of the said pay-scale
      with no increments. It is only the regularisation in service which would
      entail grant of increments etc. in the pay-scale.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      27.     In view of the aforesaid, we do not find any substance in the
      contentions raised by the petitioners in these contempt petitions. We
      are conscious of the fact that in some cases, on earlier occasions, the
      State Government while fixing the pay scale, granted increments as
      well. However, if some persons are given the benefit wrongly, that
      cannot form the basis of claiming the same relief. It is trite that right to
      equality under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_3">Article 14</a> is not in negative terms (See Indian Council
      of Agricultural Research &amp; Anr. v. T.K. Suryanarayan &amp; Ors. reported
      in (1997) 6 SCC 766."</blockquote>

<p id="p_3">      The aforesaid order makes it very clear that an employee who
has been classified as permanent, shall be entitled for minimum of pay
scale with no increments.
</p><p id="p_4">      Resultantly, after hearing learned counsel for the petitioner as
well as learned government advocate, present writ petition stands
allowed and the respondents are directed to release all financial
benefits to the widow of which Late Madanlal was entitled, meaning
thereby, to grant minimum of the pay-scale from the date the Madanlal
was classified i.e. w.e.f. 04/02/2002 as he was classified as permanent

on account of order passed by the Labour Court in Case
No.107/MPIR/02 decided on 04/11/2004. The exercise of granting
monetary benefits be concluded within a period of three months from
the date of receipt of certified copy of this order, failing which the
respondents shall pay interest @ 12% per annum from the date the
amount become due till it is actually paid to the widow.

        Certified Copy as per rules.
