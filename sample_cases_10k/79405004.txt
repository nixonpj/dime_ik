                                JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">Barkath Ali, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      Appellants are the claimants in O.P.(MV)No.1596/2002 on the

file of Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Alappuzha. They are the

widow and two minor children of deceased Satheesan Pillai, who died

in a motor accident. In this appeal, they challenge the judgment and

award of the Tribunal dated December 11, 2008 awarding a

compensation of Rs. 3,50,000/- for the loss caused to them on account

of the death of deceased in the accident.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      2.    The accident happened on July 13, 2002 at about 5.15 p.m..

While deceased Satheesan Pillai was cycling along Aroor-Arookutty

road and reached near Aroor temple junction, he was knocked down by

the mini lorry bearing Reg.No.KL-4/G 5382 driven by the first

respondent. Satheesan Pillai sustained serious injuries and he died on

the way to the hospital. Alleging negligence against the first

respondent, the driver of the mini lorry, the claimants filed the O.P.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">MACA.No.3200/2009                   2</span>

before the Tribunal claiming a compensation of Rs. 9,62,000/-. The

mother of deceased Satheesan Pillai was shown as fourth respondent.

</p><p id="p_4">      3.     Respondents 1 and 2, the driver and the owner of the

offending mini lorry and fourth respondent remained absent before the

Tribunal. The third respondent, the insurer of the offending mini lorry

filed a written statement admitting the policy.

</p><p id="p_5">      4.     PW1 was examined and Exts.A1 to A7 were marked on the

side of the claimants before the Tribunal. No evidence was adduced by

the contesting third respondent. On an appreciation of evidence, the

Tribunal found that the accident occurred due to the negligence of the

first respondent and awarded a compensation of Rs. 3,50,000/- with

interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of petition till realisation and

a cost of Rs. 3,500/-. The claimants have now come up in appeal

challenging the quantum of compensation awarded by the Tribunal.

</p><p id="p_6">      5.     Heard counsel for the appellants/claimants and the counsel

for the Insurance Company.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       6.     The accident is not disputed. The finding of the Tribunal

that the accident occurred due to the negligence on the part of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">MACA.No.3200/2009                   3</span>

driver of the mini lorry is not challenged in this appeal. Therefore the

only question which arises for consideration is whether the claimants

are entitled to any enhanced compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_8">        7. The      Tribunal   awarded    a   total  compensation     of

Rs.3,50,000/-. The break up of the compensation amount awarded is as

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">     Compensation for pecuniary loss caused to
     to the petitioners due to the death of Satheesan
     Pillai                                          - Rs. 3,20,000/-
</blockquote><pre id="pre_2">     Loss of love and affection                      - Rs. 10,000/-
     Loss of consortium                              - Rs. 10,000/-
     Pain and suffering                              - Rs.   5,000/-
     Ambulance charge                                - Rs.   2,000/-
     Funeral expenses                                - Rs.   3,000/-


</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       8.    The Counsel for the claimants sought enhancement of the

compensation for loss of dependency, for loss of love and affection

and for loss of consortium.</blockquote><p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">     9.      The Tribunal took the monthly income of the deceased as

Rs.2,500/- which works out to Rs. 30,000/- per annum. After deducting

1/3 for his personal expenses, the balance amount of Rs. 20,000/- was

taken as his annual contribution to his family. The Tribunal adopted a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">MACA.No.3200/2009                  4</span>

multiplier of 16 and awarded Rs. 3,20,000/- for the loss of dependency.

According to the claimants, deceased was working as a Welder in

M/s. Aswathy Spun Pipes and he was drawing a salary of Rs.4,200/-.

Ext.A7 is the certificate to that effect. PW1 is the employer of the

deceased. He has also stated that by doing instalLation work of

concrete septic tanks, the deceased used to get amounts. Taking into

consideration all these aspects, we feel that the monthly income of the

deceased can be reasonably fixed at Rs. 3,500/- which comes to      Rs.

42,000/- per annum. After deducting 1/3 for his personal expenses, the

balance amount of Rs. 28,000/- can be taken as his annual contribution

to his family.   The Tribunal adopted a multiplier of 16 which is not

seriously challenged. Thus calculated for the loss of dependency, the

claimants are entitled to a compensation of    Rs. 4,48,000/- ( 28,000 x

</p><p id="p_11">16). Thus on this count, the claimants are entitled to an additional

compensation of Rs.1,28,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      10.   The Tribunal awarded Rs. 10,000/- for loss of consortium

which appears to be very low. Taking into consideration the age of the

deceased as well as the first claimant widow,           we feel that a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">MACA.No.3200/2009                   5</span>

compensation of Rs. 15,000/- would be reasonable on this count.

</p><p id="p_13">      11.   For loss of love and affection, Rs. 10,000/- was awarded by

the Tribunal which appears to be quite inadequate. Having regard to

the age of the minor children and the widow, we feel that a

compensation of Rs. 25,000/- would be reasonable on this count.

</p><p id="p_14">      12.   In the result, the claimants are found entitled to an

additional compensation of Rs. 1,48,000/-. They are entitled to interest

@ 7.5% per annum from the date of petition till realisation and

proportionate cost.   The third respondent being the insurer of the

offending vehicle shall deposit the amount before the Tribunal within

two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. The

award of the Tribunal is modified to the above extent.

</p><p id="p_15">      The Appeal is disposed of as found above.
</p>
<p id="p_16">
