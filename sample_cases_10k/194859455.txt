                      suit in O.S.No.508 of 2017 before the learned District Judge, Coimbatore for

                      recovery of money due under the Promissory Notes, dated 27.02.2014 and

                      10.11.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_3">


</p><p id="p_4">                              3. The cause of action for the suit arose on 27.02.2014 and 10.11.2014,

                      when the appellant/defendant herein executed a Promissory Note in favour of

                      the respondent/plaintiff for Rs.4,00,000/- and for Rs.2,50,000/- respectively

                      after   receiving    valid        consideration       therefor.     On    20.05.2015,   the

                      appellant/defendant executed a letter in favour of the respondent/plaintiff

                      acknowledging his liability to the amount due under the promissory notes. on

                      all subsequent dates, when the appellant/defendant failed to make payment

                      due under the said Promissory Notes and on 27.03.2017, the defendant issued a

                      Cheque for Rs.8,00,000/- in favour of the plaintiff for discharging the part of

                      the legally enforceable debt payable to the plaintiff but the cheque was

                      returned    for     lack     of     sufficient       funds   in   the    account   of   the

                      appellant/defendant.          On 28.03.2017, the respondent/plaintiff issued a

                      Lawyer's Notice, calling upon the defendant to make payment due under the

                      said dis-honoured Cheque. On all subsequent dates, the appellant/defendant

                      was making hectic and clandestine attempts to alienate his only available

                      property and leave the jurisdiction of this Court and thus, refusing to make

                      payment due under the Promissory notes at Kurichi Village Coimbatore, where

                      the said Promissory Notes are executed, within the jurisdiction of this Court.

                      Hence the respondent/plaintiff prayed for recovery of money.




</p><p id="p_5">                            4. During the pendency of the suit, the respondent/plaintiff filed an

                      Interlocutory application in I.A.No.1396 of 2017 in O.S.No.508 of 2017 before

                      the trial Court to furnish security for the suit claim of Rs.15,00,000/-. Hence,

                      the trial Court issued 6-A notice to the appellant/defendant to furnish

                      security.
</p>
<p id="p_6">


</p><p id="p_7">                            5. Pursuant to that the appellant/defendant produced the security bond

                      with xerox copy of the partition Deed by way of complying the order. But the

                      respondent/plaintiff filed a memo of objection due to non production of

                      original partition Deed dated 07.02.2013. Further the security bond furnished

                      by way of affidavit will not be reflected in the Encumbrance Certificate.




</p><p id="p_8">                            6. Per contra, the appellant/defendant filed a counter stating that the

                      schedule mention property has already been mortgaged with Repco Bank for

                      the loan amount of Rs.1,50,000/- on 20.03.2015.       But he has not repay the

                      loan due to his business loss.
</p>
<p id="p_9">


</p><p id="p_10">                            7. After several hearings, on 21.02.2018, the trial Court has ordered for

                      attachment by returning the counter filed by the appellant/defendant since

                      the partition Deed which is in custody of the defendant would cause

                      encumbrance.
</p>
<p id="p_11">


</p><p id="p_12">                            8. Aggrieved against the attachment of property ordered by the trial

                      Court, the appellant/defendant is before this Court.




</p><p id="p_13">                            9. The learned counsel for appellant would submit that he has given an

                      undertaking that he would not alienate the property which was sought to be

                      attached by the respondent herein. The learned counsel would further submit

                      that the value of the attached property is 3 Crores which is 20 times more than

                      the suit claim. But the trial Court has not considered the above facts, simply

                      ordered for attachment which needs interference of this Court.




</p><p id="p_14">                            10. Heard the learned counsel appearing on either side and perused the

                      materials available on record.
</p>
<p id="p_15">


</p><p id="p_16">                            11. On a perusal of records, it is seen that the appellant has filed an

                      affidavit dated 07.02.2013 as security bond towards the property which was

                      sought to be attached and also undertakes that he would not alienate the

                      property. Therefore, in the interest of justice, this Court is inclined to pass

                      the following order:

                      Additional District Judge, Coimbatore.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                            ii) The learned III Additional District Judge, Coimbatore is directed to

                      dispose of the suit made in O.S.No.508 of 2017 in accordance with law within a

                      period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.

</p><p id="p_19">                            iii) Though the property mentioned in the petition seeking furnish

                      security was already mortgaged with the Repco Bank, and hence it is between

                      the appellant and the respondent who is the plaintiff in the suit may file any

                      proof of property for the application for seeking furnish security for

                      attachment can be considered afresh by the learned Judge if it is warrant.
