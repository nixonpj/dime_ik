            Dated this the 27th day of June, 2018


                              JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     This writ petition is filed by the petitioner seeking

direction to the 2nd respondent to issue a certificate of

declaration that the petitioner is having deemed D&amp;O licence to

operate the quarry for the period 2018-19 within a reasonable

time, and for other related reliefs.         Material facts for the

disposal of the writ petition are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_2">     2.     Petitioner is an operator of a quarry in the property

comprised     in     Survey    Nos.53/2,     53/3   and    53/4   of

Thachanattukara-2        Village   and     Survey   No.390/1-A    of

Thachanattukara-1 Village of Mannarkadu Taluk, Palakkad

District. According to the petitioner, petitioner is operating the

quarry after securing licence/permission/consent from the

respective statutory authorities. Exts.P1 to P3 are D&amp;O licence

issued by the 2nd respondent on 04.04.2016, 28.07.2016 and

14.07.2016.        During the validity of Exts.P1 to P3 licence,

petitioner was compelled to stop the operation of quarry for

want of environmental clearance.         Thereafter, petitioner has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C) No.16333 of 2018           2</span>

obtained the environmental clearance as per Ext.P4 dated

31.01.2018, and Ext.P5 consent is issued by the Kerala State

Pollution Control Board on 22.02.2018.       Petitioner has also

secured Ext.P6 explosive licence and Ext.P7 letter of intent

dated 02.08.2017 issued by the Director of Mining and

Geology.     In accordance with the directions contained in

Ext.P7, petitioner has to produce certain documents for

obtaining the quarry lease, which includes D&amp;O licence from

the 1st respondent.     Thereupon, petitioner has submitted 4

applications dated 27.02.2018 before the 1 st respondent, to

which, the 2nd respondent has issued Exts.P8 to P11 receipts.

According to the petitioner, the copy of the application for

licence was not retained by the petitioner.        Even though

petitioner tried his level best to secure the D&amp;O licence issued,

the respondents are taking a hesitant attitude to issue the

same, and it is thus constrained with the said circumstances,

petitioner has filed this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3.    Second respondent has filed a detailed counter

affidavit. Among other contentions, it is stated that, petitioner

had brought an application to the 1st respondent Panchayat,

seeking D&amp;O licence for the year 2018-19.        However, large
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C) No.16333 of 2018         3</span>

number of locals have objected to granting D&amp;O licence for the

petitioner to operate the quarry. The objection raised was that

due to the operation of the quarry, the structure of their

buildings are getting damaged and huge cracks are developed

on the walls. That apart, large amount of dust from the quarry

is disturbing the normal life of the people of the locality, and

thereby they are infected with serious allergies.          Other

objections are also raised by the people residing in the locality

like, children going to school are facing difficulties etc. etc.

Thereupon,   the   Panchayat   Committee,    as   per   Ext.R2(a)

resolution dated 07.03.2018 decided to hear the objections

and a notice dated 03.05.2018 was issued to the petitioner,

evident from Ext.R2(b).        The hearing was held by the

Panchayat Committee headed by the President on 09.05.2018,

and after hearing both sides, it was decided by the committee

of the Panchayat to reject the application for D&amp;O licence

sought for by the petitioner, evident from Ext.R2(c).        The

decision of the Panchayat committee dated 22.05.2018 is

produced as Ext.R2(d). According to the 2 nd respondent, the

rejection of the application was informed to the petitioner as

per Ext.R2(e) letter dated 23.05.2018. Therefore, according to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C) No.16333 of 2018           4</span>

the respondents, petitioner is not entitled to get the reliefs

sought for in the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     4.    I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner and

the learned counsel appearing for the respondent Panchayat.

Perused the documents on record and the pleadings put forth

by the respective parties.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     5.    The tenor and terms of the pleadings put forth by

the petitioner and the legal circumstances pointed out make it

clear that, petitioner is seeking the relief on the basis of

deemed licence accrued as per sub-section (3) of Sec.236 of

the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994, which stipulates as

follows:
