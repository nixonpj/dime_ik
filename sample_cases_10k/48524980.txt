</p><p id="p_65">XXXXX by Mr. K. Kaushik, Ld. Counsel for the accused.
On S.A.
</p><p id="p_66">       The alleged money which was given as a loan to the accused was arranged from some
relative and some money from my father in his possession. My father arranged the money from
Ram Tej Gupta both are my maternal uncle (one is Mama and one is uncle). Exact date I do not
remember when the money I taken from them. I do not remember the date when my father
requested my mama and uncle for arranging the money. My mama and uncle did not got
executed any receipt from my father when they gave money. Rs.50,000/- was taken from my
mama and Rs.65,000/- was taken from my uncle. The deal was took place in my presence but I
do not remember the remuneration of currency notes as it is an old deal. I also do not remember
the date when the loan was advanced to Ramji Gupta and I also do not remember the
remuneration of currency notes. My father did not got any receipt from Ramji Gupta. (Vol. As it
was a friendly loan). My father also advanced friendly loan to other persons also but I do not
remember their names but they were in my relations. My father did not run any committee. It is
correct that my father did not mention the giving of Rs.1.75 lacs in cash book or in final account,
balance sheet or in income tax return for the year 2005-2006 and 2006-2007. It is wrong to
suggest that my father used to organize committee and in January 2004 and my father started a
committee of Rs.1 lac of installment of Rs.5,000/- per month of 20 members and another
committee was of Rs.50,000/- of installment of Rs.2,500/- per month of 20 members or accused
Ramji Gupta was also one of the members at the time when my father started these committees
received two cheques bearing No.350073 and 350072 and both were blank and were only signed
by Ramji Gupta. I do not know who filled the cheques including name of my father money in
 word and in digit. (Vol. Accused brought the filled up cheques). I do not know whether cheques
were in the hand of Ramji Gupta or not. It is wrong to suggest that my father misused both the
cheques by filling them as Rs.90,000/- and Rs.85,000/- in his name and presented the same in the
bank to extract money from accused. It is wrong to suggest that I am deposing falsely and I am
deliberately not telling the fact that my father was maintaining a diary which contained the names
of committee holders and in that my father also mentioned the monthly installments against the
names of every members. It is further wrong to suggest that my father never took any loan from
my Mama and uncle and no loan was advanced to the accused Ramji Gupta.</p><pre id="pre_9">

</p><p id="p_79">       I sent a legal demand notice through my counsel on 22.12.2006 to the accused. It is
correct that in my legal notice dated 22.12.2006 it is mentioned that accused had taken Rs.
40,000/- from me on 10.08.2006 while in other legal demand notice dated 25.09.2006 it is

and dated 10.03.2006 of both the legal demand notices were mentioned as it is in my affidavit
and complaint. I do not remember the exact date of receiving the first cheque in question from
the accused. I do not remember the number of the first cheque. I do not remember the amount of
the first cheque. (Vol. I received two cheques at one time and another third cheque received
thereafter from the accused). I do not remember when I presented the first cheque in question in

the amount of first cheque is Rs.50,000/-, second cheque is Rs.60,000/- and the third cheque is
Rs.1 lac). It is correct that I have not filed any receipt of Rs.2 lacs on record of the present case
which was mentioned in my cross-examination dated 13.08.2012 conducted in CC No.595/11. I
do not remember whether fact of receipt of Rs.2 lacs was mentioned in my legal demand notice
or not. The same answer is for the complaint and affidavit that I have not mentioned the fact of
receipt Mark-A. It is wrong to suggest that the cheque was blank except signature. It is wrong to
suggest that the cheque in question was given for the purpose of security. It is correct that only
one cheque bearing No.465428 is mentioned in the receipt Mark-A. No other cheque's liability is
mentioned in this receipt Mark-A. (Vol. The receipt Mark-A is written in the handwriting of the
 accused Brij Bhushan). It is correct that the same kind of receipt Exh.DW1/2 dated 13.04.2006 is
executed between me and Prem Bahadur in the case Nand Lal Dogra Vs. Prem Bahadur. It is
correct that the accused is having three sons. I do not remember whether I have mentioned this
loan amount in my Income Tax Return or not. It is correct that I do not have any licence to give
any loan to anybody. It is wrong to suggest that I have given loan to more than ten persons. It is
wrong to suggest that I have given loan to more than five persons. It is correct that there was no
written demand from my side for the alleged loan except the legal demand notice. It is correct
that I have not filed any account statement or any paper where I can show that I gave Rs.1 lac to
the accused. I did not file any alleged receipt in any of the case where I can prove that a loan of
Rs.2 lacs was given to the accused. It is wrong to suggest that the cheques in question were filled
in by me. It is wrong to suggest that loan no amount was due on the accused. It is wrong to
suggest that no legal demand notice was served to the accused. It is wrong to suggest that the
security cheque has been filled in by me with a view to misuse the cheques. It is wrong to suggest
that the accused asked me to return of blank security cheques but I refused to return the same on
the ground that same have been misplaced from the office. It is wrong to suggest that I was
introduced by the loan provider of different banks to accused. It is correct that accused had taken
the loan from me from time to time and thereafter. It is wrong to suggest that accused executed a
written document as per the direction of the complainant. It is wrong to suggest that a loan with
interest was already paid to me in December 2003. It is wrong to suggest that I have filed forged,
manipulated document alongwith affidavit. It is wrong to suggest that I am deposing falsely.

 Jagdish Bharti       Vs.    Madan Lal
CC No.6112/11

</pre><p id="p_113">Statement of Mr. Jagdish Bharti, Complainant (recalled for cross-examination on an
application U/s 145(2) <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_42">NI Act</a>).
</p><p id="p_114">XXXXX by Mr. Harbir Singh Sylonia, Ld. Counsel for the accused.
On S.A.
</p><p id="p_115">       I have read over all the complainant evidence. I have given list of witnesses but I can give
any more. I did not hand over any documents to the accused regarding the bus bearing
No.DL1PB 4702. I have given possession letter to the accused. I have not filed any receipt of
possession on record. The deal of bus was done for a sum of Rs.7 lacs with the accused. This
bargaining has been done with one Mr. Bhavinder Kumar, Electrician who is the maternal uncle
of the accused. I am not related to the accused anyhow. The bus was financed by Delhi Finance
Corporation. The accused gave me Rs.10,000/- as advance against purchasing of bus and apart
from this payment, accused gave me Rs.2,60,000/- as part payment in installments. I did not file
a letter on dated 01.06.2011. I have already told the hon'ble court that I have received Rs.
2,70,000/- from the accused. Since May 2008, the bus was in police custody. I had not taken any
undertaking from the accused regarding the balance payment since the bus was in police custody
and was financed by DFC the accused approached me that I am ready to purchase the bus on the
basis of as is where is and I will manage to obtain all the documents and I will get it repair at my
own cost. I sold the bus being in the police custody but handed over the bus after getting it
released from the police custody. I did not get the photographs when it was in police custody and
when it was handed over to the accused. I did not file any photograph of the bus on record. The
bus is worth to ply on the road. The accused did not give any time of the payment to the
complainant in blank and white but issued a post dated cheque. The accused assured me to pay
the entire amount before 30th May 2011. Prior to this date, accused Sh. Madan Lal gave many
assurances to make the payment but failed. I do not remember the date of any assurance given by
 the accused to me. I filed the present complaint in Tis Hazari Court because the cheque issued by
the accused was payable in the jurisdiction of IP Estate. The amount of the cheque is filled in by
me. The amount was written by the complainant in the presence of accused. There was no
witness at the time of writing the amount on the cheque except the accused. The complainant
wrote the cheque himself in the first week of May 2011 at the residence of accused in the
presence of wife of accused and his mother. I did not try to call any witness at that time because
there was no witness. I do not remember the number of cheques. I did not give any notice to the
accused through my advocate. I sent a legal demand notice through registered post and courier
also. I also sent a written letter demanding the cheque money by courier from the accused.
Neither I called on mobile nor from telephonic message to the accused. Accused cheated me.
This is a breach of trust by the accused. I wrote a letter to the Chief Minister of Delhi, DCP of
Traffic Police and Chairman, DTC regarding this cheating and misusing of my bus which was
plying on school routs without any valid documents like permit, fitness, insurance etc. by the
accused after filing the present complaint case against the accused. I wrote these letters to the
above said authorities because plying such vehicles on road without valid documents is a crime
and it can cause heavy losses to the public like lethal accidents and the responsibility goes to
registered owner. I have no proof of handing over the bus to the accused. The Bus bearing
No.DL1PB 4702 is in the custody of the accused. It is wrong to suggest that the bus is in my
custody. The affidavit and the main complaint is signed by me and not by my advocate but it
might be counter signed by my advocate. I have given NOC from DFC to the accused regarding
the bus in question. I have not filed NOC from DFC on record. It is wrong to suggest that I have
not given the NOC from DFC to the accused. I did not give any documents of transfer by the
authority. Nor I gave any NOC to the accused from STA because in the deal as is where is it is
not required. I do not remember that there is any difference between complaint and affidavit. I am
a diabetic and heart patient and my bus was in custody of the police, I decided to dispose of the
bus. The accused contacted me with his maternal uncle but it was financed by DFC and a huge
liability was lying upon me. The accused shows his interest to purchase my bus in the possession
as is where is. I had faith on the accused due to the assurance given by the accused that shortly he
 will get the compensation of his brother's death who died in Uphar Agnikand and the bus was in
my own name. I did not make any signature on the sale letter i.e. Form No.31. I have not
received any receipt regarding Form No.31. I did not give any documents regarding fitness, road
tax, insurance, RC etc. I have given the HP letter to the accused personally and by post and
courier also but I did not file the same on record. The bus was not transfered by the complainant.
I cannot tell the position of the bus since it is still in the possession of accused. It is wrong to
suggest that I am deposing falsely.</p><pre id="pre_15">
