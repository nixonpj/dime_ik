PRAYING THAT THIS HON`BLE COURT MAY BE PLEASED

No.93/2012      OF    KYATHASANDRA      POLICE   STATION,
TUMKUR, FOR THE OFFENCES PUNISHABLE UNDER
                           -2-

SECTIONS 120(B), 143, 147, 148, 364, 302 READ WITH
SECTION 149 OF INDIAN PENAL CODE.


     THIS CRIMINAL PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:



                      ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">     The present petitioner is arraigned as accused

No.9 in a pending case alleging offences punishable

under Sections 120(B), 143, 147, 148, 364, 302 read

with <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_1">Section 149</a> of the Indian Penal Code. It is alleged

that on 10.03.2012, one Ajay Kumar, was riding his

motor cycle and at about 1:15 p.m. while travelling near

APMC Yard within the limits of Kyathasandra Police

Station and when he was near Devarayapatna Cuve, it

is alleged that this petitioner, Accused No.9, came in a

Tata Sumo vehicle and caused an accident.           The

deceased, who was on the motor cycle fell down on

being struck by the vehicle driven by the present

petitioner and all the accused had then assaulted Ajay
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            -3-</span>

Kumar with deadly weapons and had thrown his body

nearby.   This incident having been said to have been

witnessed by CWs.2 and 4, who allegedly have later

identified the present petitioner in the Police Station

after they were apprehended on the voluntary statement

of accused No.1. It is also on record that several of the

accused having approached this Court seeking bail have

been enlarged on bail. The present petitioner had also

approached the Court below seeking bail on parity,

which has been rejected while noticing that the acts

attributed to the petitioner are serious and since the

case is one of murder, the petitioner did not deserve to

be enlarged on bail.
</p>
<p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">     2.    Though the order of the Court below does

not refer to the eye witness accounts of CWs.2 and 3,

the learned Government Pleader would emphasize that

the present petitioner has been seen at the spot and he

was the driver of the vehicle, which dashed in to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                 -4-</span>

vehicle ridden by the deceased and therefore, he was

squarely        implicated.    The    manner   in   which   the

petitioner is said to have been identified is difficult to

accept         and there was no test identification parade

either, in the prosecution seeking to conclude that the

petitioner, indeed, was the driver of the vehicle, which

had dashed into the vehicle of the deceased.            These

circumstances would have to be established at the trial.

Since most of the accused have been enlarged on bail, it

would be consistent to hold that the petitioner is

entitled to such bail on parity.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">     The petition is allowed.          The Petitioner shall be

enlarged on bail on the following conditions:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">         (i)      The petitioner shall execute a personal
                  bond for a sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees
                  Fifty thousand) with a solvent surety for a
                  likesum to the satisfaction of the concerned
                  Court.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">         (ii)     The petitioner shall not directly or
                  indirectly seek to influence the prosecution
                  witnesses.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                            -5-</span>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (iii)   He shall appear before the Investigation
              officer as and when required and shall co-
              operate with the Investigating Officer.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      (iv)    The petitioner     shall   attend   the   Court
              regularly.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      (v)     In case of violation of any of these
              conditions, the Court is at liberty to pass
              suitable orders.
</blockquote>
