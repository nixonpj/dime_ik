<p id="p_1">Ramachandra Menon, J:
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">      Whether the rights and liabilities arising out of a contract

are to be adjudged on the basis of the express terms of the

contract as pursued by the court below or on the basis of the

deemed circumstances as pursued by the Arbitral Tribunal, is

the crucial issue involved herein. Reliance is also placed by

either side, on the decision rendered by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/919241/" id="a_1">Oil

&amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. vs. SAW Pipes Ltd</a>.[AIR

2003 SC 2629].
</p>
<p id="p_4">      2. With regard to the sequence of events, the appellant

was awarded the work of upgradation of the State Highway

from Muvattupuzha-Thodupuzha and Muvattupuzha-Angamali.

After completing all the formalities, the work was being

pursued. During the course of execution of the work, disputes

arose between the parties; which, by virtue of clause 67.4 of

the General conditions of Contract (GCC) forming part of the

Arbitration Agreement, had to be settled in Arbitration. The

appellant raised three claims viz.,

ARBITRATION APPEAL NO. 32 OF 2007

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>

</p><p id="p_5">      (i) payment of interest at the prevailing market rates upon

unpaid sums/belated payments

</p><p id="p_6">      (ii) Payment of cost of land purchased for Engineers' office

accommodation and transferred to the respondent by regd:

conveyance and

</p><p id="p_7">      (iii) issuance of Excise Duty exemption certificates for HSD

(High speed Diesel), Lubricants, Tyres etc. and for reimbursement

for non-issuance of such certificates.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      3.    With regard to the 1st claim, as per the terms of the

contract, the    payment had to       be effected in the course of

execution of the work on the basis of the <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a> (Interim Payment

Certificate) within 42 days of preferring the claim. It was stipulated

in the terms of the agreement that, in the event of failure of the

employer to make payment within the time stated, the employer

shall pay to the contractor interest compounded monthly at the

rates stated in 'Appendix to Bid' upon sums unpaid from the date

upon which the same should have been paid, in the currencies in

which the payments are due.         It was also stipulated in the

agreement that the payments to an extent of 24% had to be

effected in 'Foreign currency' and 76% in 'Local currency'. The said

claim, more particularly involving `Local currency' was resisted

ARBITRATION APPEAL NO. 32 OF 2007

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                     3</span>

from the part of the respondent/State, stating that no rate was

shown in the `Appendix to Bid' and as such, by virtue of the specific

clause and the "instructions to the bidders" issued in this regard, no

interest was liable to be paid under any circumstances. "Appendix

to Bid" (a copy of which was placed before this Court for perusal)

shows that in respect of Column with regard to the payment of

`Foreign currency', the rate of interest was quoted as "LIBOR

(London Inter Bank on lending Rate)+ 2%", whereas in respect of

Column for the `Local currency', the rate was left blank. The case

of the appellant is that it was only an omission, intending to have it

claimed later in the due course and that it could never be deemed

as waived.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      4. The second claim was in respect of non-payment of cost

of the land procured by the appellant for providing office

accommodation to the Engineers in connection with the work.

However, in view of subsequent turn of events, answering the said

issue in favour of the appellant and further since no challenge has

been raised by the respondent/State in respect of the finding

rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal, it has become final and this issue

does not form the subject matter of the present Appeal.

</p><p id="p_10">      5. The third claim put up by the appellant was that, by virtue

ARBITRATION APPEAL NO. 32 OF 2007

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4</span>

of the notification bearing No. 108/95-CE dated 28.08.1995, the

appellant was entitled for the benefit of exemption from Excise

Duty in respect of the "goods required for the project" and that

denial of issuance of necessary certificate in respect of HSD,

Lubricants, Tyres etc.,  that too,  after allowing the claim for

exemption in respect of Cement, Steel, Bitumen etc, has resulted

in much loss and hardships; which in turn was sought to be

compensated by way of reimbursement.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      6.    Since the claims put up by the appellant were not

positively considered, the matter was taken up before the `Dispute

Review Board'    (DRB) for the first time, as provided in the

Arbitration Agreement. It is the case of the appellant that, though

the DRB had made necessary recommendation on 02.04.2004, the

same was not complied with, from the part of the respondent,

which led to arbitration before the Arbitral Tribunal consisting of

three members. The Arbitral Tribunal passed an award in favour of

the appellant by a majority decision allowing all the three claims;

aggrieved of which, the respondent/State preferred the O.P.

(Arbitration) before the Court below. After appreciating the facts

and circumstances, the 'second claim' with regard to the cost/

compensation for the land was sustained by the Arbitration Court,

ARBITRATION APPEAL NO. 32 OF 2007

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     5</span>

whereas the findings and reasoning given by the Arbitral Tribunal

on the 'first' and 'third' claims were set aside, which has led to the

present Appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      7. With regard to the 'first claim', on interest, the contention

put forth by the appellant is mainly that non-showing of rate of

interest in the 'Appendix to Bid' is not fatal, so as to deny the

claim. Reliance is placed on the decision rendered by the Apex

Court in Secretary, Irrigation Department, Government of

Orissa and others Vs. G.C. Roy [1992 (1) SCC 508 (at 532)]

as well. The said contention is sought to be resisted from the part

of the respondent stating that the terms of the Bid are very much

clear as specified under clause 60.8(b) of the Conditions of

Particular    Application (COPA in short), which, as extracted in

paragraph 13 of the impugned order, reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "In the event of the failure of the employer to

             make payment within the times stated, the

             Employer shall pay to the contractor interest

             compounded monthly at the rate (s) stated in

             the Appendix to Bid upon on sums unpaid from

             the date upon which       the same should have

             been paid      in the currencies    in which the

             payments are due. The provisions of this Sub-</blockquote><p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">             clause are without prejudice to the contractor's

ARBITRATION APPEAL NO. 32 OF 2007

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  6</span>

            entitlement under Clause 69 or otherwise".
</p>
<p id="p_15">Referring to the factual position, it has been held by the Court

below in paragraph 15 that in the 'Appendix to Bid', in respect of

the rate of interest upon unpaid sum in `Foreign currency' as well

as in `Local currency', the rate of interest was shown only in

respect of `Foreign currency' (24% of the due amount); whereas in

the case of `Local currency', it was left blank.      In the said

circumstances, the Court below observed that there was a

conscious decision on the part of the appellant, while submitting

the tender, that the party did not intend to claim any interest in

respect of the `Local currency'     (76% of the due amount).

Reference is also made to Ext. R1 letter issued by the appellant

confirming that there was no provision for interest on delayed

payment and that the appellant would not claim any interest in

future. That apart, the appellant had also issued Ext. C72, stating

that their commitment for not to claim any interest on the said

amount was to be treated as purely a `gesture of goodwill'.

Accordingly, a finding was rendered by the Court below that the

party had chosen to waive the claim for interest in respect of the

due amount to be paid in `Local currency', even though the

ARBITRATION APPEAL NO. 32 OF 2007

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  7</span>

agreement provided for interest on belated payment.

</p><p id="p_16">      8.     The appellant has got a case that Ext. R1 was got

executed under coercion. The learned Counsel for the appellant

also submits that the contents of Ext.C72 are very much qualified,

by referring to the particular payment effected under Ext.R1 and

that it cannot be taken to connect with the further/subsequent

payments. After considering the facts and figures, the Court below

held that absolutely no evidence was adduced to substantiate the

factum of coercion, particularly when the burden was on the

shoulders of the party who raised the said contention. It is also

observed in paragraph 15 of the impugned verdict that Ext. R1 is

dated 14.07.2004 and it was thereafter that, the claimant issued

Ext. C72 which is dated 3.08.2004; wherein there is no retraction

of Ext. R1 or as to any element of coercion. It was accordingly,

that the Court below arrived at a finding in the succeeding

paragraph that the said document was executed on `free will' and

that the bidder was very much liable to fill up the rate of interest in

the place provided in the `Appendix to Bid' and having not chosen

to do so, it had to be presumed that the party had chosen to waive

the same. The reference made by the appellant to <a href="/doc/710617/" id="a_3">Section 19</a> of

the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_4">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 to contend that the

ARBITRATION APPEAL NO. 32 OF 2007

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                    8</span>

Arbitral Tribunal is not bound by the CPC or the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_5">Evidence Act</a> is

rather wrong and misconceived. True, the mandate under <a href="/doc/710617/" id="a_6">Section

19</a> is very clear. But it doesn't mean that the Arbitral Tribunal can

resort to any arbitrary exercise or arrive at a finding on astrological

assumptions; which otherwise will be wrong and perverse in all

respects.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      9. The explanation offered from the part of the appellant,

that non showing of the rate of interest in respect of `Local

currency' was to have it claimed in the due course, does not

appear to be palatable to this Court; more so, when the liability to

pay interest was undertaken at the rate to be shown in the

`Appendix to Bid' and further when the appellant, with proper

application of mind, had shown the rate in the relevant column only

in respect of the 'Foreign currency'. It is probable, that the work

was awarded to the appellant, also taking note of the fact that the

bidder had chosen to waive the right to claim interest for belated

payment in respect of the `Local currency',           which actually

constituted the Lion's share (76%). It is also possible that some

other bidders would have been there, who might have quoted

appropriate rate of interest in respect of `Local currency', while

ARBITRATION APPEAL NO. 32 OF 2007

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                   9</span>

leaving the column blank with regard to `Foreign currency', or

sometimes, there might be some bidders who would have quoted a

very lower rate in toto. After considering the relevant aspects, the

work was awarded in favour of the appellant, presumably also for

the reason that the appellant's, bid was a better deal, having left

the column blank with respect to the rate of interest for belated

payment upon the unpaid sum involving `Local currency'.

</p><p id="p_18">      10.   The reliance placed by the appellant on the decision

rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Secretary, Irrigation

Department, Government of Orissa and others Vs. G.C. Roy

[1992 (1) SCC 508] as to the power of the Arbitrator to award

interest does not support the case of the appellant in any manner.

In the said case, the issue considered was, whether the Arbitrator

was having power to award interest 'pendente lite', when the

Arbitration Agreement did not contain any such clause. Observing

that the Arbitration Agreement did not contain any clause

prohibiting payment of interest and that there was nothing contrary

to the intention of the parties, the Apex Court held that in the

absence of any clause for interest, the Arbitrator was very well

within his jurisdiction and competence in awarding interest

'pendente lite'.   Unlike this, in the instant case, as already

ARBITRATION APPEAL NO. 32 OF 2007

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                     10</span>

mentioned hereinbefore, there is a provision        in the Arbitration

Agreement to pay interest in a specific/prescribed manner, making

it clear that it shall be at the rate as shown by the bidder in the

'Appendix to bid'. Since the appellant/bidder chose to quote the

rate of interest only in respect of the amount payable in 'Foreign

currency' (24%), while leaving out the Column blank in respect of

the rate of interest with regard to the quantum payable in 'Local

currency' (76%); the parties are very much governed by the above

specific terms of the contract. In the said circumstances, we are

not satisfied with the case put forth by the appellant with regard to

claim No.1, and the appellant is not expected to take a 'U' turn,

after winning the bid.     The finding and reasoning given by the

Court below are very much proper and no interference is called for.

</p><p id="p_19">       11. With regard to the remaining claim, i.e., regarding the

benefit of exemption from Excise Duty by issuing necessary

certificate, it has been held by the Court below in paragraph No.24

as follows;
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              "Admittedly, there is no term or provision in the


              contract for issue of Excise Duty Exemption

              Certificate as per this notification.    Counsel

              appearing for respondents has not brought to

ARBITRATION APPEAL NO. 32 OF 2007

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                   11</span>

            my notice any such provision in the contract or

            usage of trade to issue Excise Duty Exemption

            Certificate as claimed. The conditions for issue

            of Excise Duty Exemption Certificate as stated in

            the notification in Ext.C41 are not complied

            with."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_20">The learned Counsel for the appellant submits that the right to

have the said benefit arises from the notification dated 28.08.1995,

which was marked before the Arbitral Tribunal as Ext.C41. It is the

case of the respondent that the necessity or occasion for issuance

of any such certificate on the basis of the 'notification' does not

spring out from the terms of the contract and as such, there could

not have been any such recommendation or direction, as given by

the DRB (Dispute Review Board) or the Arbitral Tribunal, which

hence was rightly intercepted by the Court below.

</p><p id="p_21">      12.   The case projected by the appellant in the appeal

appears to be more based on the fact that the respondent has

already issued necessary certificates in respect of Cement, Steel,

Bitumen etc., whereas no such certificate has been chosen to be

issued with respect to HSD, Lubricants and Tyres, which are also

stated as very much `required for the project'. The learned counsel

for the appellant submits that the words used in the notification do

ARBITRATION APPEAL NO. 32 OF 2007

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                     12</span>

not mean that the materials should have been actually consumed

and that the exemption is meant in respect of the goods which

were actually `required for the project' and hence that, on liberal

interpretation, HSD, Lubricants, Tyres etc also would fall within the

purview of the notification.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      13.   Obviously, the above notification was issued in the year

1995 and is not with respect to the project in hand, though it may

be applicable to other cases as well. The procedure for issuance of

the relevant certificates is prescribed in the notification itself; which

stipulates that the manufacturer has to comply with the

requirements as specified therein and necessary certificate has to

be produced before clearance of such goods. Of course, duty is

cast upon the State Government, if such project has been

approved for implementation by the State Government and on such

an event, it has to be certified by the Principal Secretary or

Secretary (Finance), as the case may be, in the concerned State,

by stating that the said goods are required for execution of the

project. But issuance of certificate stands entirely on a different

pedestal and while issuing such certificate, the State Government

scope and requirement of the project, the State Government has

issued necessary certificates in respect of Cement, Steel, Bitumen

etc., while declining to issue such certificate in respect of HSD,

Lubricants and Tyres.    If the appellant is aggrieved of the same,

the remedy is stated as elsewhere; mainly for the reason that it

does not form part of the contract.     It has been observed by the

Court below that there is no provision in the contract with

reference to the said notification or as to the liability of the

respondent in this regard; thus leading to the inference which is

impugned in this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_24">       15. Absolutely, no material has been produced from the part

of the appellant to show that the observation made by the Court

below that there is no clause in the Agreement with regard to the

liability to issue any such certificate for exemption is wrong or

perverse.     No reference is made to any of the terms of the

contract, but for placing reliance solely on the `notification' and the

instance of issuing such certificates in respect of Cement, Steel and

Bitumen. This shows that the finding and reasoning given by the

Court below as to the absence of such clause in the contract stand

fortified and in the absence of any specific term in the contract, no

benefit could have been extended by the Arbitral Tribunal, directing

the respondent to reimburse the amount in respect of the Excise

Duty, which otherwise could have been covered by such

certificates. The finding and reasoning given by the Court below

are perfectly within the four walls of law and are not assailable

under any circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_25">       16.   In the course of arguments, the learned Counsel for the

appellant, referring to the mandate under clause 67.1 of `COPA'

submits that the recommendation of the DRB was effected on

02.04.2004 and that, since the respondent did not convey their

dissatisfaction with the recommendation stating that they were to

pursue further remedy by way of `arbitration' within the stipulated

time of `14 days'; it had become final on 16.04.2004. The learned

Counsel further submits that this issue was specifically raised

before the Arbitral Tribunal and was dealt with in paragraph No.

3.1 of the Arbitral Award. However, the same is stated as not

considered by the Court below, while passing the impugned Order.

The relevant portion of clause 67.1 of `COPA' reads as follows:



</p><p id="p_26">             "If    the    Board    has    issued    a

             Recommendation to the Employer and the

             Contractor within the said 56 days and no

          notice    of   intention    to    commence

          arbitration as to such dispute has been

          given by either the Employer or the

          Contractor within 14 days after the parties

          received such Recommendation from the

          Board, the Recommendation shall become

          final and binding upon the Employer and

          the Contractor.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
          Whether or not it has become final and

          binding upon the Employer and the

          Contractor, a Recommendation shall be

          admissible as evidence in any subsequent

          dispute resolution procedure including any

          arbitration or litigation having any relation

          to    the    dispute      to   which     the

          Recommendation relates.

          Engineer."
</p>
<p id="p_29">

     As per the above clause, the crucial date is not the date of

recommendation, but the date of receipt of such recommendation

from the Board. The contention of the appellant was only that the

ARBITRATION APPEAL NO. 32 OF 2007

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                    16</span>

matter had become final on 16.04.2004, since the date of

recommendation of DRB was 02.04.2004. Absolutely no case was

pleaded to the effect that the recommendation was conveyed to

the Government on a `particular date' and that the intention of the

Government was not communicated, despite the expiry of 14 days

from the date of receipt of such recommendation.         It is also

brought to light from paragraph No.3.1 of the Arbitral Award that

the DRB in their meeting on 12.06.2004 recorded that the

recommendation of the DRB had been submitted by the Engineer

to the Government for acceptance. Obviously, in the absence of

any specific plea, as to the date of receipt of the recommendation

by the Government and the expiry of the prescribed time, the

Arbitral Tribunal could not have considered the same and for this

reason, there is no finding in this regard as well. This being the

position, the contention of the appellant that the matter has

already become final, since the respondent had not acted in tune

with the stipulation in clause 67.1 of `COPA', does not hold any

water at all. It is also relevant to note that the award was passed

by the Arbitral Tribunal `on majority' and the dissenting member

has given sufficient and proper reasons with regard to the various

aspects on which the dissent was recorded; which appears to be

correct and sustainable.
</p>
<p id="p_30">      17.   The only remaining question to be answered is whether

the Arbitration Court was justified in having interfered with the

finding of the Arbitrary Tribunal in respect of the claims No.1 and 3

(interest and Excise Duty exemption) invoking the power under

<a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_7">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_8">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996. The law

has been laid down by the Apex Court in crystal clear terms in the

decision in ONGC Ltd., Saw Pipes Ltd. ([2003] 5 SCC 705 = [AIR

2003 SC 2629],. It has been held that if the award is contrary to

the substantive provisions of law or against the terms of the

contract which would be patently illegal, it could be interfered with

under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_9">Section 34</a> of the Act. Viewed in the above background, the

award passed by the Arbitrary Tribunal directing to pay interest in

respect of the belated payments/unpaid amounts involving local

currency as well as the direction to reimburse the amount because

of non-issuance of exemption certificate pertaining to Excise Duty

in respect of HSD, Lubricants and Tyres placing reliance on the

relevant notifications issued by the Government of India in this

regard were rather contrary to the specific terms of the contract

and beyond the scope of arbitration.        This being the position,

interference made by the Court below rejecting the claims in this

regard is perfectly in order and it is very much within the four walls

of the law.
</p>
<p id="p_31">      In the above facts and circumstances, the matter requires no

interference. The appeal fails and it is dismissed accordingly.
