               compoundable and now both the parties have settled the
               dispute and the matter has been compounded and therefore,
               the complainant has no objection for granting bail to the
               applicant. The applicant is in custody since 26.3.2017.
               Investigation is over, charge sheet has been filed and

               circumstance, he prays for grant of bail to the applicant.
</p><p id="p_5">                       Learned Public Prosecutor for the State submits that no
               sufficient ground is made out for releasing the applicant on bail,
               hence the application filed by the applicants be dismissed.

               the application filed by the applicant is allowed. The applicant is
