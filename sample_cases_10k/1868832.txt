      The petitioner has come to this Court with this petition for

issue of a writ of habeas corpus to search for, trace and produce

his wife and two minor children namely Ms.Sunitha Mathew,

Master Abin John and Master Albin John aged 34 years, 14 years

and 12 years respectively. According to the petitioner, he is

legally married to Ms.Sunitha Mathew. He is employed abroad;

whereas she and the children, are residing in India. According

to the petitioner, the alleged detenues were missing and their

whereabouts were not known. It was the apprehension of the

petitioner that the 3rd respondent, in collusion with his mother-

in-law, the second respondent, was illegally detaining his wife

and two children.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.   This petition was filed on 09/06/2010. It was admitted

on 10/06/2010. We were not satisfied, prima facie, that notice

deserves to be issued to the respondents.                   We directed the

learned Government Pleader to take instructions and posted the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(Crl) No.216/10             : 2 :</span>




case to 17/6/2010. On that day, the learned Government Pleader

took time and accordingly, the case was posted to this date.

</p><p id="p_3">      3.     Today,   when the case is called, the petitioner is

present. He is represented by his counsel. The alleged detenues

Sunitha Mathew, Abin John and Albin John are also present. The

mother of Ms.Sunitha Mathew, Smt.Amminikkutty is also

present. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the

intention of the petitioner was to array the said Amminikkutty,

the mother of Sunitha Mathew as the second respondent. By

mistake, the name of the mother of the petitioner was shown as

the second respondent. This is clear from the identical address

shown of the       alleged detenues and the second respondent,

submits the learned counsel for the petitioner. According to the

petitioner, the alleged detenues have been illegally taken away

by the 3rd respondent and the alleged detenues, along with the

3rd respondent and the mother of Ms.Sunitha Mathew, were

residing at the address shown in Pathanamthitta.

</p><p id="p_4">      4.     We interacted with the alleged detenue Ms.Sunitha

Mathew after lunch recess. She asserts that she is not under

illegal detention or confinement of anyone. According to her,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(Crl) No.216/10             : 3 :</span>




she is residing at Thiruvananthapuram now along with her two

minor children. She is working as a beautician. The petitioner is

not looking after her. The petitioner is guilty of matrimonial

cruelty. In these circumstances, Ms.Sunitha Mathew does not

want to go with the petitioner.      She knows the 3rd respondent.

The 3rd respondent, according to her, is a friend of her brother.

He has been of help and assistance to the alleged detenues. She

denied the allegation that she was married to the 3rd respondent.

She does state before us that the petitioner had earlier

contracted a legal marriage and he had married her without

getting the said marriage dissolved.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     5.      We interacted with Ms.Sunitha Mathew alone initially.

Later, we interacted with her in the presence of the petitioner

herein. The learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned

Government Pleader were also present. The alleged detenues

are not represented by any counsel. We have interacted with the

children also.     Both of them submit before us that they are

students of the 9th and 7th standards at the S.M.V school,

Thiruvananthapuram. They state before us that they would like

to reside with their mother and attend the school at

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(Crl) No.216/10               : 4 :</span>




Thiruvananthapuram.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     6.      In a petition for issue of a writ of habeas corpus, we

are primarily concerned with the question whether the alleged

detenues are illegally confined or detained. We are satisfied, in

the facts and circumstances of this case, that the alleged

detenues are not under any such physical detention or

confinement. They are mother and two children. The mother is

residing at Thiruvananthapuram along with the two minor

children. The husband is employed abroad. We are, in these

circumstances, unable to accept the contention that Ms.Sunitha

Mathew and her children are under any illegal confinement or

detention. We are hence satisfied that no further directions are

necessary in this writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     7.      Parties have several conflicting claims and assertions.

We feel it is not necessary to advert to all of them considering

the limited nature of the relevant controversy before us.

Disputes regarding restitution of conjugal rights, custody of the

children, validity of the marriage, the alleged illicit relationship

between the 3rd respondent and          Ms.Sunitha Mathew are all

matters which will have to be raised and resolved in accordance

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(Crl) No.216/10                : 5 :</span>




with law before appropriate fora.         We are not persuaded to

hazard any authentic opinion on those questions in this writ

petition.</p><pre id="pre_2">

      8.     In the result,

      a)     This writ petition is dismissed.

      b)     The alleged detenues Ms.Sunitha Mathew, Abin John

</pre><p id="p_8">and Albin John are permitted to leave the Court together along

with Amminikkutty, the mother of Ms.Sunitha Mathew, as

desired by them.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      c)     We make it clear that we have not intended to express

our opinion on any question except the question that Ms.Sunitha

Mathew and her children are not under any illegal confinement

or detention. Parties can solicit appropriate findings on all other

questions before appropriate fora.
