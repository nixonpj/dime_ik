BRIEF STT. AND REASONS FOR THE DECISION OF THE CASE:

</p><p id="p_10">            Registrar of Companies, Delhi and Haryana had filed these

two complaints against M/s Hilton Rubbers Ltd. (hereinafter referred

to as accused company). Besides the accused company, Sharad Raj

Kasliwal was also named as accused, being director of the accused


                                                                         Contd/-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   2</span><p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">               ROC    VS. M/S. HILTON RUBBERS LTD.
</p>
<p id="p_13">company for offences U/s 159/162 of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_2">Companies Act</a> for non filing

of annual return for the year 2002 and for offences U/s 162/220(3) of

the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_3">Companies Act</a> for non filing of balance sheet and profit and loss

account for the year 2002.
</p>
<p id="p_14">2.         The facts necessary for disposal of both these two

complaints, in nutshell, as stated by the complainant, are that M/s

Hilton Rubbers     Ltd., the accused company is a company duly

incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_4">Companies Act</a> and is having its registered

office at Badii Khalsa, Sonepat, Haryana.     It is further stated that

Sharad Raj Kasliwal, being director of the accused company is the

person responsible for the day to day affairs of the company. It is

further submitted that by virtue of provisions of <a href="/doc/1239729/" id="a_5">Section 159</a> and of

<a href="/doc/254673/" id="a_6">Section   220(1)</a>     of   the   Companies      Act,   the    Managing

Director/Directors/Principal Officers of all the companies are under a

statutory obligation to file with the Registrar of Companies, copies of

annual return and balance sheet and profit &amp; loss account within the

prescribed period mentioned in the relevant provisions.

</p><p id="p_15">3.         It is alleged in the complaints that the accused company as

well as accused, being its director, failed to file the required annual

return and balance sheet and profit &amp; loss account within the

                                                                Contd/-

prescribed period.    As per the complaints, accused company was

</pre><p id="p_17">supposed to file annual return with ROC for the relevant year on or

before 30.11.2002. It is also the case of the complainant that accused

company was under a statutory obligation to file copies of balance

sheet and profit &amp; loss account for the relevant years with ROC on or

before 30.10.2002. It is submitted that, as the same were not filed

within the prescribed period, hence the present two complaints have

been filed by ROC against the accused persons for the years 2002.

</p><p id="p_18">4.         After filing of the present complaints, accused persons

were summoned. Accused Shard Raj Kasliwal appeared for himself.

None had appeared on behalf of accused No.1 company.

</p><p id="p_19">5.         Finding a prima facie case for offences U/s 159/162/220(3)

of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_7">Companies Act</a> against accused Sharad Raj Kasliwal, requisite

notices U/s 251 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_8">Cr.PC</a> were given in both the cases, to which he

pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
</p>
<p id="p_20">6.         Complainant was thereafter called upon to substantiate its

case by examining its witnesses.
</p>
<p id="p_21">7.         PW1 Sh. Naval Kishore Gupta, during the course of his

deposition, proved the document regarding the proof of directorship as

EX.PW 1/1. He stated that accused Sharad Raj Kasliwal, being

                                                               Contd/-

</p>
<p id="p_24">director of accused company, as per their record, was the person

responsible for day to day affairs of the company. He deposed that

balance sheet and profit &amp; loss account as well as annual report for

the year 2002      were not filed with the office of ROC within the

prescribed period. Therefore, both these complaints have been filed

against the accused persons. He proved the complaint as Ex.PW1/2.

Opportunity to cross examine the witness was granted to the accused.

</p><p id="p_25">9.          Statement of accused Sharad Raj Kasliwal was recorded

U/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_9">Cr.PC</a> wherein accused Sharad Raj Kasliwal admitted the

case of the complainant and submit that the company is under BIFR

and therefore the documents were not filed till date and he prayed for

leniency.
</p>
<p id="p_26">10.         I have heard the arguments advanced by Sh. R.K. Tiwari,

prosecutor for ROC as well as by Counsel for accused. I have also

perused the prosecution evidence on record, statement of accused as

well as documents proved on record.
</p>
<p id="p_27">11.         In order to establish its case, the complainant was required to

prove that accused company and accused persons were under a legal

obligation to file the balance sheet and profit and loss account as well as

the annual return of the accused company with the office of ROC within the


                                                                    Contd/-

stipulated period.    It has also been established on record from the

</pre><p id="p_29">deposition of PW-1 which has remained uncontroverted on this aspect that

the annual return as well as the balance sheet and profit and loss account

were not filed within the stipulated period by the accused company.

Although a request for filing of the documents has been made on behalf of

the accused persons, however, the offence stands completed the moment

these documents are not filed with the office of ROC within the prescribed

period.
</p>
<p id="p_30">12.         Having regards to the material on record, I am of the considered

opinion that complainant has been able to establish its case against

accused Sharad Raj Kasliwal. Accordingly accused Sharad Raj Kasliwal is

convicted for offence punishable U/s 159/162 in complaint case No. 967/03

and for offence U/s 162/220(3) in respect to complaint case No. 966/03.
