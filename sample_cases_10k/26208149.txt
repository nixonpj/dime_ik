Vinod Kumar Vs. Kay International &amp; Ors.

23.05.2019
Order on application u/o 6 rule 17 CPC filed by the plaintiff.


    1.</pre><p id="p_1">            This is a suit for recovery of money based on the invoices
         towards supply of goods. In brief, the plaintiff has stated that
         the plaintiff used to supply wood/timber packing material to
         the defendant. The defendant was making part payments from
         time to time and a running account was maintained. As per the
         statement of account as on 31.03.2015, Rs. 87,57,992.87 was
         outstanding closing amount. Thereafter, the defendant only
         paid Rs.5,05,872 on 27.08.2015 leaving the balance amount of
         Rs.82,52,120.87. Towards recovery of this amount along with
         interest, the plaintiff filed the present suit in November, 2015.
</p><p id="p_2">    2.            It is stated in the amendment application that the
         defendant had been issuing C­Forms for various purchases
         made up to the end of financial year 2013­14 but not
         thereafter. It is stated that recently the plaintiff has received a
         notice dated 26.03.2019 sent by the Department of Trade and
         Taxes in which a penalty has been imposed upon the plaintiff
         due to non­submission of C­Forms. The total penalty along
         with an interest is Rs. 32,18,164/­. Vide the amendments, the
         plaintiff wants to incorporate the aforementioned facts and

Vinod Kumar Vs. Kay International &amp; Ors.
</p><p id="p_3">          wants to claim additional         relief for recovery of aforesaid
         amount of Rs. 32,18,164/­.
</p><p id="p_4">    3.            Defendant has filed reply to the application and has
         opposed it on the ground that the entire plaint is silent as
         regards non­furnishing of C­Forms and the new relief being
         sought to be incorporated will be hit by Order 2 rule 2 CPC. Ld.
         Counsel for the defendant further submitted that the relief
         sought to be incorporated is barred by limitation. In this
         regard, Ld. Counsel for plaintiff argued that when the suit was
         filed, the claim for demanding C­Forms had not ripened
         because C­Forms could be provided up to the end of the next
         financial year i.e. 31.03.2015 whereas the suit was filed in
         November, 2014.
</p><p id="p_5">    4.            I have duly considered the rival contentions. U/o 2 rule 2
         CPC, a suit must include the whole of the claim which the
         plaintiff is entitled to make in respect of the cause of action. To
         counter the objection of the defendant u/o 2 rule 2 CPC, the
         case propounded by the plaintiff is that C­Form could be
         provided even after filing of the present suit and at that time, it
         was optional for the plaintiff to ask for C­Forms. In other
         words, the argument of the plaintiff is that since the cause of
         action for demanding C­Forms had not arisen at the time of
         filing the suit, the bar u/o 2 rule 2 CPC will not be attracted. In
         my opinion, the amendments are not hit by order 2 rule 2 CPC.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS No. 59360/16                                                      Page 2 of 3</span>
<p id="p_6">Vinod Kumar Vs. Kay International &amp; Ors.
</p><p id="p_7">          The further question before the Court is whether the plaintiff
         be permitted to include a different cause of action that had
         partly arisen subsequent to filing of the suit. In my opinion,
         such permission should be granted firstly for the reason that
         through singly litigation, multiple interconnected issues can be
         adjudicated and multiplicity of litigations can be avoided.
         Secondly, the basic nature of the suit will not be altered. Lastly,
         the real question in controversy can be determined.
</p><p id="p_8">    5.            In view of the foregoing discussion, I find merits in the
         application under disposal and the same is allowed however,
         subject to a cost of Rs. 3000/­ to be paid to the defendant.</p><pre id="pre_2">
