                       W.P.(C)No.23539 of 2014
                     -----------------------------------
              Dated this the 3rd day of September, 2014

                            J U D G M E N T
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner, a member of the Kesavadasapuram Welfare

Co-operative Society Ltd. No.T.794, has filed this writ petition

challenging Ext.P1 election notification by which, an election to the

Managing Committee of the Society is proposed to be conducted on

14.09.2014. The proceedings have progressed substantially as per

the schedule notified in Ext.P1 and what remains is only the actual

polling that is to be held on 14.09.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. The contention of the petitioner is that, a number of

persons, who are ineligible to be included in the voters list, have

been included. It is contended that as many as 295 ineligible voters

are there in the voters list. Therefore, the conduct of an election

permitting the ineligible members to participate and vote would

affect the purity of the process of election, it is contended.

</p><p id="p_3">      3. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, though

the petitioner had submitted Ext.P4 objections pointing out the

above facts to the 2nd respondent on 28.08.2014, the same was not

considered. It is contended that, the 2nd respondent was bound to

consider the objections, to remove all the ineligible members and to

conduct the election permitting only the eligible persons to

participate   and    vote.       The     Special     Government Pleader

W.P.(C)No.23539 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    2</span>

Sri.D.Somasundaram appears for respondents 1 and 2. This writ

petition is posted before me for admission.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4. A perusal of Ext.P1 notification shows that, the preliminary

voters list was published on 08.08.2014.         As per the schedule,

objections to the draft voters list were permitted to be submitted up

to 5.00 p.m on 14.08.2014. The objections were to be considered

on 16.08.2014.       The final voters list was to be published on

18.08.2014.     Admittedly, the final voters list has already been

published.     Therefore, the petitioner's objections Ext.P4 was

submitted only long after the final voters list was published on

28.08.2014. In view of the above, it cannot be said that the 2nd

respondent went wrong in not considering the objections of the

petitioner. The final voters list was published after considering the

objections to the draft voters list, and what remains is only

submission of nominations and the conduct of polling. There is no

occasion for the final voters to be altered in any manner. The above

being the position, I do not find any infirmity in the action of the 2nd

respondent warranting an interference with Ext.P1 or the process of

election, as sought for in the writ petition.        The petitioner, if

aggrieved, has the remedy of challenging the election in a properly

framed election petition, after the polling is over.

</p><p id="p_5">      In view of the above, I do not find any grounds to entertain

this writ petition or to grant any of the reliefs sought for. This writ

W.P.(C)No.23539 of 2014
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  3</span>

petition is therefore dismissed. However, the dismissal of this writ

petition shall be without prejudice to the rights of the petitioner to

challenge the election in a properly framed election petition, later.
