       HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MAHABIR SINGH SINDHU

Present:     Mr. Rahul Sharma, Advocate,
             for the petitioner.

MAHESH GROVER, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">           The petitioner has filed the instant writ petition praying for

issuance of writ in the nature of mandamus directing the respondents to

conduct the Spot Round counseling as per seats lying vacant due to some of the

candidates not reporting for the seats. It is not in dispute that last round of

counseling was held on 10.08.2018 and the Central Seat Allocation Board is

the one prescribing the schedule for it. This agency had extended the reporting

time on the request which needed some more time to update the particulars of

the filled up seats. The last communication dated 13.08.2018 reads as follow:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "On request from some Institutes, the Pl Reporting module will be

             opened tomorrow from 10AM to 2 PM for 'updating Pl reporting

             details of candidates', in case it has been missed out."</blockquote><p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">            The respondents who were put on short notice considering the

urgency involved have not filed the reply but have apprised the Court upon

instructions that the reporting time lapses today at 2 PM. It is also stated by

learned counsel representing respondent No.3 that three seats are likely to

remain vacant as per the latest available information but they have expressed

their difficulty in conducting Spot Round Counseling as prayed for by the

petitioner as there are no directions from the Central Seat Allocation Board.

The last date prescribed for admission is 15.08.2018. Hon'ble Supreme Court

in Parshavanath Charitable Trust and others Vs. All India Council for

Technical Education and others, Civil Appeal No.9048 of 2012 decided on

13.12.2012 has observed that engineer courses such as IITs etc. offer valuable

seats which could not ordinarily be wasted considering that the country gains

from trained human resource. While giving directions for schedule of the

admission the Hon'ble Supreme Court has also observed that vacant seats

should be duly notified and advertised or seats should be filled positively by

15th August after which there shall be no admission, whatsoever be the reason

or ground. The respondents expressed their difficulty as they would not have

sufficient time to advertise considering that 15.08.2018 is a holiday. We are of

the opinion that although there is a constraint, considering that 15.08.2018

would be a holiday but looking at the fact that some of the students would

benefit in career, we direct that after process is over at 2 PM today, the

respondents shall display the vacant seats on the web site today itself and in

case they receive response from the desirous candidates, who otherwise are in

merit, they be offered the vacant seats so that they are not wasted. We are

conscious of the fact that even at the cost of some inconvenience, the

competent authorities shall facilitate such an admission by 15.08.2018 which is

the last date prescribed.
